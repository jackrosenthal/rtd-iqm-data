Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for December 5:

1. Transportation Funding Initiative Update - A coalition of business interests, elected
officials, transportation and multi-modal advocates and industry representatives continue
to meet to discuss future transportation/transit needs and assess the viability of a
statewide funding initiative. The Metro Mayors Caucus has taken a “go big or go home”
position and support a 1% sale tax increase, while other entities have indicated a
preference for a smaller sales tax increase and different funding mechanisms. There is
general agreement new funding would be distributed 45% to CDOT, 15% to a new
multimodal transportation options fund and 45% to cities and counties (split evenly).
Although state funds would not directly flow to RTD, several working assumptions are
favorable to the District: (1) RTD would be eligible to apply for mobility funds, and (2)
local funds would be fully flexible allowing local jurisdictions to partner with RTD to
advance projects. The Coalition is undertaking additional research over the next few
weeks and continues to discuss options with stakeholders around the state.
2. Citizens Advisory Committee – The Citizens Advisory Committee met before
Thanksgiving and expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to discuss current
focus areas and issues with many of you at the roundtable dinner in October. As a follow
up, I will be working with each of you to schedule individual meetings, after the first of
the year, with two CAC members to talk about specific ways they can support you in
your director districts. The Committee is also working closely with the senior leadership
and public engagement team to identify additional areas to engage.

Re:

December Board Update

RTD General Manager Genova, Board Chair Hoy, and RTD Executive Staff presented to the Transportation
Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) in early November with an update on the District’s activities. The
presentation was very well received by members.
BBMK and RTD Senior staff continue to meet with legislators on a variety of subjects to date we have met

BBMK, RTD Executive Staff and Michael Washington continue to have conversations with the proponents
of legislation to implement a low-income transit fare reduction pilot program to update these
organizations (CFI and 9-5) about the efforts of the working pass group. BBMK and Senator Moreno met
with RTD Executive Staff and Michael Washington to provide an update on the pass working group.
Senator Moreno appreciated the update and our continued outreach.
BBMK continues to meet on behalf of RTD with the lobbyists and lawyers for SCFD and the Special Districts
Association on potential legislative options to address the drafting error in 267.
BBMK is monitoring legislation to re-work the 811 one call system for any potential impacts on the District.
The Department of Health Care Policy and Financing is exploring working with RTD on a possible
discounted fare for members with a disability and seniors that are current participants in the Medicaid
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation Program. BBMK forwarded the information to RTD for review
and feedback.

FY 2018 Appropriations Outlook

• Deadline: Congress must pass another spending bill before December 8
deadline; likely another short-term extension until late December/early
January.

• Another CR: One or more short-term bills will provide additional time for
Congress to pass tax reform before turning to a full-year omnibus bill.
• Transportation spending levels:

• House and Senate 2018 THUD bills both fully fund transit and highway

formula programs at their FY 2018 FAST Act levels.

• TIGER funding: House $0; Senate $550 million. (Administration

requested $0.)

• New Starts funding: House $1.75 billion; Senate $2.13 billion.

(Administration requested $1.23 billion.)

• All below FY 2017 level ($2.41 B) and FY 2018 FAST Act-

authorized level ($2.3 B).

What does this mean for New Starts funding
for the Eagle P3 project?

• House and Senate bills would fully fund our Eagle P3 funding request:
• RTD’s FY 2018 request:
• $63.3 million

• President’s FY 2018 budget request:
• $63.3 million

• Pending House and Senate FY 2018 THUD appropriations bills: Both

fund the Eagle P3 project at $63.3 million.

• Must await a full-year spending bill: US DOT will not award grants under

discretionary programs (programs in the control of the Appropriators) in
the absence of a full-year spending bill.

• Bottom Line: Likely that no FY 2018 New Starts funding will be awarded

until after a full-year omnibus spending bill is enacted.

• Long-sought Highway Trust Fund revenue solution?

• Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF revenues

seen as “unfinished business” after FAST Act.

• Still broad bipartisan Congressional support: June letter from 253

House Members seeking long-term revenue solution in tax reform.

• But surface transportation funding is not a must-pass bill:

• FAST Act funds surface transportation programs through 2020.

• Other Trump/Congressional priorities: healthcare, tax reform, trade.

• Competing transportation priorities in FY 2018: FAA reauthorization,

autonomous vehicles.

• Same politically difficult revenue options: taxes on gasoline, oil and gas

production, vehicle-miles traveled.

Infrastructure and Tax Reform
• Congress’ current focus is tax reform:

• House passed its tax reform bill on November 16; Senate passed its bill on

December 2.

• House and Senate will vote on a final tax bill before the end of the calendar year.

• Early hope was tax reform could serve as a vehicle for a Highway Trust Fund

revenue solution or at least a one-time funding boost, neither of which are
included in the House or Senate tax bills.
• Republicans using tax reform to lower rates, not for new spending.

• Yet the gas tax debate continues:

• White House advisor Gary Cohn recently floated the idea of a gas tax increase

to the bipartisan congressional Problems Solvers Caucus.

• Senator Schumer recently voiced opposition to a gas tax increase as a

regressive tax; favors use of one-time repatriated revenues.

• Now playing defense: fighting to keep favorable infrastructure-related tax

provisions: private activity bonds, advance refundings, commuter benefits.

Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal

• Still much speculation and few specifics.

• Timing: Early 2018 after tax reform? Congress likely must vote on a bill by

May; thereafter the window for moving a bill starts to close, due to elections.

• Funding and Finance: Trump’s original proposal still stands: leverage $200

billion in Federal funding to attract a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure
investment.
• Financed through “both public and private capital.”

• Recent Trump statement that P3s are “more trouble than they’re worth.”

• Regulatory Reform: reducing or eliminating burdensome regulations to cut

red tape and advance project approvals more quickly.

• Secretary Chao asserts regulatory red tape is a bigger hurdle to project

advancement than lack of funding.

• Transportation stakeholders are not giving up on a HTF revenue solution; if

not in tax reform, then here.

Changes in transit programs?

• Authorizers reluctant to revisit carefully-crafted compromises in the
FAST Act.

• Authorizers want any additional Federal funding to be distributed

via FAST Act formula programs, in place through FY 2020.

• Republican-led Congress rejected Trump Administration proposals
to zero-out TIGER and new CIG funding in FY 2018 THUD bills.

• Where change is likely is in regulatory reform:

• WH Council on Environmental Quality focused on streamlining and

reducing permitting requirements on infrastructure projects.

• US DOT pulled back two-man crew rulemaking and sleep apnea

rulemaking for FRA-regulated operators.

• US DOT eliminated local hire pilot program for highway and transit

projects.

Recommendation for
Services Contracts

General

Board Meeting Date: December 19, 2017
On-Call

Construction

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to award contracts to Krische Construction, Gilmore
Construction Corporation, HPM Incorporated and T-Bone Construction Inc. for On-Call Construction
Services for one year, with four optional one-year extensions. The maximum cumulative value of the
four contracts, including all optional extensions will not exceed $30 million.
BACKGROUND
RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform construction on a work order basis for activities
like street improvements, and 16th Street Mall Repairs. We also had three contractors provide on-call
construction services over the past five years, and would like to continue that approach. The benefits of
this approach are:
 Ability to make emergency repairs quickly
 Ability to deliver smaller projects efficiently
 Shortened procurement time
 Shortened construction duration, and better quality
 Reduced public impact of projects
DISCUSSION
In September of 2017, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP NO. 17FH009) for supply/services
for On-Call Construction Services work. The goals of this solicitation were as follows:
 Provide finished products that meet RTD’s overall needs, including its Small and Disadvantaged
Business Commitment participation goals
 Meet the schedules established in the work orders
 Provide a safe and quality product
 Maximize improvements within the program budget
 Minimize inconvenience to the public
Three projects were included in the initial solicitation – Highway 287 & Niwot Road Park-n-Ride (PnR),
Thornton PnR, and Englewood Station High Block Repair.
For this contract, RTD has established a Twenty-Two percent (22%) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
(DBE) Goal. Award of a Contract (or Contracts) from this RFP are based upon “best value” competitive
proposal procedures. The evaluation criteria were:
A. Price
40%
B. Commitment to and substantive utilization of Disadvantaged
and Small Businesses
10%
C. Submitter experience and capacity to perform Work
25%

Packet Pg. 21

2.B.1

D. Organization, Key Personnel, and Major Participants

25%

On November 8, 2017 five proposals were received for the value of work to be performed in the price
range of $0-$2,000,000.
1. Krische Construction
2. Gilmore Construction Corporation
3. HPM Incorporated
4. T-Bone Construction Inc.
5. B & M Construction, Inc.
The evaluation team consisted of seven RTD staff members from procurement, engineering, and civil
rights. The evaluation team met on November 16, 2017 and scored each contractor’s written proposal
according to the aforementioned criteria. The following four firms were selected:
1. Krische Construction
2. Gilmore Construction Corporation (Certified DBE)
3. HPM Incorporated
4. T-Bone Construction Inc.
These contracts will be for general construction including but not limited to grading, drainage, utilities,
paving, intersection improvements, rail repair, site-work, landscaping, small buildings, and building
repairs. One contractor will be chosen for each work order, based on the value of the work order, and
capacity of the contractor to complete the work. It is the intent of RTD to distribute work orders on a
rotational basis factoring in: work order amount, contractor (prime and sub) capacity and availability to
do the work, and cost and price agreement. RTD intends to distribute work orders on an equitable cost
basis among the four contractors. RTD will evaluate, at its sole discretion, the capabilities of the
contractor to effectively deliver the work.
The maximum cumulative value of the contracts is estimated based on the current Strategic Budget
Plan, and the Annual Program Evaluation documents.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for Highway 287 & Niwot Road PnR and Thornton PnR are included in the 2018 Adopted Budget
as capital carryforward, and these projects are supported by FASTER grants from the Colorado
Department of Transportation. Funding for the Englewood Station High Block Repair is included in the
2018 Adopted expense budget. Funding for future work orders will be included in the budgets of the
projects for which the work will be performed.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Recommended Action: It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award contracts to
Krische Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, HPM Incorporated and T-Bone
Construction Inc. for On-Call Construction Services for one year, with four optional one-year
extensions. The maximum cumulative value of the four contracts, including all optional
extensions will not exceed $30 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Bid out each scope of work. This will increase
procurement’s workload, and result in delay to the implementation of projects, which will lead to
prices going up. Experience has shown that the benefits of the on-call approach are:
 Ability to make emergency repairs quickly
 Ability to deliver smaller projects efficiently
 Shortened procurement time

Contract Award for the Regional Bus Rapid
Transit Feasibility Study

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: December 19, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a professional services contract award to
Felsburg Holt & Ullevig to serve as the Contractor for assistance in the preparation of the Regional
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Feasibility Study for an amount not to exceed $1,250,000. Funding for this
contract is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the Regional BRT Feasibility Study.
BACKGROUND
By the end of 2019, many of the planned FasTracks capital projects will be in revenue service. While
the FasTracks program is not complete, it could be a number of years before the additional program
investments are financially feasible. The District now wants to explore opportunities for Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT), which offer the potential for mobility and access improvements at relatively modest
capital and operating costs. These BRT projects could include:





Projects that address existing and anticipated travel demands not met by current or
anticipated FasTracks projects;
Modest-cost BRT projects that could address travel demands that won’t be met by fiscally
constrained FasTracks but will support or transition to future FasTracks;
Projects that otherwise support or feed into FasTracks; and
BRT projects with independent utility.

As part of the transportation planning and funding process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the Regional BRT Feasibility Study in the 2016 -2021 Transportation
Improvement Program (Approved TIP). DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) grant funds to help fund this study. RTD is providing $250,000 in
matching funds.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in October 2017 for consultant services to assist with the
preparation of the Regional BRT Feasibility Study. The RFP included a 15 percent Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise (DBE) goal. A committee comprised of representatives from RTD, CDOT and
DRCOG staffs reviewed proposals submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications-based selection
process. The evaluation considered each team’s technical proposal in the areas of (1) Demonstrated
public transit agency BRT experience of personnel assigned to this project, pa rticularly the proposed
project manager; (2) Comprehensiveness of the work plan to the defined tasks; and (3) Project team
qualifications with transit-related innovation and best practices. The six proposing teams were led by
the following: AECOM; David Evans; Felsburg, Holt, & Ullevig; HDR; Michael Baker; and the
University of Wyoming – College of Engineering and Applied Science.

Packet Pg. 24

2.B.2

The selection committee short-listed two teams for interviews and is now recommending that a team
led by Felsburg Holt & Ullevig be approved by the Board. The committee found that the Felsburg Holt
& Ullevig team had the most relevant experience, including innovative approaches to study
preparation and BRT implementation. Staff is requesting that the Board approve this recommendation
and authorize the General Manager to negotiate a contract not to exceed $1,250,000. Upon
successful negotiations, the study will begin immediately and is expected to be completed by the
Spring of 2019. As noted above, the RFP established a 15 percent DBE goal. Felsburg Holt & Ullevig
has committed to meeting this with a DBE commitment of 15 percent.
The final product of the study will provide RTD with the identification and prioritization of corridor based or fixed-guideway BRT projects within RTD’s service area. Achievement of this goal will be
predicated upon development of evaluative criteria that can provide a quantitative and qualitative
basis for project prioritization. This study is not intended to prepare a subjectively -vetted project list,
but instead establish a technical rationale for prioritization and further policy discussion.
The proposed action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically
the sub goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT throughout
the District will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this study is provided through $1,000,000 in DRCOG TIP funds and $250,000 in RTD local
funds, approved in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to
approve a professional services contract award to Felsburg Holt & Ullevig to serve as the
Contractor for assistance in the preparation of the Regional BRT Feasibility Study for an
amount not to exceed $1,250,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Adopted
Budget for the Regional BRT Feasibility Study.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a
professional services contract award to Felsburg Holt & Ullevig to serve as the Contractor for
assistance in the preparation of the Regional BRT Feasibility Study for an amount not to
exceed $1,250,000. This action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of
consultant services for the Regional BRT Feasibility Study, and will jeopardize the $1 million in
DRCOG TIP grant funding.

Preliminary Modeling Results
• Options as proposed do not reach the SBP revenue targets due to
proposed discounts.
• Ridership generated by discounts offered do not offset the revenue
losses due to discounts
• Cross subsidization within pass programs is creating unfairness between
participants; some are not paying their fair share; some are overpaying
• Right pricing (cash fare × trips taken) pass programs and reducing
discounts poses a risk to ridership and revenue as those that experience
an increase in cost may choose to dropout of programs

TOD Value Evaluation Guidelines
Purpose
• Guide internal decision-making around TOD projects occurring on
or adjacent to high-frequency transit facilities
Categories of Guidelines
• Principles - Six standards all developers are expected to meet
• Factors - Eleven elements of a development project that will be
considered for every project; divided into Tier 1 and Tier 2

14

Packet Pg. 52

2.C.2.a

TOD Value Evaluation Guidelines
Attachment: TOD Update (3332 : Transit Oriented Development)

Principles, 1-3

1. The TOD project must be budget neutral or budget positive for RTD.
Evaluations of budget impact should take into account direct revenue to RTD, including property
sale or lease revenue, increased fare revenue, or other revenue sources. Replacement, major
rehabilitation, maintenance, administrative, and other operational costs, as well as any capital
expenditures, should be considered over the long and short terms.
2. The TOD project must be expected to increase ridership.
The proposer must demonstrate that ridership will increase due to the project, and RTD must
concur with the analysis. Immediate increases are preferred, but long-term increases should
also be considered.
3. Where feasible, ground leases of RTD property are preferred over sales.
It is to RTD’s benefit to maintain fee interest in property, particularly property adjacent to
transit. In some cases, such as condo development or an unfavorable economy, a ground lease
may not be feasible, and a land sale should be considered.
15

Packet Pg. 53

2.C.2.a

TOD Value Evaluation Guidelines
Attachment: TOD Update (3332 : Transit Oriented Development)

Principles, 4-6

4. The TOD project must reflect the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP).
In particular, RTD will evaluate third-party parking operations and parking replacement based
on the factors described in the PGP.
5. The TOD project must enhance safety and security.
The TOD project should positively contribute to the safety and security of the RTD system by
remedying any known problems at the site, as well as by addressing issues of pedestrian safety
and walkability, and by increasing “eyes on the street” through activation.
6. The TOD project must have jurisdictional support.
The TOD project must be consistent with the local jurisdiction’s plans and the jurisdiction,
formally or informally, must demonstrate support for the project.

Packet Pg. 54

2.C.2.a

TOD Value Evaluation Guidelines
Attachment: TOD Update (3332 : Transit Oriented Development)

Factors, Tier One, 1-3
1. Ground Lease/Land Sale

Revenue from a land sale or ground lease supports RTD’s fiscal sustainability.
2. Increased Ridership/Fare Revenues
TOD projects that generate riders support RTD’s mission and directly benefit RTD
through increases in fare revenues.
3. Replacement or New Facilities
Leveraging development to provide new or replacement facilities that are needed
for transit operations supports a state of good repair. The value of the facility may
be large, such as for a new parking structure, or smaller, such as for a Driver Relief
Station.

TOD Value Evaluation Guidelines
Attachment: TOD Update (3332 : Transit Oriented Development)

Factors, Tier One, 4-6
4. Outsourced Maintenance

When developers take on maintenance responsibilities, such as landscaping, cleaning,
general maintenance, snow and ice removal, and graffiti removal, RTD’s maintenance
costs are reduced.
5. Jurisdictional Support
The extent to which a jurisdiction supports the TOD project beyond basic planning
demonstrates the importance of the project to the local community. Such demonstrations
of strong support might include updating zoning, providing financial support, employing
Tax Increment Financing (TIF), contributing to capital projects that support the TOD
project, or assuming part of the project’s risk.
6. Enhanced Operations
Improved operations may mean more efficient routing, more optimal transfers, or other
operational efficiencies.

Factors, Tier Two, 1-3
1. Improved Safety/Security

Safety and security improvements may address known issues at the location for
riders or RTD employees, such as emergency egress, lighting, trip hazards,
fire/life/safety communication systems, etc. The activation of previously isolated
stations also contributes to positive impacts to security.
2. Upgraded Rider Amenities/Access
Improvements to rider amenities or access include seating, vending, walkways,
open space, wayfinding, First Mile/Last Mile solutions, etc.
3. Community Facilities/Affordable Housing
TOD projects may provide space and/or facilities that directly serve the community,
such as community centers or affordable housing.

inherently support efficient multi-modalism, air quality improvements and
sustainable land use.
5. Brand Image Enhancement
Where RTD is positively associated with a project that supports community
objectives, its brand is enhanced and the agency as a whole benefits.

Re:

Inventory of Potential RTD Joint Development Properties

safely connecting
your city

This memo is intended to address Board questions that were raised at the October 31, 2017
Board Study Session related to providing an inventory of potential RTD-owned joint
development properties. Joint development properties are defined as properties that RTD owns
which have an active transit use that would need to be reconfigured, e.g., moving or structuring
parking, in order to integrate development at the site. The list of properties, identified by
category, is attached. The remainder of this memo provides an explanation of the purpose and
reasoning TOD staff used in classifying RTD properties.
In 2016, the RTD Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Assessment recommended that “The
TOD group should complete its analysis of station access, market, and community development
opportunities at stations and prioritize the best TOD opportunities based upon readiness for
development.” The TOD group began the recommended analysis with the following stated
objectives:
 strategically allocate staff time;
 manage expectations of value-capture potential;
 document transit operation needs;
 proactively plan for development; and
 improve RTD’s negotiating position with developers.
In addition to analyzing all rail stations, staff evaluated bus park and ride (PnR) facilities that
met the following criteria:
 RTD-owned property, where RTD may influence development;
 Property of greater than one acre that may support stand-alone redevelopment and
replace RTD parking; and
 RTD transit-service headways of 15 minutes or less during weekday peak period and
continued transit service during weekday off-peak periods and weekends, so that transit
service and development may each benefit from the other.
Staff then created the TOD Assessment of Potential Joint Development Sites, which categorized
all rail stations and qualifying bus PnRs based on their development potential, as detailed
below:
 Completed Projects: RTD has sold or leased land for joint development and the
resulting project is occupied;
 In Development: the sale or lease of RTD land for joint development is underway;

Sites with Potential: market conditions, political support, property size, site
accessibility, and infrastructure availability recommend these sites for TOD in the near
term, but further research is required to determine their true potential;
Monitor Transit Operations: changing transit service requires further examination
over time before any development can occur on site;
Monitor Development Activity: current market conditions would be unlikely to yield
a satisfactory joint development project, but the site should be re-evaluated as
development advances nearby;
Access/Infrastructure Investment Required: the site requires investment in
additional infrastructure such as roads and utilities to enable development;
Community Concerns about TOD: appetite for transit-oriented development in the
area is limited;
Stations under Construction: transit has not yet opened for service;
Existing Parking Garages: RTD structured parking precludes additional development;
Planned Stations: transit service is not yet funded at these stations; and
Insufficient Property for Stand-Alone Development: RTD owns too little land to
exclusively support development without partnership from adjacent property owners.

The attached figure and map identify all RTD rail stations and qualifying bus PnRs based on
their categorization. Also provided is a list of every rail station and qualifying PnR, including its
size, jurisdiction, daily boardings, parking capacity and utilization, and links to relevant planning
documents such as Station Area Master Plans.
The TOD Assessment of Potential Joint Development Sites captures transit-service provision and
market conditions at a moment in time. Staff will regularly update the Assessment to respond
to transit-service changes, local government actions, infrastructure investment, and market
conditions allowing sites to shift categories as conditions change.
The sites categorized as Sites with Potential are currently being evaluated at a more detailed
level in order to determine their true development potential. If the true potential of a site is
deemed to be great, the TOD group may recommend that RTD issue a Request for Proposals
for Joint Development for that site. Not only does the Assessment support staff in preparing
solicitations for redevelopment, it also permits a nimble response to unsolicited proposals from
developers. In addition to the Assessment, and in line with the Unsolicited Proposal Policy for
Joint Development approved by the RTD Board in December 2015, staff has created an
Unsolicited Proposal Procedure for Joint Development to clarify the unsolicited proposal process
and manage prospective development partners’ expectations for redeveloping RTD-owned
property.
