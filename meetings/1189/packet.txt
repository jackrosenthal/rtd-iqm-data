Dear Frank,
The City of Lakewood, West Metro Fire District and Jefferson County Emergency Communications
Authority want to first extend our appreciation to you and the Regional Transportation District team
for entertaining our request to work together on emergency communications systems.
The three agencies want to leverage the opportunity during west corridor rail line construction to run
fiber‐optic communication lines connecting Public Safety Answering Points (PSAP) in Lakewood and
Jefferson County. In doing so, this line will serve as a backbone for communications in the region for
other PSAPs extending up to Broomfield County. The agencies also propose that we extend the fiber
communications to include the ability to connect to the City and County of Denver.
After discussion with you and the RTD team this all appears possible. To understand the investment
cost for us we are submitting a description of fiber line and junction points (hand hole access) along
the way. A basic diagram depicts those as well as a list with some narrative descriptions.
We would appreciate your attention to size the cost as a engineering change to the existing RTD
communication system design. Please do not hesitate to call us with any questions or requests for
clarification. Again thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
