### B. JCECA Recognition

Frank Buczkowski, Senior Manager of Systems Integrations, read a letter from Jefferson County Emergency Communications Authority (JCECA) to the Board and introduced Jeff Irvin, the Executive Director of JCECA.  This letter can be found in the July 2, 2013 FasTracks Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.

Jeff Irvin further explained that JCECA serves local government agencies in both Broomfield and Jefferson counties. They collect an emergency telephone charge which citizens in each county pay when paying their phone bills and use it to fund 911 in the region. There are 28 local government agencies, consisting of mostly police and fire agencies, that form the JCECA inter-governmental agreement.  JCECA supports 10 public safety answering points, 7 of which are primary law enforcement communication centers and 3 of which are fire and EMS communication centers.  He then gave some details on Next Generation 911, which is IP based, including video, biometrics, and other types of information that can aid a first responder with some pre-arrival instruction to help save lives.  The opportunity with the fiber has been just incredible, Irvin related. RTD staff has been amazing to work with and JCECA has enjoyed a very professional relationship with the Board, which has fostered a one-of-a-kind project. As a representative of JCECA, he would like to thank RTD for the collaboration on enabling what is now and will continue to be in the future a highly secure and profitable network. Beyond the scope of the project JCECA is currently working on (from the Jefferson County government campus to the Auraria Higher Education Center), they are now working on a connection to the Denver Union Station hub and to the gold line, which will help us connect even more of our agencies in Westminster and Arvada. This has been an incredible effort which has continued to expand and which is providing an amazing opportunity for local government and public safety to create this network to serve all of the citizens in the metro area eventually.

#### 1. Northwest Area Mobility Study Board Update

Bill Van Meter introduced Chris Quinn as the planning project manager for the Northwest Area Mobility Study Board.  Mr. Quinn thanked the Board and provided the following status update.  He stated that when the planning staff got the most recent cost estimate about a year and a half ago, they realized they would not be able to construct the corridor immediately and it became their goal to provide the stakeholders with alternatives in the shorter term.  They selected HNTB as their consultant at the end of March and established a technical advisory committee and policy advisory committee consisting of elected officials of the region. On May 29, they held a collaboration summit to establish goals and objectives for a study which they would use to measure successful outcomes. Key tasks of the study include determining the remaining BRT funding priority for US 36, evaluating the possibility of segmenting the northwest rail corridor, evaluating the potential for extending the north metro corridor, and evaluating potential mobility improvements such as BRT type improvements in the arterial roadway network, as well as addressing issues of reverse commutes on the downtown express.  The two key pieces to keep in mind are that there are several decisions that they expect to have wrapped up by mid-summer and by March of 2014 they expect to have a final report of recommendations.

Chris Quinn then presented information in a PowerPoint presentation, which can be found in the July 2, 2013 agenda packet. He indicated that the general focus currently is on identifying problems and potential solutions/alternatives. Public involvement to date has included 2 telephone town hall meetings. The first meeting had about 5,300 participants and the 2nd one had about 5,400 participants. It was a pretty clear success and they would like to continue to use this tool in the future. Their website allows people to ask questions, submit comments and sign up for newsletters and to hear about activities. He then opened the floor for any questions.

Chair Anderson noted that there were 5,300 participants in the first meeting and about 5,400 in the 2nd.  She asked how many of the participants called-in each evening versus being reached through out-bound phone calls conducted by the contracted automated dialing service. The response was 35 from the first meeting and 48 from the second meeting.

Director Lubow expressed thanks for all the hard work that went into this study and is hopeful that the stakeholders can reach a consensus on the issue.

Director Bagley inquired about the PowerPoint slide regarding the key tasks of the study; he wanted confirmation that his perception was correct on what the various lines on the map in the presentation represented. Mr. Quinn confirmed that the green line is I-25. The next one is Weld County Road 7, and the purple is an alternative that follows CR7 and verges to miss some of the development from the last couple of years and by-pass development on State Highway 119. Then the furthest blue line heading north-south would utilize 287. The dashed line is where the existing line now goes out to the Bel-Mar, Belmont Towers. Director Bagley would be interested to know what the segment distances are and what the time sequences are going to be for the lines.

Director Walker asked if there is any flexibility in the number of open houses we can have. Mr. Quinn responded that this number is not set in stone. He stated that typically for this region and district we hold three; one in the north corridor, one in the middle, and one in the south end.

Director Hoy inquired about alternatives being studied to connect Longmont to the north metro line and whether a train from Boulder to Longmont is still an option. Mr. Quinn replied that all options are on the table and they want to emphasize that unless the voters were to change the plan, the northwest rail is of course in the plan.

Director Lubow asked if it would be possible to also explore the potential of using the UP right of way to Valmont. Mr. Quinn responded that it is something they want to keep on the table and although they do anticipate some difficulty, as it doesn’t quite reach Boulder, it’s not insurmountable by any means. Director Lubow then asked whether the data from the first town hall meeting around people indicating they liked the idea of receiving information via email would be taken into account and acted upon. Mr. Quinn assured the Board that email addresses are being accepted and they intend to send email blasts out as information continues to become available.

Director James requested more details on the alternatives to BRT mentioned in the PowerPoint presentation. Mr. Quinn gave the example that CDOT is currently in the process of evaluating a proposal from Swift Transit who wants to build a personal rapid transit along 119, connecting Longmont with Boulder, as a demonstration project. Knowing that there’s a little more traction on alternative technologies these days is encouraging and they want to keep an open mind when evaluating proposals.

GM Washington stressed how important it is to reach a consensus so we can pursue additional funding. The fact is that we don’t currently have the funding. We will be taking a very deliberate approach to administering the study this year and conveying the results early next year, as they will be instrumental in providing mobility options for not only the northwest corridor, but district-wide. Additional funding is absolutely necessary and cannot be procured until consensus is reached.
