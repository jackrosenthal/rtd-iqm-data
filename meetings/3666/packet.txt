BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Central Park Station Development Negotiation

June 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to negotiate and
execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with Ulysses Development Group for the future lease
and development of the real property located at 3801 N Ulster Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired what is now Central Park Station on the A Line from Stapleton Development Corporation
in two phases. In August 2010, RTD acquired eight acres for $1,057,047. Two years later, in July
2012, RTD acquired an additional 11.6 acres for $1,585,082. The land was originally purchased for the
Central Park Bus Facility and Park-n-Ride (PnR) and was later incorporated into the Eagle P3 Project to
serve the A Line. RTD purchased the property using federal grant funds under grant CO-03-0125. As of
2024, the bus facility serves as the operating base for nine routes (28, 37, 38, 42, 43, 65, 73, 88, and
105), and the PnR contains 1,521 spaces. The PnR is part of RTD’s parking management system but is
not maintained by Denver Transit Operators (DTO) through the Concession Agreement.
The subject of this Recommended Action item is the PnR’s westernmost parcel, located at 3801 N
Ulster Street, on the southwest corner of Smith Road and Ulster Street (the Property). The six-acre
Property has 651 transit parking spaces with very low parking utilization and very high development
potential. In February 2023, Ulysses Development Group (UDG) submitted Step 1 of RTD’s Unsolicited
Proposal Process for Joint Development (UPP), commencing a discussion between the developer and
RTD Planning staff. The UPP stems from the 2010 Board-adopted TOD Strategic Plan, which created a
more focused policy that guides RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities
near transit. That plan was followed by the Board-approved Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property
in 2015, which guides the UPP that developers must follow to pursue development on RTD property. In
2021, the Board approved the Equitable TOD Policy, encouraging the development of affordable housing
on RTD land.
In June 2023, UDG submitted the second step of the UPP, the Technical Review, proposing to replace
the site’s 651 parking spaces with approximately 800 units of affordable housing and community
amenities. The RTD Technical Review Committee, composed of Operations, Capital Programs, Safety

Packet Pg. 26

16.A

and Environmental Compliance, Transit Police and Emergency Management, Finance, Legal Services, and
Planning department staff, noted that parking utilization at Central Park stands at less than 30%, and
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had hovered around only 50%. With this information, and with the
certainty that approximately 800 affordable units would generate more customers than 651 empty
parking spaces, the committee agreed that the parking space reduction was appropriate. Finding no fatal
technical flaws in the proposal, the committee approved the site for potential development, obtained
concurrence from each committee member’s department leader, and notified UDG of the committee’s
findings.
Planning staff then sought concurrence and approval from the General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer (GM/CEO) to terminate the UPP and immediately issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to
develop affordable housing on the site. Departing from the UPP and proactively issuing an RFQ served
two purposes: first, it leveled the playing field by reducing UDG’s head-start on the project; second, it
streamlined the pre-development timeline by reducing the somewhat redundant review that is
purposefully built into the UPP. The UPP is intended for sites that are less desirable because such sites
only pencil under certain conditions and with the right developers. UDG’s proposal review demonstrated
that the Central Park site is more viable than previously thought because of changes in parking
utilization.
The GM/CEO agreed to the new direction, and Planning Department staff worked with the Contracting
and Procurement Division to issue the RFQ in November 2023. After a 90-day solicitation period, the
selection committee conditionally chose UDG based on its ambitious affordable housing program, access
to financial resources, and development experience. To continue to the next step in the joint
development process, RTD must execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with UDG.
DISCUSSION
If the Board adopts this recommended action, the agency may operationalize the 2021 Equitable TransitOriented Development Policy and further the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by creating much-needed housing near transit, improving
transit access, and generating revenues for RTD.
The ENA will address, among other items:
•
•
•
•

Negotiation and design schedule
Project financing
Development plan (density, use, affordability)
RTD maintenance and operations requirements

The ENA will permit a 24-month negotiation period, commencing on the effective date of the ENA.
However, RTD may extend the term of the ENA at its sole discretion. Board authorization through a
future action will be required to lease the Property to UDG and begin construction.

Packet Pg. 27

16.A

As discussed during the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, ground lease
payments will be key to the ground lease negotiation. Statutory changes enacted following the 2024
legislative session removed the requirement that RTD receive fair market value when disposing of its
land, instead leaving full discretion to RTD to determine the ground lease or sale value. The Equitable
TOD Policy, adopted by the Board in April 2021, indicates that RTD can be flexible on price, but includes
no other guidance. As a path forward, staff will return to the Board with a recommended framework for
land value discussion based on existing policy and thorough research on the topic.
If RTD and UDG do not execute the ENA, are unable to negotiate a ground lease or any other necessary
agreements, or if the Board does not authorize disposition of the Property through a future action, RTD
will remain the property owner and any subsequent decisions regarding the Property would be subject to
Board approval. Staff will keep the Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the ENA will have no financial impact to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
“Group 33” Fixed-Route Service Contract

June 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Transdev Services Inc. for the provision of fixed-route services as described herein. This
contract is for three years, with two one-year options for a total of five years, at a total not-to-exceed
cost of $186,603,968. Additionally, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $16,101,761 over five years. The total five-year not-to-exceed cost for services and
fuel is $202,705,729.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5 (2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. This service contract is referred to
as “Group 33,” which replaces the Group 29 service contract.
The service package consists of 109 buses providing approximately 284,861 revenue hours per year.
The routes provide service to the cities of Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Commerce City, Englewood,
Glendale, Highlands Ranch, Lakewood, Littleton, Lone Tree, Parker, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat
Ridge, the City and County of Broomfield, and the City and County of Denver.
DISCUSSION
A Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace the Group 29 service package was issued February 5, 2024,
with proposals due March 18, 2024, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process.
The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and was advertised via transit-industry-related
publications. During the solicitation period, one proposal was received. A panel of staff subject matter
experts assessed the proposal using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall
evaluation of the proposal, the panel recommends awarding the contract to Transdev Services Inc. The
term for the Group 33 contract will be for three years, with two one-year options, for a total of five
years.

Packet Pg. 38

16.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding will be included in the 2024 Budget for the provision of Group 33 services effective January 12,
2025. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s financial forecast and will be
presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each year’s respective budget.

Access-on-Demand - Additional Funding

June 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to designate
additional funding for the Access-on-Demand program in an amount not to exceed $8,600,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Paul Hamilton, Director, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD and its contractor partners deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,342 square-mile service
area, including bus, light rail, commuter rail, and microtransit services, as well as Access-a-Ride
complementary paratransit services in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
In November 2020, RTD launched its Access-on-Demand paratransit service within the umbrella of
Access-a-Ride. Access-on-Demand began as a supplemental demand-response pilot program in
partnership with transit network company Uber. The program’s goal was to provide a responsive, ondemand platform for paratransit customers, which was similar in operation to the agency’s Access-a-Cab
program as it existed at that time. The Access-a-Cab program provided alternative paratransit service
through private transportation providers.
The Access-on-Demand pilot program provided customers a per-trip subsidy of up to $20, and eligible
customers were required to pay the first $2 in fare for each trip. Access-a-Ride customers within four
ZIP codes, selected for their density of existing paratransit customers, were eligible to participate. The
program hours were between 6 and 9 a.m. and between 2 and 5 p.m. The program was later expanded
to an additional three ZIP codes and was expanded again to serve customers 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. During the pilot period, RTD continued to offer its Access-a-Cab demand-response service, for
which a $12 subsidy was offered, and customers were required to pay $2 in fare for each trip.
Following the Board’s approval of funding in November 2022 in the amount of approximately $9.3
million, in January 2023, RTD merged the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Cab programs. Since then,
RTD has partnered with four contracted private providers, Uber, Lyft, Metro Taxi, and zTrip, to provide
Access-on-Demand service. Customers travel using their choice of these providers, receive a subsidy of

Packet Pg. 40

16.C

up to $25 per trip, and pay no upfront fare costs. Additionally, customers schedule trips through the
providers’ mobile apps or call centers, as applicable, rather than via RTD’s Access-a-Ride call center.
Customers are limited to 60 trips per month and are responsible for monitoring their trip usage.
Due to the popularity of Access-on-Demand as an alternative to traditional paratransit services, demand
for service quickly exceeded expectations following the expansion of the pilot program in January 2023.
For example, ridership increased during the 2023 Zero Fare for Better Air (ZFBA) period on both Accessa-Ride by 7% and Access-on-Demand by 25%. The significant increase in demand for Access-onDemand service is likely due to the same-day convenience when booking an Access-on-Demand trip and
the elimination of the subsidy cap. During the ZFBA period, paratransit customers continued to receive
up to 60 Access-on-Demand trips monthly and additionally were able to travel anywhere in RTD’s
service area for zero-fare, that is, no out-of-pocket costs as the subsidy cap of $25 per trip was
removed.
To ensure customers have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD recently
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery. This on-site review was
conducted by industry subject-matter experts in late May 2024. These individuals engaged in a holistic
review of the paratransit program, including both the Access-on-Demand program and the Access-a-Ride
program. Their recommendations will assist RTD in adopting industry best practices, understanding the
agency’s strengths and opportunities with respect to paratransit service delivery, and determining
options for potential improvements, sustainability, and fiscal responsibility.
DISCUSSION
In considering this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Priorities of Customer
Excellence and Financial Success.
Based on projected continual growth in demand for Access-on-Demand, an additional $8,600,000 is
required in order to continue to provide Access-on-Demand services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the Access-on-Demand program, in an amount not-to-exceed $8,600,000, will be made
available through the unrestricted reserve. Future funding for this program will be allocated through the
annual budget process.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Agency Performance Scorecard Recommended Revisions

June 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt revisions to the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Agency Performance Scorecard.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager/CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions in late 2022 and throughout 2023 to develop tactics to improve
agency performance in specific areas. These tactics were distilled into three overarching Strategic
Initiatives for 2023 and 2024:
Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles.
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.

Packet Pg. 43

17.D

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve
community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.
For the performance period commencing September 1, 2023, and concluding July 1, 2024, each nonrepresented employee was required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed using the
SMART framework and based on the Strategic Initiatives.
These goals have been intentionally designed to drive and incentivize individual performance, which in
turn improves the performance of the agency overall. Moreover, the initiatives reflect a renewed
collective focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the Success Outcomes.
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

Customer Excellence

How is RTD achieving its
vision to be the trusted
leader in mobility?

How is RTD meeting
customers’ needs?

How has RTD delivered
value to the communities
it serves?

Employee Ownership

Financial Success

How well is RTD
How has RTD

demonstrated good
and engaged job seekers? stewardship of taxpayer
dollars?
How is RTD creating a
What is RTD doing to How has RTD developed
welcoming transit
inspire employees to build trust as the leader in
environment?
a career?
mobility?

In alignment with this effort, staff has developed a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard) that will provide answers to these questions and serve as an easily accessible
repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also be
expanded over time to house information related to the agency budget and financial reports, people
power statistics, and other key measurements. The performance dashboard will enhance agency
transparency and assist the Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
The performance dashboard launched in late May 2024.
DISCUSSION
As noted in the Strategic Plan document, and as contemplated by the Board and staff in 2021,
performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency metrics,

Packet Pg. 44

17.D

and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success outcomes is an
essential element of the Strategic Plan.
Draft revisions to the scorecard were developed by staff in collaboration with the Board Chair and
Performance Committee Chair, leveraging both the above-referenced open-ended questions posed during
the Board’s 2024 retreat, as well as a detailed discussion with the Performance Committee at its
meeting on May 21, 2024.
Further, staff is developing a separate annual scorecard related to agency performance driven by an
operational vantage point. Related to this scorecard, staff will define success and develop action steps
that tie into staff work plans, which stem from strategic initiatives, and other key drivers related to
agency performance, predicated upon annual survey data. The annual scorecard will be presented to the
Performance Committee as a draft no later than the September 2024 Performance Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the Agency Performance Scorecard
revisions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) Ballot Initiative

June 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number __, Series of 2024 submitting a
ballot question to the eligible electors of RTD at an election to be held on November 5, 2024, without
imposing any new tax or increasing any tax rate, authorizing RTD to continue to collect, retain and
spend all revenues it receives from whatever sources without regard to the limitations set forth in the
Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
TABOR is a 1992 voter-approved amendment to the Colorado Constitution that generally limits the
amount of revenue Colorado governments can retain and spend. TABOR requires voter approval to
increase taxes or retain excess revenues above certain limits that TABOR sets, as well as to issue
certain new multi-year financial obligations such as bond debt.
TABOR allows governments to retain and spend an annual amount based on the prior year’s actual
revenue plus a growth factor. For RTD, the TABOR annual revenue growth limit is determined by the
sum of the change in the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus the net change in
new property construction. Revenues collected in a fiscal year that exceed these limits must be returned
to taxpayers.
Colorado governments can and have implemented voter-approved exemptions from TABOR’s revenue
and spending limitations, either for a fixed period of time or indefinitely. Exemption from TABOR’s
revenue and spending limits is referred to as being “de-Bruced” in reference to the author of the TABOR
constitutional amendment, Douglas Bruce.
In 1995, District voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through 2005.
In 1999, voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through the period
required to pay bond debt issued to finance the construction of certain light rail lines but not past 2026.
This voter-approved structure includes the 0.6% RTD sales and use tax, is referred to as the Base
System. The Base System bond debt will be fully repaid in November 2024, which will subject all of

Packet Pg. 76

17.E

RTD’s TABOR-applicable revenue, except the 0.4% sales and tax levied for RTD’s FasTracks Project
(discussed below), to TABOR’s growth limitations beginning in 2025.
In 2004, District voters authorized RTD to collect an additional 0.4% sales and use tax for the FasTracks
Project. Approval of this ballot measure also authorized RTD to issue a fixed amount of FasTracks bond
debt to finance the construction of the FasTracks transit expansion elements. The approved ballot
measure requires the “sunsetting” of the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use taxes, after the debt is repaid,
to the amount necessary to operate and maintain these FasTracks elements. The FasTracks debt will be
repaid by 2050. Further, the FasTracks voter authorization only applies to the 0.4% sales and use tax
resulting in all other TABOR-applicable FasTracks revenues being subject to TABOR limitations in 2025
in addition to the Base System revenues.
All of RTD’s TABOR applicable revenues, except the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax, will establish
the basis for calculating revenue limits for 2025.
2024 budget revenues are $1,352.1 million of which $668.5 million or 49.4% is subject to TABOR.
DISCUSSION
TABOR revenue growth limitations will limit the annual allowable growth in RTD’s revenue collections
beginning in 2025. Revenue collected in excess of these TABOR limits must be returned to taxpayers.
These revenue growth limitations will likely adversely impact RTD’s future availability of funding.
In order to maintain and continue the 1999 voter authorization, and without imposing any new tax or
increasing any tax rate, the resolution submits a ballot question to RTD eligible voters at the election to
be held on November 5, 2024, authorizing RTD to continue to collect, retain, and spend all revenues it
received from all sources without regard to TABOR limitations.
The resolution includes the Board of Directors formal endorsement and support for the ballot question at
an election to be held on November 5, 2024. It authorizes and directs the General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO) or General Counsel to take all actions necessary or appropriate to effectuate the resolution,
including authorization to enter into intergovernmental agreements with each county clerk, and appoints
the General Counsel as the designated election official.
RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow LLP in regard to the ballot question and election.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this recommended action is to mitigate the financial risk associated with adverse
impacts to RTD’s revenue from TABOR.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

A RESOLUTION SUBMITTING TO THE ELIGIBLE ELECTORS OF THE REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT, AT AN ELECTION TO BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 5, 2024,
A BALLOT QUESTION AUTHORIZING THE DISTRICT TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT,
RETAIN AND SPEND ALL REVENUES IT RECEIVES FROM WHATEVER SOURCES
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN TABOR.
WHEREAS, the Regional Transportation District in the City and County of
Broomfield, the City and County of Denver and the Counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Douglas, Jefferson and Weld in the State of Colorado (the “District”) was created by the General
Assembly of the State of Colorado in 1969 by Chapter 231, Laws of Colorado 1969, which is
currently codified as Part 1 of Article 9 of Title 32, inclusive, Colorado Revised Statutes, (the
“Act”); and
