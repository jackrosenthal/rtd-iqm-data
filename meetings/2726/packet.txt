BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Administration

Date:

March 8, 2018

Subject:

Contracts for Legal Services

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: March 8, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: March 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute
contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside legal counsel to
represent RTD for a total amount not to exceed $8.5 million.
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD has received certain claims from RTD’s contractors for both the Eagle P3 and NMRL Projects that
may lead to dispute resolution or litigation. RTD has engaged certain law firms to assist RTD’s General
Counsel and the RTD Legal Services Division (RTD Law) to evaluate and initially respond to those claims,
as well as to administer and manage RTD’s efforts to preserve and collect information potentially related
to those claims. The approved 2018 Budget included funding designated and available for contracts with
legal firms engaged as outside counsel.
DISCUSSION
The General Counsel has determined that it is reasonably likely that one or more of the pending claims
involving FasTracks projects may lead to more complex dispute resolution and litigation requiring the
continued expertise and resources of outside law firms to represent RTD in those matters. The General
Counsel requests the Board’s approval to engage outside law firms, or amend existing contracts with
law firms, to provide legal representation in such litigation. At this time, the requested amount is the
best estimate of funding required for 2018. If litigation extends into 2019, a further recommended
action may be necessary.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed primarily with funding from the Board-approved 2018 FasTracks
project budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance and Administration
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and
execute contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside
legal counsel to represent RTD in a total amount not to exceed $8.5 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the Recommended Action is not adopted, RTD’s
General Counsel would need to find alternative legal representation for RTD, or would need to
obtain Board approval for individual contracts or amendments. This could seriously impair RTD’s
ability to satisfy its legal obligations and act in its own best interest in defending pending claims,

join

Colorado

Statewide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts Resolution ___ for RTD to join the Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP), a
local government investment pool (LGIP).
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
LGIPs are trusts established by local governments who desire to work together by pooling portions of
their investments to gain efficiencies of scale, reduce administrative costs and improve auditing and
transparency. There are currently three LGIPs in Colorado as defined in Title 24, Article 75, Part 7 of
the Colorado Revised Statutes. RTD currently participates in two of the three LGIPs, known as CSAFE
and ColoTrust, both of which have existed since the 1980’s. RTD’s Senior Manager of Debt &
Investments is the current Treasurer of the Board of Trustees for CSAFE.
In 2016, the SEC’s money market reform effort led to reduced choices for Colorado governments when
it comes to overnight liquidity investments. As a result, a new local government investment pool (CSIP)
was created in 2017 to offer additional diversity and choice for Colorado local governments and their
daily liquidity needs.
CSIP’s liquidity portfolio is AAAm rated by S&P. S&P describes the CSIP liquidity portfolio as follows:
“The Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP) is a statutory trust organized pursuant to the
provisions of Article 75, Title 24, Part 7 of Colorado Statutes. CSIP provides professional investment
services designed specifically to meet the cash management needs of Colorado governments, including
counties, municipalities, school districts and special districts. CSIP's goal is to help local governments
achieve their objectives of safety, liquidity, and competitive returns.”
CSIPs TERM portfolio is AAAf rated by Fitch Ratings, the highest rating in its category.
The investment manager and administrator for CSIP is PFM, the trustee bank is US Bank.

DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

Joining CSIP would offer RTD enhanced investment diversity and liquidity without adding any additional
cost.
CSIP is an allowable type of investment per RTD’s current Investment Policy and is similar in
characteristic to other investments currently made by RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Resolution would not create any cost to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves and adopts Resolution ___ for RTD to join the Colorado Statewide Investment
Pool, a local government investment pool.
2. Board modifies the recommended Resolution.
3. Do not adopt the Colorado Statewide Investment Pool Resolution. This is not recommended
because RTD would not benefit from reduced diversification and liquidity.

use of such name or designation is not practicable, legal or convenient, they may use such other
designation or they may adopt such other name for the Trust as they deem proper, and the Trust may
hold property and conduct its activities under such designation or name. The Trustees shall take
such action as they, acting with the advice of counsel, shall deem necessary or appropriate to file

designation.

lawfully becomes a part of the Trust, together with the income, appreciation or depreciation and
expenses, if any, therefrom, shall be held, managed and administered in trust, pursuant to the terms
of this Indenture. The Trustees accept this Trust and agree to perform the duties, responsibilities
and obligations under this Indenture allocated to them as fiduciaries.
2.3
Trustees’ Duties. The Trustees shall not have the right and shall not be subject to
any duty to demand or collect contributions from the Participants, or from any other person or
entity, or to enforce or attempt to enforce any agreement that may be considered to require
contributions to this Trust. The Trustees shall be accountable only for transfers and contributions
made to the Trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
The powers, rights, and obligations of the Trustees shall be established and governed solely
by this Indenture.

Purpose; Participant Requirements; Changes of Incumbency.

(a)
The purpose of the Trust is to provide a surplus funds trust fund in accordance with
Colorado law permitting Local Governments to pool monies available in their treasuries, which are
not immediately required to be disbursed, with the same such monies in the treasuries of other
Local Governments, in order to invest them and earn interest in accordance with, and as permitted
by, the provisions of the Investment Pooling Act and the Legal Investments Act or other laws of the
State of Colorado governing the investment of monies of a Local Government, and as allowed by
law. No Participant shall be required to appropriate any funds or levy any taxes to establish or
contribute to this Trust. The Trustees may provide for the payment or repayment of any expenses
from the earnings of the Trust.
(b)
Only those Local Governments which adopt this Indenture and have complied with
the provisions of this section may become Participants. The Designee empowered to invest funds
of each Local Government or such other person designated by the Participant to serve in such
capacity (an “Alternate Designee”), shall be the legal representative to act for and on behalf of
such Local Government for purposes of this Indenture.
(c)
Each Local Government adopting this Indenture, and otherwise complying with the
provisions hereof, shall become a Participant only upon adopting this Indenture and depositing
into the Trust the minimum total investment as that amount is established from time to time by the
Trustees. Whenever the balance in a Participant's account is less than the minimum established by
the Trustees, the Trustees may redeem the Shares and close the account; provided that thirty (30)
days’ prior notice shall be given to such Participant and redemption shall only be permitted if the
Participant has not restored the balance in the account to the minimum amount established prior
to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period which begins with the date of such notice. If the
Trustees change the minimum total investment to an amount greater than the investment of any
Participant at the time that such change becomes effective, the investment of such Participant shall
not be redeemed without such Participant's consent.
(d)
In the event that a Designee shall no longer be authorized to act on behalf of such
Participant as a Designee, and in the absence of any duly-appointed Alternate Designee, any funds
placed in the Trust by such Designee shall be held hereunder for the benefit of the Local
Government for which he or she was acting at the time the vacancy or termination of authority
occurred. Any Designee assuming office, either to fill a vacancy in such office or to begin a new
term following the expiration of the term in office of his or her predecessor, or otherwise becoming
authorized to act as Designee on behalf of such Participant, shall become the succeeding legal
representative of the Local Government by the Local Government filing written notification of such
with the Trustees in a form acceptable to the Trustees.
2.6 Trustees; Signatory Public Agencies and Participants. No Signatory Local
Government or Participant, nor any or its officers, employees, agents or representatives shall have
any liability under this Indenture as a result of service by its Designee as a Trustee.

Designee or an Alternate Designee, on the following matters: (a) Election of the Board, (b)

The Trustees shall determine any such challenge and their decision shall be final. The approval of a
simple majority of the voting Shares shall be sufficient to approve any action at a meeting or other
election of the Participants except as provided in Sections 10.4. and 14.1.

Termination of the Trust, and (d) Reorganization of the Trust shall be decided through a vote of the

incurred in any proceeding by an individual made a party to the proceeding because of his status
as a Trust Representative if he or she conducted him or herself in good faith, and (i) he or she
reasonably believed that his or her conduct was in the Trust's best interests or, (ii) in the case of
a criminal proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful.
(c)

investments of the Trust Property. Further, the Trust shall not indemnify any Trust Representative
under this Section either (i) in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the Trust in which
the Trust Representative was adjudged liable to the Trust, or (ii) in connection with any proceeding
charging improper personal benefit to him or her, in which such person was adjudged liable on the

participate in designating Trustees for the committee. If the said quorum cannot be obtained or the
committee cannot be established, or if such quorum is obtained or committee is designated and
such quorum or committee so directs, the determination may be made by independent legal

Representative who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition thereof if (i) the Trust
Representative furnishes the Trust a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he or she has
met the standard of conduct described in subsection (b) of this Section and a written undertaking
executed personally to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that indemnification is not
authorized under this Section, and (ii) it is determined as provided in subsection (e) above that the
facts then known would not preclude indemnification under this Section.

of the Trust shall be conclusively taken to have been executed by a Trustee or an officer, employee
or agent of the Trust only in his capacity as a Trustee under this Indenture or in his or her capacity
as an officer, employee or agent of the Trust. Any written instrument creating an obligation of the
Trust shall refer to this Indenture and shall contain a recital to the effect that the obligations

ARTICLE VII - INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
7.1
Beneficial Interest. The interest of the beneficiaries hereunder shall be divided into
transferable units to be called Shares, all of one series except as permitted by Section 7.10, without
par value. The number of Shares authorized hereunder is unlimited. Except as otherwise permitted
under Section 7.10 hereof, each Share shall represent an equal proportionate interest in the net assets
of the applicable series within the Trust. All Shares issued hereunder including, without limitation,
Shares issued in connection with a dividend in Shares or a split of Shares, shall be fully paid and
nonassessable.
7.2
Title to Trust Property. Title to the Trust Property of every description and the
right to conduct any affairs herein described are vested in the Trustees on behalf, and for the
beneficial interest, of the Participants, and the Participants shall have no individual interest therein
other than the beneficial interest conferred hereby and measured by their Shares, and they shall
have no right to call for any partition or division of any property, profits, rights or interests of
the Trust nor can they be called upon to share or assume any losses of the Trust or suffer an
assessment of any kind by virtue of the allocation of Shares to them, except as expressly provided
in this Indenture. Provided, further, that this provision shall not be interpreted or construed to
modify or limit any of the rights of Participants expressed anywhere else in this Indenture or as
provided by law. The beneficial interest hereunder measured by the Shares shall not entitle a
Participant to preference, preemptive, appraisal, conversion, or exchange rights of any kind with
respect to the Trust or the Trust Property, except as the Trustees may determine.
7.3
Evidence of Investment. Evidence of each Participant’s investment shall be reflected
in a Share Register maintained by or on behalf of the Trust in accordance with Section 8.1 hereof,
and the Trust shall not be required to issue certificates as evidence of Share allocation.
7.4
Redemptions. In case any Participant at any time desires to dispose of its Shares, it
may deposit a written request or other such form of request as the Trustees may from time to time
authorize, at the office of the transfer agent or at the office of any bank or trust company, either in or
outside of Colorado which is a member of the Federal Reserve System and which the transfer agent
has designated by the Trust for that purpose, together with an irrevocable offer in writing in a form
acceptable to the Trustees to have the Shares redeemed by the Trust at the net asset value thereof per
share, next determined as provided in the Information Statement after such deposit. Payment for

1.B.2.b

redemption shall be made to the Participants within the number of business days specified in the
Trust’s current Information Statement, unless the date of payment is postponed pursuant to Section
7.5 hereof, in which event payment may be delayed beyond such period.
7.5
Suspension of Redemption; Postponement of Payment. Each Participant, by its
adoption of this Indenture, agrees that the Trustees may, without the necessity of a formal meeting
of the Trustees, temporarily suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment
for withdrawal of funds from the Trust for the whole or any part of any period;
(a)
During which there shall have occurred any state of war, national emergency, act of
God, banking moratorium or suspension of payments by banks in the State of Colorado or any general
suspension of trading or limitation of prices on the New York Stock Exchange or the American
Stock Exchange (other than customary week-end and holiday closing); or
(b)
During which any emergency situation exists, as a result of which disposal by the
Trust of Trust Property is not reasonably practicable because of the substantial losses which might
be incurred, or it is not reasonably practicable for the Trust fairly to determine the value of its net
assets.
Such suspension or postponement shall not alter or affect a Participant's beneficial interest
hereunder or the accrued interest and earnings thereon. Such suspension or payment shall take effect
at such time as the Trustees shall specify but not later than the close of business on the business day
next following the declaration of suspension, and thereafter there shall be no right of redemption or
payment until the Trustees shall declare the suspension or postponement at an end, except that the
suspension or postponement shall terminate in any event on the first day on which the period
specified in subsection (a) or in this subsection (b) shall have expired, as to which the determination
of the Trustees shall be conclusive. In the case of a suspension of the right of redemption or a
postponement of payment to a Participant, a Participant may either (i) withdraw its request for
redemption or (ii) receive payment based on the net asset value next determined after the termination
of the suspension.
7.6.
Redemptions to Reimburse Trust for Loss on Nonpayment for Shares or for
Other Charges. The Trustees shall have the power to redeem Shares owned by any Participant to
the extent necessary (i) to reimburse the Trust for any loss it has sustained by reason of the failure of
such Participant to make full payment for Shares purchased by such Participant, or (ii) to collect any
charge relating to a transaction effected for the benefit of such Participant which is applicable to
Shares as provided in the Information Statement. Any such redemption shall be effected at the
redemption price determined in accordance with Section 7.4. hereof.
7.7.
Redemptions Pursuant to Constant Net Asset Value Policy. The following
provisions shall apply to any series or portfolio of investments of the Trust during any period that
the Trustees, in their discretion, establish a policy of maintaining a constant net asset value per Share.
If for any reason the net income of the Trust attributable to such Shares invested in the same portfolio
shall, at the time of any determination thereof in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Information Statement be a negative amount, then the Trustees shall have power to cause the number
of outstanding Shares of such series or portfolio to be reduced by requiring each Participant to
contribute to the capital of the Trust such Participant’s proportionate part of the total number of
4812-8920-8905.2

1.B.2.b

Shares which have an aggregate current net asset value equal as nearly as may be practicable to the
amount of the Trust’s net loss in respect of such series or portfolio. Each Participant, by becoming a
registered holder of Shares, agrees to make any such contribution which may be required.
7.8. Redemptions in Kind. Payment for Shares redeemed pursuant to Section 7.4. may, at
the option of the Trustees, or such officer or officers as they may duly authorize for the purpose, in
their complete discretion be made in cash, or in kind, or partially in cash and partially in kind. In case
of payment in kind, the Trustees, or their delegate, shall have absolute discretion as to what security
or securities shall be distributed in kind and the amount of the same, and the securities shall be valued
for purposes of distribution at the figure at which they were appraised in computing the net asset
value of the Shares.
7.9 Defective Redemption Requests. In the event that a Participant shall submit a
request for the redemption of a greater amount than is then allocated to such Participant, such
request shall not be honored and, each Participant, by its adoption of this Indenture, agrees that
the Trustees shall have full and complete power to redeem no more than the proportionate
amount allocated to such Participant, at a redemption price determined in accordance with Section
7.4 hereof, sufficient to reimburse the Trust for any fees, expenses, costs or penalties actually
incurred by the Trust as a result of such defective redemption request.
7.10 Series or Class Designations. The Trustees, in their discretion, may authorize the
division of Shares into two or more series, and within a series into two or more classes, and the
different series or classes shall be established and designated, and the variations in the relative rights
and preferences as between the different series or classes within a series shall be fixed and determined
by the Trustees; provided that, all Shares shall be identical except there may be variations so fixed
and determined between different series or classes within a series as to purchase price, right of
redemption and the price, terms and manner of redemption, special and relative rights as to
distributions on liquidation, conversion rights, and conditions under which the several series or
classes shall have separate voting rights and separate investment restrictions.

ARTICLE VIII - RECORD OF SHARES
8.1
Share Register. The Share Register shall be kept by or on behalf of the Trustees,
under the direction of the Trustees, and shall contain (i) the names and addresses of the Participants
(including both a post office address for regular United States mail and a valid electronic mail
address), (ii) the number of Shares representing their respective beneficial interests hereunder, and
(iii) a record of all allocations and redemptions thereof. Such Share Register shall be conclusive as
to the identity of the Participants to which the Shares are allocated. Only Participants whose
allocation of Shares are recorded on such Share Register shall be entitled to receive distributions
with respect to Shares or otherwise to exercise or enjoy the rights and benefits related to the
beneficial interest hereunder represented by the Shares. No Participant shall be entitled to receive

the merger, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy or insolvency of any Participant or otherwise,
by operation of law, shall be recorded as the Participant to which such Shares are allocated and shall
only be entitled to the redemption value of such Shares. Until the person becoming entitled to such
redemption value shall apply for the payment thereof and present any proof of such entitlement as
the Trustees may in their sole discretion deem appropriate, the Participant of record to which such
Shares are allocated shall be deemed to be the Participant to which such Shares are allocated for all
purposes hereof, and neither the Trustees nor the registrar nor any officer or agent of the Trust shall
be affected by any notice of such merger, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or
other event.
8.4
No Transfers of Shares. The beneficial interests measured by the Shares shall not
be transferable, in whole or in part, other than to a Local Government, or the Trust itself for purposes
of redemption. Any attempted transfer to any other person shall be void and of no effect.
8.5 Limitation of Fiduciary Responsibility. The receipt of the Participant in whose name
any Share is recorded or of any party or agent in whose name any Share is recorded for the benefit
of the Participant shall be a sufficient discharge for all moneys payable or deliverable in respect of
such Shares and from all liability to see to the proper application thereof.
8.6 Notices. Any and all notices to which Participants are hereunder entitled and any
and all communications shall be deemed duly served or given if (a) mailed, postage prepaid,
addressed to Participants of record at their last known post office addresses, or (b) sent by electronic

as recorded in the Share Register provided for in Section 8.1 hereof. Copies of such notices shall be
provided to the Participant’s Designee.

Alternatives
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute a new three (3) year RTD and ATU Division
1001 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) effective March 1, 2018 – February 28, 2021 for
all represented RTD employees.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager to execute the new CBA and instead require the General
Manager to continue negotiations. This is not recommended. The RTD and ATU have engaged in
good faith negotiations and have reached a tentative agreement. Rejection by the Board would
damage morale and would likely not result in further negotiations. The option would be to go to
interest arbitration, which leaves the decision in the hands of a third party. This most likely
would be more costly to RTD.

I. Introduction
The RTD Pass Program Working Group is a region-wide stakeholder group, convened by RTD the Senior
Leadership Team to examine pass programs and offer recommendations for changing those programs.
The working group members were selected for their connection to region-wide interest
groups/constituencies and their ability to bring a big-picture view of the pass program questions. They
were selected for their level of interest in these questions and the depth of their experience with RTD.
They were selected for their ability to work collaboratively, seek collective impact and build consensus.
They were selected because the group reflects the diversity of the region. They are:

II. Guiding Principles and Regional Interests
RTD Senior Leadership Team outlined a set of guiding principles to give focus to the working group’s
deliberation. They are:
 Cost-Effectiveness
 Equitable access
 Convenience

Meeting strategic budget
plan targets
Brand loyalty
Revenue certainty

 Simplifying rideroperator interaction
 Increased ridership

Packet Pg. 44

1.C.1

In the first meeting, the working group discussed their aspirations for this effort. The discussion
included these ideas and more:
- Increase choice
- Increase ridership and
motivate potential riders to
take transit
- Affordability
- Bring in a wider range of
employers
- Administrative ease
- Reduce barriers to riding
- Contribute to social
sustainability
- Create a system with
equitable prices

- Meet the needs of transitdependent – affordability,
availability, accessibility,
acceptability and
accommodation
- Increase the # of young
riders
- Create the right prices
- Create a system for
everyone in the region
- Increase mode share as the
region grows
- Increase regionalism

- Increase brand loyalty
- Expand availability
- Make transit a first choice
- Enable people to make
choices that fit the way we
live and meet the changing
expectations of our
population
- Equity
- Create a sustainable, lasting
system
- Make the system flexible
and adaptable

III. Public Input in Every Working Group Session
In addition to the working group’s deliberation, every meeting included an opportunity for interested
members of the public to speak to the working group. In general, those who spoke to the group were
advocates for specific pass programs and constituencies – low-income riders, college students, young
people, EcoPass holders, and Neighborhood EcoPass holders. Individual meeting summaries include
specific statements from the public.
IV. Options and Ideas
The working group examined a wide range of methods for generating the fare box revenue. The major
options were:
1. Drive the base fare down as far as possible by eliminating all pass program discounts (Option A)
2. Utilization pricing, a low-as-possible base fare (with no low-income program) and a pay-as-you-go
for employer and college programs (Option B)
3. Utilization pricing, a low-income program paid for with a higher base fare than Option B and a payas-you-go for employer and college programs (Option C)
4. Individual utilization pricing that reduces cost/trip as a rider rides more (Option D)
5. Retain current pass programs – EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and College Pass and add Lowincome and Youth pass programs (Option E)
V. A Single Approach and A Unified Package
Four Nines Technologies analyzed each option for its impact on total revenue and ridership. The
modeling results had one thing in common: eliminating pass programs resulted in the loss of ridership
and revenue. Once the group saw the analysis, they agreed that the only viable option would be some
version of Option E, a package that demonstrates the ridership and revenue benefit of retaining the
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and College Pass and adds a Low-Income Pass and a Youth Pass. After
detailed analysis of different discount levels and qualifications, the working group offers to the Senior
Leadership Team the following recommendation:

Packet Pg. 45

1.C.1

VI. Recommendations
The working group – having fulfilled its obligation to make a recommendation that could generate fare
box revenue at or above the RTD Strategic Budget Plan – recommends the following:
1. Low-Income Program
a. Consensus Recommendation – We recommend that RTD begin a low-income program with a
40% discount for those whose incomes are at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and
provide individual fares, day and monthly passes. Passes may be purchased by the individuals
or by partner organizations such as not-for-profit organizations and municipalities for distribution
to eligible individuals.
b. Item Requiring Further Discussion – Most of the working group support raising the low-income
discount to 50% for those living at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level, and raising
funds from new sources (see additional considerations below)
2. Young People
We recommend that RTD establish a 70% discount program for anyone 19 and under and provide
individual fares, day and monthly passes, and that RTD provide free transit for youth 12 and under
who are accompanied by a fare-paying rider. Passes may be purchased by the individuals or by
partner organizations such as schools, not-for-profit organizations and municipalities for distribution
to youth.
3. EcoPass
We recommend that RTD retain the EcoPass Program, regularly update SLAs, and price EcoPasses
to reflect the updated SLAs at the full, adult, non-discounted fare for the trips in each SLA group.
We recommend that EcoPass should be phased and right-priced by year three.

4. Neighborhood EcoPass
We recommend that RTD retain the Neighborhood EcoPass Program, and update pricing to reflect
the full value (including applicable discounts) of the trips. We recommend that RTD develop a new
way to set initial pricing for neighborhoods and reduce the barriers to entry. We recommend that
the Neighborhood EcoPass pricing be phased and right-priced by year three.
5. College Pass
We recommend that RTD retain the College Program and update pricing to reflect the full value of
the trips. Because the number of colleges in the program is small, RTD should initiate individual
discussions, in good faith, aimed at retaining the colleges in the program and transitioning to the
full value of the service, and should look to right-price the College Program by year three. We
recommend that RTD examine the applicability of the youth fare to the pricing of the College
Program.
6. Not-for-Profit Program
We recommend that RTD provide 3-hour pass and day passes to not-for-profits at discounts that
correspond to the low-income, senior/disabled, and youth passes.

Packet Pg. 46

1.C.1

7. Flex Pass and MyRide
We recommend that RTD retain the Flex Pass Program, but with no discount. We recommend that
the discount for use of MyRide card for fare payment be eliminated.
8. Transfer
We recommend that RTD eliminate transfers and institute a 3-hour time limit for each single-fare
trip.
9. Day and Monthly Pass
We recommend that RTD continue the day pass, priced at 2x the applicable base fare, and the
monthly pass priced at 38x the applicable base fare.
When technologically feasible, we
recommend that the day pass transition to an automatic fare cap when paying by smart card.
10. Contract Pricing
Should an organization approach RTD for a separate contract or agreement, we recommend that
RTD must only create contracts that embed the discounts and pricing described above and must
reject contract proposals that seek to alter qualifications or create greater discounts.
11. Ease of Accessing Pass Programs and Discounts
We recommend that RTD take steps necessary to remove barriers to access including researching
the possibility of allowing anyone to add funds to another’s smart card and ensuring that lowincome, young people and other groups receiving discounts have access to the best available
technology and fare media.
12. Implementation
We believe that RTD must link the timing of an increase in fares to the start-up date for the
recommendations for pass program changes; we recommend that RTD must start the programs and
the increase simultaneously. We recommend that RTD convene a working group, including some
members of the Pass Program Working Group, to support implementation of the eleven prior
recommendations.
VII. Assumption – Base and Regional Fare
In the modeling that we used to examine different programs and discounts, we used RTD policy and the
strategic budget plan to produce an assumption (not a recommendation) that the RTD Board of Directors
will review fares on its standard three-year schedule and that in 2019, the base fare could rise to no
more than $3.00 and the regional fare to no more than $5.25
VIII. Additional Considerations
The recommendations above satisfy the Pass Program Working Group charge to reach the strategic
budget plan target for fare-box revenue. The working group’s deliberation focused on the importance of
equity and the values that are realized through a low-income program – access to opportunity, mobility,
fairness, and creating a system that serves everyone in the region.
Throughout this year-long process, some members of the Pass Program Working Group have raised the
need to generate revenue to support or enhance the recommendations, particularly to provide the

Packet Pg. 47

1.C.1

revenue to move from a 40% to a 50% discount for the low-income program, and, after achieving the
50% level, to reduce pressures on the base fare and regional fare.
The following examples are not intended as an exhaustive list, and are not in the form of a consensus
recommendation; rather, they are examples for RTD consideration:
1. Continuing to seek external investment from institutions whose values align with the goal of
increasing equity and supporting the transit needs of the most transit-dependent riders.
For example, The PPWG recognizes that partners at the table, and their external stakeholders
have been working diligently to secure funding commitments from public and private sector
partners. For example, Mile High Connects and its partners have sought commitments that would
allocate $3.7m annually for the first 3 years to an affordable fares program. RTD could explore
the use of intergovernmental agreements to ensure the proper allocation of funding to implement
the proposed youth and low-income fare program.
2. Considering legislative action to increase revenue to RTD.
In the 2018 legislative session, a vendor-fee bill is an example. The bill would fund a low-Income
transit fare by reducing the vendor credit on large retailers. The bill could produce approximately
$10 million to support the low-income program.
3. Identify long-term, sustainable revenue sources of revenue, including these possibilities:









Amend limited authority to charge fees for parking to allow for parking fees to be incurred
within specific geographic/SLAs
Amend/repeal restriction allowing no more than 15% of a district parking facility to be set
aside for reserved parking
In conjunction with the amendment to limited parking fees, amend the provision of
retail/commercial goods to allow for the temporary use of public spaces (at or below market
value) by stakeholders in accordance with temporary local zoning allowances
Review internal contracts to identify better solutions to address internal challenges
Use long-term land leases and value capture to create a sustainable stream of income –
because real estate around transit investment in urban areas leads to appreciation in the
value of that land, and because RTD often acquires plots that will be non-critical to transit
operations and, thereby have remnant parcels that could be developed as TOD – RTD could
engage in long-term land leases with lease payments used to support pass program revenues

Pass Program Idea Refinement
• Incorporating the pass program ideas, the PPWG developed five options
• Options ranged from simplifying to expanding pass programs
Simplicity, elimination of
passes & pass programs
Option A
No discounts,
lower the cash fare

Retention & expansion of
pass programs
Option C

Option E
Unique discounts
for each program

• PPWG small groups refined three of the options for further evaluation

Quantitative Analysis & Fare Modeling
• The objective of the fare modeling was to understand ridership impacts
and how close the options would be to reaching the Strategic Budget Plan
revenue targets
• RTD’s Strategic Budget Plan has assumed fare changes every three years,
with the next fare revenue increase of 10% planned for 2019
• A baseline fare model was run to estimate the potential fares necessary in
2019 to reach the Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target
• This base fare was used to help in understanding the tradeoffs between
offering pass programs, discounts provided, and the base fare

Baseline Modeling Assumptions
• Baseline model was calibrated based on the FY2019 fare revenue target
• ~12% fare increase required to reach the FY2019 fare revenue target
• Local Regular One-Way Fare:

$2.90 (currently $2.60)

• Regional Regular One-Way Fare:

$5.00 (currently $4.50)

• Airport Regular One-Way Fare:

$10.00 (currently $9.00)

• All fares types remain and are assumed to increase by the same
percentage growth
• All current pass multiples and discounts retained

Initial Options Analysis
• The modeling of the three options resulted in a revenue shortfall
• Eliminating discounts did not result in a significant reduction in the cash
base fare
• Eliminating pass programs resulted in the loss of ridership and revenue
• The ridership generated by discounts offered do not offset the revenue
losses due to discounts
• A variation of Option E that retained the pass programs while offering
discounts to those who need the subsidy the most (i.e., low income and
youth riders) best met the desired outcomes of the PPWG

PPWG Recommendation
• Increase ease of accessing pass programs and discounts
• Introduce a Low-Income Fare Program
• Increase the discount for young people
• Continue EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass Programs, priced
based on cash value of trips taken
• Replace 3-hour one-way transfer with a 3-hour pass
• Retain day and monthly passes
• Link the timing of a fare increase with the start-up date for the
recommendations for pass program changes
• Initial modeling indicated that an increase in the base fare would be necessary
to reach Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue targets
14

Packet Pg. 63

Low-Income Fare Program
• An income threshold of 185% of the federal poverty level with minimum of
a 40% discount
• The Affordable Fares Task Force had previously been evaluating an income
threshold of 150% of the federal poverty level with a 50% discount
• The PPWG desired to expand access to the program by increasing the
income threshold
• Interest in increasing discount to 50% if funds available

15

• Increase the youth discount from 50% to 70%
• In addition to youth 5 & under, allowing youth 6-12 to ride for
free with a fare-paying rider
• The same discount would be provided to partner organizations
such as schools, not-for-profit organizations and municipalities
to purchase passes for distribution to youth

Recommendation Impacts on Revenue & Ridership
• Implementation of the recommendations will influence the revenue and
ridership generated
• Preliminary Modeling shows that the PPWG recommendations can be
implemented to meet RTD’s Strategic Budget Plan revenue targets and
retain ridership while increasing the discounts provided to those who need
subsidies the most [i.e., low income and youth riders] – pending further
analysis
• Determining how programs are implemented may have significant impacts
on the revenue generated and may result in difficult tradeoffs between the
cash base fare and reaching the Strategic Budget Plan revenue targets

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter of 2017. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance
measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 33 of the goals in the fourth quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q4, but performance is steady
to Q3 and improved in some areas over 2016. System-wide Local on-time service at 86.1%,
though not on goal, was higher than 2016 at 85.3% but slightly lower than Q3. In Local on-time
service, both Transdev and First Transit-Longmont met/exceeded goal while the remaining carriers
did not. Regional on-time service at 86.3% did not meet goal and was slightly below Q3. Staff
will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the
resources needed to improve such as service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail on-time service at 94.5% exceeded goal in Q4. Commuter Rail on-time service
at 95.1% also exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Improve Level of Customer Complaints
In responding to customer complaints, the overall average cycle time at 10.7 days in Q4 slightly
exceeded goal. One customer service position at Access-A-Ride was vacant for much of the year.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership for the year was down 1.9% compared to 2016, which mirrored the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 4.2% and 4.9%, respectively, over the prior
year, but did not meet respective budgeted goals of 5.8% and 5.8%. Fare revenue was much
higher in the first half of 2017 when compared to 2016 because the A Line was not running for
the first four months of 2016. Fare revenue began to “normalize” in the latter half of 2017 when
compared to 2016. Also, ridership declined more in the second half of 2017 than in the first.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization

Packet Pg. 75

1.C.3

Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to
attrition, retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: March 8, 2018

Board Meeting Date: March 13, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors, which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in November 2017. Per Board policy, we continue to report periodically on the status of the
Task Force recommendations below. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded
comments are provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds.
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate the new FasTracks lines opening in 2016 and further service modifications may come
forward with the opening of new lines. We will continue to assess service optimization.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses among applicable funds for both the Base System and FasTracks. While FasTracks
has met this objective, the Base System has not and is not expected to fully meet this goal within the
six-year term of the Strategic Budget Plan.

Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,
exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in January 2014. This
change in legislation has been challenged and the Colorado Supreme Court granted a Petition for Writ of
Certiorari. Oral arguments have been made and we are waiting for a decision.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating facilities and installed equipment and lighting
upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy upgrades throughout the District in the Strategic
Budget Plan. We will continue to address energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are
completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the University of Colorado A Line and creating
an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer BRT line. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate
sponsorship contracts will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, as well as
TOD activities. RTD continues to look for partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing
basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons that park longer than 24
hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature allowed daily parking fees only at nonDistrict facilities. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking management briefing at a study session that
focused on a consultant pay-for-parking study, parking management program update, and FasTracks
partnering projects.

Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As noted earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on
items taxed.

BACKGROUND
The 2018 Summary Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer early,
substantive input into the development of the RTD Annual Budget. The purpose of the attached
calendar is to assist Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the development of the
2018 Amended Budget, 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan [formerly known as the Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP) and FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE)], the Long-Range Financial Plan, and 2019
Budget. The GM’s strategic goals developed by the Board at the March 3rd Board Advance will be
incorporated into the 2019 Budget plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the Board to
provide guidance in:
(1) 2018 Amended Budget
(2) Determining the objectives of the 2019 Budget
(3) Understanding the key cost elements in the District’s annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to RTD programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing an understanding of departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for the
District to satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring
The suggested topics and timing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of keeping
the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the Board to
develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the Board in moving
ahead with this plan.
