Special Board Meeting
VINCE BUZEK: --before we lose anybody. Thanks. I'm now going to call the. Tuesday,
December 13, 2022 special Board meeting to order. We are convened as a 5:34 PM. I'd
respectfully ask everyone to remain muted unless you're recognized to speak.
Thank you all for joining us this evening. Please note that until further notice, the official

Ms. McManus, would you call the roll?
JULIEN BOUQUET: I believe Ms. McManus is on mute, unless I misheard something.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't even see her on-- oh, there you are, Barbara. Sorry. Could you call
the roll?
KATE WILLIAMS: We're not hearing her, even though her microphone-VINCE BUZEK: We can't hear you. It doesn't look like you're muted, but we can't hear you.
KATE WILLIAMS: While she's working on, maybe we can have Tai-Shrae call the roll.
VINCE BUZEK: Hey, Tai-Shrae, are you there?

KATE WILLIAMS: What he said.
VINCE BUZEK: With 10 present and 5 absent, we have a quorum. Going to move on to
public comment.
This is our public participation period, which is open to anyone who would like to address
the Board. If you wish to speak and have not already done so, please raise your virtual hand

or press star 9 on your phone. Staff will unmute you when it's your turn to speak. If you
are dialed in, press star 6 to toggle your mute settings.
Please bear in mind that by participating in this process, you are being recorded. If you do
not wish to be recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted in writing. If any
speaker has documentation or reference materials for the Board, or if any member of the
public would like to submit written comments, please email those comments to the Board
Office at rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com.
During this time, the Board will not offer comments or responses. Directors or staff may
contact speakers following their comments if they raise matters that lend themselves to
follow up. Speakers should begin their remarks by stating their names, and they will have
up to three minutes to provide their comments. Has anybody raised their hand, do we know?
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: There are no hands raised and there were no emails.
VINCE BUZEK: Very good. With no other participants in the queue, we'll close the public
participation period at this time, move on to other matters before moving into executive
session. Are there any other matters to discuss?
I see Shontel Lewis. Please go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Well, I guess I'd have to get off of mute first in order to be able to speak.
I wanted to take the time, because this is my last meeting, at least I think it is. If it's not,
please, someone tell me, and I'll continue on this journey with all of you.
And so I just wanted to say a few words, if that's all right with you, Chair Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Please, go right ahead.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you so much. So I'd like to first take a moment to thank all of you
that have relentlessly supported me through the times of challenge and abundance. Thank
you to our represented and non-represented staff that continued to show up when the world
was locked down, risking their lives for their livelihoods. You all are the lifeblood of our

transit agency, and I continue to be both in awe and gratitude from the core for the service
that you all provide.
I had no idea what I was stepping into when I decided to run. All I knew was the importance
of bringing those at the bus stops into the boardroom with me. It was in me as both a deep
conviction and commitment to those that rely on us to survive and ultimately thrive. I had
no idea of the growth and the pain in which I would experience in this role, in service to
those that elected me and those that did not.
I was in that pain-- it is in that pain that I found both my voice and my precision and my
pursuits to justice for each of you. We've been able to accomplish so much, including piloting
unarmed security, establishing rear door boarding during the onset of COVID, and our JEDI
resolution, just to name a few things. I am the thoughtful, nuanced, and principled leader
because of you all that walked alongside of me in this journey to ensure we were removing
barriers and creating access to transit.
Did we always get it right? No, but we never stopped fighting for those on the margins. And
I thank all of you.
I deeply grieved as I contemplated leaving this post because of how important my voice, my
experience, and my community is to this Board and to this seat. And so I thank you all for
trusting me to be in service to each of you for the past four years. It was not only a role
that I've ever taken lightly, nor have I ever taken it for granted. I may have missed a few
emails, returned a call too slow, or forgot about an engagement, but I've never forgotten
about the people who put me here. And I will never forget about the people.
I will leave the same way I came in, hopefully, curious and firm that if this decision-- in the
decisions that we are moving forward, that if we aren't putting people over our processes,
our policies and our procedures, then we're doing this all wrong.
While I'm leaving this post, I'm not leaving any of you, although some of you might want
me to. My fire for transit still remains. Thank you. Thank you to the late Director Deadwyler
for her service and her mentorship. I am because of her.

To my family and friends that have journeyed through the criticisms and the celebrations, to
my community for their steady support, and to the many individuals and organizations that
I've had the pleasure to co-create with, I love you all dearly. And to my colleagues and the
RTD staff, thank you for continuing to show up and to make lives better through
connections. It has been an honor. That is all.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you very much, Director Lewis. Thank you for your service. It's been
a wild ride. Thank you very much.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Indeed.
VINCE BUZEK: And this is my last, kind of my last meeting as the Chair. Executive
Committee, thanks. Board members, thanks. It's been great. But you'll have me for four
more years, so we'll just keep moving on. How's that?
Any other matters to come before this Board of Directors before we move into executive
session?
So, reminder, the first meeting of 2023 is scheduled for Tuesday, January 10. In a moment,
the Board is going to meet in executive session for consideration of personnel matters
regarding candidate finalists for Executive Manager Board Office recruitment.
Please note that the Board will reconvene in open session after the executive session ends,
with no further business on the special Board meeting agenda. I will now entertain a motion
to move into executive session pursuant to 24.64024 F1 CRS for consideration of personnel
matters regarding candidate finalists for Executive Manager Board Office recruitment and
Section 24 64024e CRS for determining positions relative to matters that may be subject
to negotiations, developing strategies for negotiations, and instructing negotiators regarding
compensation for finalists, and Section 464024b CRS for legal advice regarding the same.
I will now take a motion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved-KATE WILLIAMS: So moved.

ANGIE RIVERA MALPIEDE: Rivera-Malpiede.
VINCE BUZEK: Rivera-Malpiede. And Williams is the second. Got it. Are there anybody-anybody opposed to moving into executive session? Thank God, we only have 10 of you.
We need 10 of you to move in. We're going into executive session.
So we're going to come back to this meeting. Don't forget. So exit this meeting. Go to your
email for the executive session link. Hit that link. And then come back here when we're
done. See you there.
