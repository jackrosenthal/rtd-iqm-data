Smart Card Project Update

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: January 17, 2017
Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. in mid-2010.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
December 2016, 1.25M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the
public pilot program participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of January 1, 2017, approximately 1,930
cards were issued, of which 1,530 (79%) were full fare cards and 400 (21%) were discount cards.
The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was almost $48, with a total value
loaded of $342,000. There were 125,000 boardings using these MyRide cards with a fare payment
value of $276,000. Of these boardings; 70% were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses
are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and the B Line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R Line to
Aurora. 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

(no

For a variety of reasons, there has
been a small percentage of cards in
circulation that requires an
administrative action to extend their
usability. Remediation was made to
some of these cards in March 2016
which yielded positive results.
Challenges continue to remain and for
this reason, the status is shown as
yellow.

RTD and Conduent
continue to monitor.
Issues are documented
