#### 1. Resolution No.       , Series of 2014 Related to the Modification of Call Provisions on FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds, Series 2007A

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the modification of call provisions associated with certain of the currently outstanding Regional Transportation District, Colorado Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A.

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that he was very pleased to bring this recommendation forward to the Board.  He recognized Mike Newman from First Southwest and Sally Tasker from Butler Snow, who were a great help in putting this modification together.  He explained that this is a resolution to extend the call date on the 2007A Series Bonds (Bonds) from a call date of November, 2017 to November, 2024.  He introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, to discuss the key points of the recommendation.

Brenden Morgan explained that RTD has been approached by CitiBank N.A. (Citi), who owns approximately $220,825,000 of these bonds, to move the call date from 2017 to 2024; if RTD was to modify the call date then Citi would pay RTD a one-time payment of $15 million.  He noted that staff had to really question if this was a good dollar amount.  He said that he evaluated the opportunity as if it was a refunding of Bonds.  The RTD policy requires a return of 3% while this payment of $15 million works out to be about 6.88%.  He commented that this figure puts this modification in very comfortable territory.  Brenden Morgan stated that another key consideration in staff’s recommendation to move forward with the modification is that the transaction would not impact RTD’s FasTracks TABOR Debt Capacity in any manner.

Director Lubow noted that, not being a financial person, she has questions that may have obvious answers but they were not obvious to her.  She wonders why Citi was bringing this offer to RTD now.  She also wonders if it is possible for RTD to negotiate a better amount.  Brenden Morgan said he wondered the same thing.  He stated that currently Citi is in a unique situation where they hold a large number of these Bonds.  He explained that Citi buys bonds for a portfolio and then enters into swap agreements to hedge against these bonds; Citi has indicated to RTD that the swaps do not properly align with the average call date of Bonds in the portfolio so they are trying to fix this.   Brenden Morgan said that in terms of a better deal, there is only one entity that RTD can negotiate with, but staff is in negotiation conversations.  Terry Howerter pointed out that Citi does have additional options besides asking RTD to change the call date.  He thinks RTD is in an excellent position to receive $15 million with no impact on TABOR and no change in RTD’s future payments.

Director Menten shared that she views this transaction in a similar manner that she would view a home mortgage; if she was to give advice to someone she would recommended a 15-year term and that they should try to pay it off more quickly, therefore saving a lot of money.  She expressed concern that while RTD is receiving a one-time payment of $15 million, we will also be paying more interest since we are extending the time.  Terry Howerter explained that the bond maturity date, payment schedule, etc. will not be changing; this action is only related to extending the call date for the Citi owned Bonds.

Director Bagley wonders if he is correct in saying that when Citi looks at their entire portfolio, they need to look at it from a balance standpoint; this is just an attempt by Citi to rebalance their entire portfolio and RTD’s bonds are just a piece of that portfolio.  Terry Howerter commented that he could not say it was a small piece, but it is a piece of their portfolio.  He noted that Citi had mentioned in conversations that they have done several of these recently, which makes it very easy for them to work with RTD.

Director James inquired if the request to extend the call date is something that happens from time to time or if this is a total anomaly.  Terry Howerter believes this is a fairly unique position for Citi to be in, as he does not know of any other organizations that have done the same thing.  He believes this is a great benefit for RTD.

Chair Sisk stated that he supports this recommendation because no one can predict what the interest rates will be in 2017; this action results in RTD receiving about $13.458 million after associated costs and buys some certainty, which he likes.  Chair Sisk asked if these funds would go back into the FasTracks budget for the unfunded corridors.  Brenden Morgan stated that the funds must be spent on a FasTracks project but there are no other restrictions.

Director Hoy wonders if it would be fair to assume that the funds would go into the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  He pointed out that there is some precedence of funds from refinancings going into the FISA.  General Manager Washington said that staff would need to come back to the Board for a discussion on how the funds would be used.  He explained that staff has not yet had internal discussions about using the funds as they have been concentrating on getting the deal done.

Director Folska inquired if this recommendation will have any impact on RTD’s credit ratings.  Brenden Morgan shared that he has been in contact with the three agencies; staff anticipates there will be no impact and RTD is not required to get new ratings as a result of the transaction.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. RTD Resolution Authorizing Call Modification Documents (as filed)

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter pointed out that Section 10 of the Investment Policy Statement (Policy) states that the CFO should conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present any changes to the Board for approval.  He said the Policy has been reviewed by staff as well as RTD’s investment advisors and bond council.  He noted there was a red-lined copy of the Policy included in the November 18, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda packet.

Director Lubow expressed concern about the Policy because it appeared there were many red-line changes.  She said she got the impression that the underlying driver behind the changes was due to some statutory changes by the State, but she felt they were not really analyzed.  Director Lubow stated that she is uncomfortable approving something that has not been explained to her.  She feels she did not get the kind of information that makes her feel secure in approving the changes.

Committee Chair Walker thinks that over the next week the Board should review the Policy in detail and formulate some specific questions for staff.  Terry Howerter invited the Board to contact him and Brenden Morgan for any questions or if they would like to review the Policy further.   Director Lubow reiterated her request for a summary of the changes.

Director Anderson shared that it was her impression that these changes provide staff with more options for investments while maintaining safety and compliance according to State law.  Brenden Morgan said that was correct.  General Manager Washington expressed that staff is trying to be conservative while still maintaining a profit.

Director Solano feels the Investment Policy Statement and accompanying Board Report are very confusing.  He has a problem when the Board Report just refers to it as the “Policy”.  He expressed concern with it being too general and not clear.  He stated that he needs to have more information before he can even vote on this recommendation.

Director James asked if staff could expand the Discussion section of the Board Report to provide a brief summary of the rationale behind the suggested changes.  Brenden Morgan said that he would provide that to the Board.

Director Folska echoed Director Lubow and James’s suggestions of having the changes in a summary format.  She believes that would be very helpful.

Motion to

Postpone

to a Time

Certain:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to postpone the vote on the Adoption of the Investment Policy Statement to the December 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director James asked if there would be any consequences for RTD if the vote was delayed.  Brenden Morgan stated that he did not see any particularly negative consequences, problems or risks for RTD by waiting until the next meeting.

General Manager Washington reminded the Board that it is Board Policy for staff to bring this for approval on an annual basis.  He also did not see an issue in delaying the vote.  He said that staff would put together a summary of the changes prior to the next Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.

At this time Director Solano called for the question.  Director Lasater seconded.  The vote to end debate passed with Director Daly voting no.  The vote on the motion to postpone to a time certain was conducted.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion to postpone to a time certain for this item to be presented at the December 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee PASSED.  He encouraged other Board members to meet with staff to review the Policy.

This item was removed from the November Board Meeting agenda.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter introduced Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, and Susan Cohen, Manager of FasTracks Program Control, and asked them to review the key Budget elements with the Board.

Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that the process began in April when staff presented the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) which was subsequently adopted in May with an updated APE approved in July to include the Southeast Rail Extension.  She stated the first draft of the Requested Budget was presented in September followed by an update in October.  She said that tonight staff is asking the Board to approve that the final 2015 Recommended Budget be moved to the Board meeting for adoption.  Jannette Scarpino provided the following overview of the budget:

- Total District revenue is projected to be down 1.2% or $12.2 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due primarily to a:

o        decrease in fare revenue for the West Line of $1.6 million

o        decrease in grant revenue of $34.3 million

o        decrease in other income of $9.7 million,

This is offset by an:

o        increase in sales and use tax revenue of $31.7 million

o        increase in investment income of $1.9 million

- Operating expenditures on a combined basis in 2015 are budgeted $24.7 million lower compared to the 2014 Amended Budget due to:

o        completion of FasTracks expense projects, primarily the US36/CDOT managed lanes carryforward project

o        higher capitalization of FasTracks project salaries

o        decline in contract maintenance in FasTracks due to project completion, carry forward, or expense/capital transfers

This is offset by:

o        a $1.2 million increase in FasTracks Operations allocated costs for Denver Union Station and the Free Metro Ride

o        expense projects carryforward from 2014 totaling $33 million

- Diesel fuel is locked at $2.95 per gallon compared to a price of $312 gallon in the 2014 Amended Budget while gas is budgeted at $3.40 per gallon versus $3.54 in the 2014 Amended Budget

- Interest expense and debt payments are essentially flat over the 2014 Amended Budget

- New capital spending on a combined basis will decrease $318.6 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks

- Fund balances for 2015 on a District-wide basis is projected at $58.3 million, comprised of:

o        The Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million

o        The capital replacement fund on $19.2 million

o        An undesignated working capital fund of $12.7 million

Jannette Scarpino stated that Exhibit I outlines the full budget for Base System and FasTracks.  Attachment A is the Operating Budget Changes Since Posted Budget, Attachment B is a New Capital Projects summary and Attachment C is the Capital Carryforward Expenditures.  She reiterated that the next step in the process is adoption of the Budget at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Bagley noted that the FasTracks contingency reserve continues to remain at $30 million.  He wonders if those funds would go into the FISA as FasTracks projects get completed.  Susan Cohen explained that in the FasTracks financial plan the $30 million reserve will remain until all FasTracks projects are completed; at that time it would go back into the FasTracks fund balance and eventually pay for operations.

Director Bagley asked why there was a decrease in the FasTracks Board Appropriated, Capital Replacement and Unrestricted funds.  Susan Cohen stated that the Board policy requires there to be two months of operating expenses among the three funds.  She explained that since the operating expenses are projected to decrease in 2015, the require fund balances will decrease as well.

Director James pointed out that there has been a dramatic drop in fuel and oil prices over the last few months.  He wonders if it will be possible to buy fuel at prices lower than those we have locked in.  He said that the lock prices stated are higher than the price he pays for gas today.  General Manager Washington clarified that the lock prices are for diesel fuel, which currently sells for $3.40 per gallon at the pump.  Additionally, he said it is very important to consider that when diesel and gas prices are determined, staff is not looking at the price of gas today but are looking out over a 12 month period.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. Exhibit I 2015 Adopted Budget

##### b. Program Capital 2015 Adopted Budget

##### c. Attachments A-B-C 2015 Adopted Budget

#### 5. 2015 Proposed Internal Audit Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2015.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, shared that staff has put together an audit plan of 20 projects that they would like to complete in 2015 to include the following:

- Annual Audit Plan 2016

- Denver Transit Partners – DIA

- FasTracks Staffing

- HR – Position Changes

- HR – Salary Increases

- Investments

- IT Audit

- IT Staffing

- Kiewit Infrastructure Company – 1-225

- Marketing Audit

- Out of District Parking Fees

- Purchasing Card – FasTracks

- Purchasing Card – Finance Division

- Purchasing Card – Human Resources Division

- Review of HR Policies and Procedures

- Risk Assessment

- RTD Budget Process

- Smart Card Stored Value Development Process

- The WIN Program

- Update Internal Audit Policies and Procedures

She noted that the Board was given the opportunity to provide feedback/suggestions and asked if there were any questions.

Director Menten recognized that many government agencies have Purchasing Cards (PCards).  She said it has been shown that employees can buy certain gift cards like for a grocery or supply store.  She wonders if this is allowed for RTD PCards.  Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop explained that Internal Audit decided to do the PCard audits because it is an area that has a high risk of fraud.  She stated that RTD PCards can only be used to buy items that will be used for RTD purposes.  She said that Internal Audit has found that PCard purchases are scrutinizes by procurement on a regular basis and they have seen no instances of gift card purchases.

Director Menten asked if the PCard audit would review every transaction or would be done via a spot check.  Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop noted that due to the extremely large number of PCard transactions, Internal Audit would request every PCard statement and then select a random sample.

Director Menten inquired if it would be possible for someone to make a purchase on a PCard that appears legitimate but then is returned and the money is returned in a method other than a credit to the PCard.  She wonders what protections RTD has from that happening.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, pointed out that every PCard purchase must go through multiple approval steps; so, if someone buys an item for RTD and returns it, it is likely that someone within the department will notice that it never arrived.  General Manager Washington noted that when PCard transactions are purchased the original receipt is required which helps prevents this as well.

Director Tobiassen said he was happy to see the IT audit included as he had made that request.  He asked if Internal Audit would be working with Sheri Le, Cyber Security Manager, to determine the scope of the audit.  Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop said that she would be meeting with Sheri Le regarding the audit.

Director Lubow wonders if, in light of a recent allegation of wrongdoing, the audit process could be used proactively to avoid potential problems/allegations in the future.  General Manager Washington stated that the audit process would not be used to look at the alleged incident referenced by Director Lubow and that it was not an appropriate setting to discuss the matter; however, if a potential problem reveals itself through the normal audit process, the Internal Audit team will expand the audit scope as needed.  He said additionally, if there was an area of concern for management, they could request an audit as well, as had been done with this Internal Audit Plan.

Director Deadwyler stated that she was not aware that the Board could suggest audits.  She believes that several departments within Civil Rights need to be audited, especially EEOC and SBO.  She said that she has never been asked about what she would like to see in an audit.  She would like to see the Civil Rights area be audited.  General Manager Washington said that would be possible and noted that the WIN Program was included in the 2015 Internal Audit Plan.  He stated that a request was sent to the Board asking for their audit recommendations or suggestions, as is done every year.  Paula Perdue confirmed that the request was sent to the Directors.

Director Solano shared with the Board that he thinks an organization is only as strong as the weakest link.  He believes that right now RTD has a weak link but we do not know if it is truly a weak link or just an allegation.  This needs to be looked at microscopically.

Committee Chair Walker stated that RTD has many checks and balances and when something is found that can be improved upon, RTD deals with it; however, anyone can raise an allegation and he thinks the Board needs to move on from the issue.  Director Solano expressed an objection.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 2015 Audit Plan Proposed

#### 1. Third Quarter 2014 Internal Audit Report

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop noted that the reports were included in the November 18, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.  There were no questions from the Directors.

Terry Howerter noted that the update was included in the November 18, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.  There were no questions from the Directors.

#### 3. Third Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

Terry Howerter noted that the performance measures were included in the November 18, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.

Director Lubow feels that she really has no basis of comparison to know if RTD is actually doing well.  She wonders if perhaps the Board can be given information on other agencies for comparison.  General Manager Washington stated that this is something that transit agencies have tried in the past; however, it becomes very difficult to make comparisons when considering service area, types of service, population, etc.  He explained this is why staff brings goals to the Board for approval.  Terry Howerter commented that is also very helpful to look at performance trends.  He said if he notices something is getting worse he can look for reasons.  General Manager Washington stated that one of the goals of the performance measures is for staff to see areas of concern and then campaign the issue.

Director Tobiassen stated that he has been on the Board for 6 years.  He shared that in that time he has seen the most important performance measure for him improve considerably, which is the number of complaints he receives.  He believes this is an indication of the great work by staff and that the performance measures are working.

Director Folska commented that she has really seen an increase in complaints related to marijuana.  She wonders if that will become its own category.  General Manager Washington said that it would continue to fall under customer complaints; he does not see a new performance measure being created as it relates to marijuana.  Director Folska inquired if certain performance measures are weighted heavier than others, i.e. drunk driving, texting while driving, etc.  She feels that is more important than on-time performance.  General Manager Washington stated that the performance measures are not weighted.  He explained that this was an update; if the Board wants new performance measures the time to do so will be when staff brings the performance measures to the Board for approval in June or July.
