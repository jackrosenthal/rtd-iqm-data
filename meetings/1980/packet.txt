BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 13, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

November 13, 2014

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Resolution No.
, Series of 2014 Related to
the Modification of Call Provisions on
FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds, Series 2007A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the modification of call
provisions associated with certain of the currently outstanding Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A.
BACKGROUND:

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD”) sold its Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project),
Series 2006A (the “Series 2006A Bonds) in a principal amount of $600,000,000 in 2006. In April,
2007 RTD issued its Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the “Series
2007A Bonds”), in a principal amount of $363,725,000, to advance refund a portion of the Series
2006A Bonds, the principal maturing from 2030 to 2036 in the amount of $364,265,000, to realize a
reduction in interest expense. The amortization of the Series 2007A Bonds was structured similar to the
refunded principal of the Series 2006A Bonds, with the majority of principal maturing from 2030 to
2036. The Series 2007A Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of RTD on or after November 1,
2017. Since the Series 2007A Bonds advance refunded the Series 2006A Bonds, the Series 2007A
Bonds can be (i) advance refunded on a taxable basis at any time, and (ii) currently refunded on a taxexempt basis no earlier than August 1, 2017.
This action item discusses the modification of the call provisions of a portion of the Series 2007A
Bonds in exchange for receiving a onetime payment from CitiBank N.A. (“Citi”).
DISCUSSION:

The Series 2007A Bonds are currently outstanding in the principal amount of $360,310,000. Citi
currently owns Series 2007A Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $220,825,000, which
represents the majority of the principal outstanding in years 2030 to 2035, the details of which are set
forth in the following table:

Citi has approached RTD with an offer pursuant to which RTD would amend the call date of the Citi
owned Series 2007A Bonds from November 1, 2017 to November 1, 2024 against receipt of a one-time
cash payment from Citi. As of September 25, 2014, the payment from Citi to RTD was estimated at
approximately $15,000,000 assuming a closing date of November 20, 2014. The sale of the additional
call protection by RTD to Citi, with respect to the Series 2007A Bonds owned by Citi, can be analyzed
in the context of a partial refunding of the Series 2007A Bonds, with the savings of such “refunding”
realized in the form of an upfront-payment by Citi to RTD. If the proposal is accepted by RTD, the
Series 2007A Bonds owned by Citi would be subject to optional redemption by RTD as of November 1,
2024.
Copies of the Modification and Exchange Agreement and Second Supplemental Indenture of Trust are
available for review in the Board Office in substantially final form.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated payment by Citi of $15,000,000 represents 6.88% of the principal amount of Series
2007A Bonds owned by Citi. This is more than twice the (i) RTD threshold of 3.0% net present value
savings as a percent of refunded principal, and (ii) recommended threshold of 3.0% for execution of a
refunding by the Government Finance Officers Association.
RTD will need to make a one-time payment of approximately $1,400,000 to the IRS to satisfy RTD’s
arbitrage rebate liability relating to the 2007A bonds after this transaction is complete.
Costs of execution related to this transaction include fees for financial advisory, legal and other fees and
will be funded from the proceeds of this transaction.
Net funds received by RTD must be applied toward any FasTracks project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2014, authorizing the execution and delivery of a modification and exchange agreement and a
second supplemental indenture of trust relating to the districts Sales Tax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A, and other matters related thereto. This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2014, authorizing the execution and delivery of a modification and exchange agreement
and a second supplemental indenture of trust relating to the districts Sales Tax Revenue
Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2007A, and other matters related thereto. This

is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the one-time payment
currently available to the District.

From:

Date:

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2013. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
The Policy, among other things, outlines the investment objectives, standards of care, eligible
investment securities, credit and maturity parameters and diversification parameters. It is conservative in
nature and identifies its principal objectives as: safety, liquidity and yield, in priority order. The Policy
specifies reporting requirements and requires a system of internal controls designed to protect RTD
against loss of funds due to fraud, employee error or imprudent actions by employees.
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor in revising the
Policy. Changes being recommended are mainly in response to changes made to Colorado State
Statutes in 2014. Although some adjustments have been incorporated into the recommended Policy,
they do not significantly alter the intent of RTD’s current Policy.
Recommended changes are reflected in the attached redline copy of the RTD Investment Policy
Statement. A final version of the policy which includes all of the recommended changes is also attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement
1. PURPOSE

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.2.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Formatted: Left

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

Packet Pg. 16

1.B.2.a

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

Formatted: Left

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.

Formatted: Left

4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.

Formatted: Left

Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.

1.B.2.a

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").

This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 32

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

2. SCOPE

1.B.2.b

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 33

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

1.B.2.b

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
3
Packet Pg. 34

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.

1.B.2.b

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.2 Competitive Bidding

1.B.2.b

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody

For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.
8
Packet Pg. 39

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.

1.B.2.b

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body by
October 15, 2014. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2015 Requested
Budget for public review on October 12, 2014. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is
scheduled for the November 25, 2014 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 47

1.B.3

The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2015 Recommended Budget (combined Base
and FasTracks) is $1,385.5 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $518.5 million,
interest expense of $97.5 million, capitalized interest of $45.0 million, new capital expenditures of
$555.4 million, debt payments of $62.5 million, FasTracks contingency reserve of $30.0 million,
FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $18.4 million, Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million,
capital replacement fund of $19.2 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $12.7 million.
The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,303.1 million. The sum of the budget
appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,688.6 million.
Overview of the 2015 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $963.9 million on a combined basis are expected to decrease $12.2 million (1.2%) in
2015 from the 2014 Amended Budget. The decline is composed primarily of a decrease in fare
revenue for West Line of $1.6 million, a decrease in grant revenue of $34.3 million, and a decrease
in other income of $9.7 million, offset by an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $31.7 million and
an increase in investment income of $1.9 million.
Combined farebox revenues are budgeted to decrease $1.6 million or 1.3% based on a decline in
West Line farebox revenues in 2015 per the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation. Total Base
System grants are projected to increase $2.5 million over the 2014 Amended Budget, including new
and carry forward amounts. Drawdowns on Base System grants are estimated to total $85.7 million
in 2014 while new and carryforward grant funding of $119.6 million is projected for 2015.
FasTracks grants are budgeted to decrease $36.7 million from the 2014 Amended Budget due to
decreases primarily in West Corridor New Starts grants and CMAQ grants on Eagle and US36. Other
income will decrease $9.7 million due to the non-recurrence of DUS property sales in 2014. Sales
and use tax revenues of $535.1 million in 2015 are expected to increase 5.9% over the 2014
projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of
Business. Investment income is budgeted to increase $1.9 million from higher investable balances.
Operating expenditures on a combined basis in 2015 are budgeted $24.7 million lower compared to the
2014 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to: 1) completion of FasTracks expense projects, primarily
the US-36/CDOT managed lanes carryforward project, 2) higher capitalization of FasTracks project
salaries, and 3) decline in contract maintenance in FasTracks due to project completion, carryforward, or
expense/capital transfers, offset by: 5) a $1.2 million increase in FasTracks Operations allocated costs
for Denver Union Station and the Free Metro Ride, and 6) expense projects carry-forward from 2014
totaling $33.0 million. The expense project carryforward to 2015 is $15.1 million for Base operations
and $17.9 million for FasTracks Project.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $2.95 per gallon, compared to a price of $3.12 per gallon in
the 2014 Amended Budget, for a savings of $1.7 million. Gasoline is budgeted at $3.40/gallon, for a
$239,000 savings from both the 2014 Amended Budget and first draft Requested Budget in which the
budgeted price was $3.54/gallon.
The major changes in operating expense comparing the Recommended Budget to the previous Requested
Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested Budget are the
expense projects carry-forward.

Packet Pg. 48

1.B.3

Interest expense in 2015 is budgeted at $97.5 million on a combined basis, an increase of $1.9 million
over the 2014 Amended Budget and remaining essentially flat. Of total interest expense, $26.5 million
is budgeted for Base System and $71.0 million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest
(combined) is budgeted at $45.0 million for FasTracks only, unchanged from the 2014 Amended Budget.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2015.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $62.5 million, essentially unchanged from the 2014
Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $53.7 million are $5.0 higher due to issuance
of Base System COPs for fleet purchases. FasTracks principal payments of $8.7 million are $4.8
million lower due to lower actual debt issued than was anticipated in 2014. Financing proceeds from
the issuance of new debt is budgeted at $333.4 million, consisting of $59.6 million for Base System
for COPs and $273.8 million for FasTracks, the latter made up of $198.8 million for future FasTracks
construction and $75.0 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project construction. Total debt
issued will be lower by $462.2 million from the 2014 Amended Budget primarily due to a decrease in
FasTracks debt issuance.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2014 (previously approved
capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2015. The capital carry-forward
will be $1,303.1 million made up of $237.7 million on the Base System and $1,065.4 million on
FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis will decrease $318.6 million from the 2014 Amended Budget
due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease
$283.6 million to $460.9 million in 2015 due to on-going project completion on the East Line, US 36
BRT, North Metro and Northwest Rail, offset by increases to the Gold Line and the I-225 Corridor. For
the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $35.0 million to $94.5 million. Of this amount,
the Base system will spend $6.5 million less in park-n-Rides (primarily Stapleton) and $62.3 million less
on bus fleet modernization/expansion. These reductions will be offset by $11.7 million more on facilities
construction and maintenance (primarily Civic Center), $11.7 million more in capital support projects
(primarily IT support for the District), and $9.9 million more on LRT Transit (primarily rail cars). The Base
System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in July 2014 with certain
adjustments brought forward and disclosed in the previous Requested Budget.
New capital expenditures for 2015 and the change in new capital in the 2015 Recommended Budget
over the previous 2015 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in Attachment B. The
capital carry-forward expenditures for 2015 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2015
Recommended Budget over the 2014 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated reserve fund changes include an increase over the 2014 Amended Budget in the
Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance, which is projected to increase $4.7 million to $8.5
million due to projected savings in diesel fuel and gasoline and an increase in carryforward grants. Also
on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $22.2
million, and the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $15.0 million.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $3.4 million over the
2014 Amended Budget to $12.7 million. The $4.7 million increase in the Base System’s unrestricted
fund balance is offset by a decrease of $1.4 million on FasTracks. On a District-wide basis, both the
Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are projected to increase by $1.6 million each.

Packet Pg. 49

1.B.3

These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base
System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $100 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $60
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $40 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed. The 2015 budget reflects continued maintenance of the
FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30 million.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2015 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2015 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining unrestricted year-end
fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is for the total of these three
funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base
System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2015 budget reflects continued maintenance of
the FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve has been carried at $30
million since 2010.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2015 on a District-wide basis is projected at $58.3
million, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $26.4 million, 2) the capital replacement fund of
$19.2 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining fund balance of $12.7 million.
The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2015 is projected to total $45.7 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:


Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
 Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
 The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
 Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2015 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2015 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2014. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2014, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 PURCHASING CARDS – BUS OPERATIONS
AUDIT REPORT # 14-09-06

Purchasing Cards (PCards) are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and costeffective way to buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of
Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card Services that operates through Citibank. At
the current time, there are approximately 50 Citibank ‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to
RTD Bus Operations employees. Approval limits for Bus Operations purchases
generally do not exceed a $3,000 limit per individual transaction.
Year-to-date through August, these employees have spent an average of $89,000 per
month via their PCards. The current PCard arrangement generates a semi-annual
rebate to RTD of approximately 1.7% of purchases.
AUDIT SCOPE
The scope of our audit included recent activity during the first six months of 2014. We
selected individual Bus Operations employee PCard statements for review and testing
of supporting documentation and compliance with RTD policies including:





The procurement of appropriate goods and services for RTD business purposes
were within the employee’s assigned credit limits.
The monthly supervisory review and approval process was adequate and timely.
Individual transactions were not ‘split’ into two charges in order to qualify within the
employee’s credit limits.
PCard charges did not include Colorado state and local sales tax.
CONCLUSION

Internal Audit’s testing indicated that Bus Operations’ PCard expenses appeared to be
adequately documented and in accordance with written policy guidelines. We have
suggested that a consistent approach be developed to attach support for Business
Meeting costs charged to PCards, including a Purpose of the Meeting, and a list of
Meeting Attendees.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 PURCHASING CARDS – LIGHT RAIL OPERATIONS
AUDIT REPORT # 14-09-07

Purchasing Cards (PCards) are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and costeffective way to buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of
Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card Services, that operates through Citibank. At
the current time, there are approximately 12 Citibank ‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to
RTD Light Rail (LRT) Operations employees.
Year-to-date through August, these LRT employees have spent an average of almost
$82,000 per month via their PCards. The current PCard arrangement generates a semiannual rebate to RTD of approximately 1.7% of purchases.

Smart Card Project Status Update

INTRODUCTION
The Eco Pass and College Pass programs continue to gather valuable data through the taps registered
through the Bus Validators and Platform Validators. During the month of September 2014, 1.17 million
first boardings were registered through the Smart Media validators. This represents an increase over the
month of August 2014, mainly due to the start of the fall semester. In October, 1.25 million first
boardings were recorded by the bus and platform validators.
DISCUSSION
College/EcoPass Programs
Fall semesters have begun at the colleges and universities that are members of the CollegePass Program.
The Smart Media Technology (SMT) Program Team continues to work closely with the manager of the
CollegePass Program to ensure that new students are obtaining their SmartCards, as well as confirming
that returning students are getting their cards “recharged,” extending the validity of their SmartCard
until they graduate. EcoPass program support continues, and business participants have begun the
annual process of renewing their contracts with RTD for 2015.
Update on Smart Action List and File Compression
We previously described a system constraint identified in the Smart Media Technology relating to the
number of cards that the system can process when a SmartCard needs to be deactivated, suspended,
recharged or when a monthly subscription needs to be placed on the card. Working closely with our
Xerox Vendor Partners, we have launched two initiatives to remediate this issue



A method by which we can increase the amount of memory on both bus and platform validators
A “smart action list” that will prioritize frequently used cards and remove infrequently tapped
cards from validator memory

Four days of extensive testing took place the week of November 3, 2014. Almost 50 test cases were
performed in an effort to validate that the Xerox validator capacity solutions are viable. The SMT
Program Team reported an 85% success rate, but did identify one issue. A mitigation plan is already
under way with the help of Xerox. While the outstanding issue is being mitigated, the SMT Program
Team will conduct some additional exception testing, the results of which will be shared with Xerox.
Confidence is high that the capacity solutions provided by Xerox will perform as expected, with very
minimal impact to the SMT System.
Establish Business Processes in Support of the MyRide Program
With guidance from Smart Media experts from IBI Group, the functions of SmartCard Production,
Customer Service, Marketing & Sales, and many others are being discussed and documented. The focus
of this effort is to mitigate any risk associated with these business activities. RTD will also have a
“playbook” of sorts that outlines all the processes, roles and responsibilities that clearly outline how RTD

Packet Pg. 91

1.C.2

business units will manage and support the SmartCard program. Work on this initiative will continue
through the end of 2014 and into the first quarter of 2015.

SMT Engagement with Fare Study Committee
Members of the SMT Program Team are working closely with the RTD Fare Study Committee to provide
system-related guidance as the study progresses. As a result of this participation, the SMT Program
Team and Executive Sponsors have developed a “Product” rollout that will coincide with the activities of
the Fare Study. Our current goals include the go-live of Stored Value in Q3-Q4 2015, and we are
targeting the go-live of pre-paid media such as monthly and yearly passes as part of the potential
January 2016 fare policy adjustments.
SMT Involvement in the 2016 Rail Line Openings
The SMT Program Team continues to collaborate with FasTracks in preparation for the 2016 Rail Line
Openings. Initial discussions with RTD Police and Security have taken place to prepare for the
deployment of new Handheld Smart Media Readers on the new rail lines. We continue to collaborate
with the FasTracks Team on the implementation of network capabilities and platform validator hardware
to assist with the expansion.
Phase 1 Web Portal Enhancements
All of the Phase 1 Web Portal enhancements have passed rigorous testing with the exception of one
item related to SmartCard electronic Warehouse accounts and moving cards between RTD and Ride
Sponsor electronic accounts. Our goal is to have the Phase 1 enhancements implemented in December
2014.

Third Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
The Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2014 is attached. These year-to-date measures provide
a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met
18 of the goals in their entirety in the third quarter which compares favorably to 18 met in the second
quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District did not meet its goals as a whole for on-time service in Q3 and performance across-theboard weakened slightly from Q2. In Local on-time service, First Transit-Longmont actually improved
over Q2 results while First Transit-Denver fell minimally under goal in Q3. Only Veolia exceeded goal in
Q3. Staff continues to study the worst performing routes and identify the resources needed to improve.
Overall, on-time performance has shown improvement over 2013 as staff targeted efforts continue.
Delays have also arisen due to construction work in specific areas of the District, such as US36.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due to
several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavy/longer load time,
but the level of complaints has been consistent. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to
determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the valid issues.
In Q3, the three carriers RTD, First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded
goal. Both Veolia and First Transit-Denver remained static and marginally outside of goal. Staff provides
an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report.
The average time for final resolution of customer complaints improved in Q3 due to resolution of staffing
deficiencies; at less than 10 business days, the measure is within goal.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
In Q3, the measure was marginally below goal. The ADA carriers have found it difficult to hire qualified
operators. Job fairs and advertisement efforts are proceeding.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue, EcoPass Revenue, and Total Revenue
The District did not meet its goal for overall increase in fare revenue in Q3. We continue to research the
factors causing these variances and we expect year-end results to be more conclusive, but we believe

Packet Pg. 93

1.C.3

the variances are largely due to the timing of pass revenue recognition. We recognize pass revenue over
the year based on accounting rules and this does not coincide with actual sales and seasonality. Also,
the timing of actual pass sales in purchased transportation results in adjustments to revenue recognized
for a period and this appears to be a factor as well. As a result, Q3 fare revenue does not mirror the
ridership increase but the variability is expected to resolve at year-end.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus mechanics; however, the Q3 vacancy rate was lower than Q2.
We are experiencing a high level of vacancies in this category and recruitment efforts including job fairs
and college fairs are on-going. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local
economy.

Third Quarter Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2014 attached.
The U.S. economy expansion continued at a moderate pace (3.5 percent GDP) during the third quarter of
2014. The unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 5.8% but still remains elevated and
general inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
October Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Committee noted that this level will continue to
be appropriate “for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month,
especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee’s 2% longer-run goal, and provided
that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

3rd Quarter

1.C.4

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the third quarter of 2014 was 0.20% which
would produce annualized earnings of $367,791. The current return for the month of September was
0.16%.
