## I. Executive Committee Agenda

Chaired by Doug Tisdale

## II. February Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Tisdale reviewed the February Board Meeting agenda. He asked whether any groups had expressed interest in participating.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that there were some prospects.

John McKay, Board Office Administrator, said both Girl Scout and Boy Scout groups had indicated their interest.

Chair Tisdale asked whether any retirees were expected for the meeting.

Ms. McManus said that only one had confirmed.

Chair Tisdale stated, regarding the update from the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (GM Oversight), that Director Walker would possibly discuss proposed meeting dates. He noted the three items on the unanimous consent agenda and stated that the amended code of ethics would be included in the Board packet. He asked whether any Executive Committee members had any concerns about the items on the unanimous consent agenda or the recommended actions, and the members responded that they did not have further comments. He said he did not anticipate the need for an executive session or the discussion of old business.

Motion:               Chair Tisdale made the motion to approve moving the January 30th, 2018 Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Vote on

the Motion:               The motion passed with 5 in favor and 0 opposed.

## III. Other Matters

Chair Tisdale spoke about the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) hearing that took place that day in the same building. He said that the CPUC had authorized Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Garvey to proceed with a hearing, and he noted that the ALJ’s reporting was an investigatory function. He stated that the ALJ’s role was to compile information and ask questions posed by the Commissioners, after which he would report back to the CPUC regarding his findings so that they could then issue a final action regarding the previous decision to deny the waiver of the requirement to post crossing guards along the commuter rail lines. He noted that the hearing was unopposed, meaning that no other parties had presented evidence or arguments in opposition to RTD’s position. He said that three of RTD’s four expert witnesses had already testified and that the fourth was about to take the stand, and he said the process was going well. He commented that General Manager Genova had done a fantastic job of presenting testimony. He said it was likely that the hearing would not carry over until the following day.

Director Lubow whether the judge would make his own findings.

Chair Tisdale said the judge would make his own proposed findings, which would be formally adopted by the CPUC. He said he had encountered similar circumstances on the State Board of Registered Psychotherapists, where the State Board would refer matters to the ALJ, who then made findings and conclusions upon which the State Board had the right to appeal and decide upon that appeal.

Ms. McKillop asked whether the Commissioners were in attendance.

Chair Tisdale said that Commissioner Koncilja was there and spoke briefly but stated he had not seen the other two.

Director Deadwyler proposed that the Board present certificates of appreciation to Finn and Sully McKay for being the inaugural participants to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at the January 30, 2018, Board Meeting. She said she would like to personally give them restaurant gift certificates as tokens of her appreciation.

Director Menten said that taxpayer money should not be used.

Director Deadwyler confirmed that she intended to purchase the gift certificates herself.

Chair Tisdale said that the Board Members might choose to volunteer to provide such tokens of appreciation for future participants.

Director Deadwyler said that the entire group could be given a gift certificate if the Board chose to do so.

Director Lubow said she was concerned about providing a monetary reward for participants because groups might feel they did something wrong if they did not receive something.

Chair Tisdale said that the gifts would be private, not sanctioned by the Board, and that the gifts could be separately delivered to the recipients.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she would not want to make the gifts publicly known and agreed with Director Lubow that the Board would be setting an expectation. She agreed that it would be nice to provide a certificate of appreciation to participants.

Chair Tisdale suggested that Ms. McManus could provide a sample certificate and, with the committee’s consent, he would approve the final form.

Director Deadwyler asked if the certificate could include the signatures of the members of the Executive Committee.

Chair Tisdale agreed and said the certificates should also include a statement of appreciation of participation from the Board. He noted for the record that Director Walker joined the meeting.

Director Menten said that the Board began to discuss the GM Oversight process during the February 2, 2018, Board-only retreat but had run out of time. She asked Director Walker if he had any update regarding the potential for amending the General Manager’s core goals.

Director Walker stated that the core goals were part of the General Manager’s job description.

Ms. McManus noted that the General Manager’s goals for 2018 had already been approved and that any changes would apply in 2019.

Director Walker said that the GM Oversight Committee could discuss parts of the job description.

Director Menten said that, as Chair of the GM Oversight Committee, Director Walker would want to discuss changes to the core goals at the March 3, 2018, joint Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) retreat.

Director Walker agreed that was the appropriate time to talk about the General Manager’s core goals for 2019.

Ms. McKillop stated that the Board should be aware that changing the core goals would rewrite the General Manager’s job description.

Director Walker said that the committee could just reshuffle the goals or they could make changes that were more substantial.

Ms. McKillop said that she could provide the list of core goals used for other staff evaluations.

Director Lubow asked whether a change to the core goals would change the General Manager’s contract.

Director Deadwyler responded that discussion was about revising the goals.

Chair Tisdale asked whether the core goals were articulated in the current contract or whether the contract stated that the Board was responsible for setting the core goals for the General Manager.

Director Walker said that the contract stated the General Manager’s performance evaluation was based on his core goals.

Director Deadwyler asked who set the goals.

Director Lubow responded that the Board set the goals in the form of the General Manager’s contract.

Ms. McManus added that the evaluation also included the task goals that came out of the Board retreat. She said the core goals had not changed

Chair Tisdale asked what Director Menten was contemplating in revising the goals.

Director Menten said that she wanted to refresh the goals to account for the current situation at RTD and to analyze whether the goals were set too low or too high. She said that the General Manager’s contract stated that changes could be made for the following year’s goals if presented with proper notice in October.

Chair Tisdale asked whether it was fair to summarize Director Menten’s intent as being to discuss at the upcoming retreat whether the core goals should be modified or expanded for 2019, which would then give the Board ample opportunity to draft revisions and provide notice before the October deadline.

Director Menten agreed but said that she had not heard it stated specifically by others that the core goals could be changed. She said she did not see a problem in changing the core goals, especially if the Board gave sufficient notice.

Chair Tisdale, again to summarize, said that what he was hearing was that the question was not about proposing an amendment to contract, but rather that the contract allowed Board to annually review the General Manager’s, goals, strategies, and tactics. He said the Board had typically set three core goals for the General Manager. He stated he had heard from Directors initially that they would consider increasing the number of core goals and decide whether the goals should be better articulated.

Director Menten said she would not limit the discussion to an increase in core goals and said that the committee may decide to have more or fewer.

Ms. McManus stated that she had sent Director Menten two documents, the initial document previously used in the recruitment for the General Manager Position, which flowed into General Manager Genova’s initial contract, and another document that served as the original job description for the General Manager. She reiterated that the Board would need to look at changes sooner rather than later, because any substantial changes could prompt either General Manager Genova or the Board to make changes to the contract.

Chair Tisdale asked whether there could be some initial discussion in March.

Director Walker said that was what he was hearing.

Chair Tisdale said that such a discussion would be congruent with the general mission of the retreat.

Ms. McManus said yes and that both General Manager Genova and his predecessor, Phil Washington, felt that the General Manager should be evaluated in the same manner as the rest of the RTD employees. She stated that she would send out the list of core goals applicable to other employees.

Director Deadwyler stated other staff members’ goals were being achieved through goals written for the General Manager.

Chair Tisdale said that General Manager’s contract did say that he should be reviewed in same manner as other employees.

Director Walker noted the Board was fairly constrained in what it could do but said he welcomed the conversation.

Director Deadwyler said that, if the original core goals written for former General Manager Noel Busck were still in use, those goals should be revisited.

Ms. McManus said the core goals had not changed, which was why the evaluation criteria were consistent for some time.

Director Walker said that the Board changed the General Manager’s task goals, not the core goals, but added that nothing was written in stone.

Chair Tisdale said that the core goals should be re-examined each time the committee convenes. He said the committee could decide to get rid of the core goals entirely but noted that would be unlikely. He noted the committee could either increase or reduce the number of core goals

Director Menten said that, in her previous experience on the GM Oversight committee, the Directors had said that the core goals were set and nothing could be done to change them. She said she disagreed with that notion.

Director Walker said his recollection was that the committee could not change the core goals previously because of the timing of the changes.

Chair Tisdale added that the task of the GM Oversight Committee was to evaluate the General Manager’s performance for 2018, whereas the General Manager’s goals for 2019 would be set during the upcoming retreat.

Director Menten said that former Director Bagley had said previously that the General Manager, whether Mr. Washington or Mr. Genova, and the Board had agreed to a contract, and he felt that the Board could not change the terms of employment in middle of a contract.

Ms. McManus noted that the General Manager was in an option year on his contract.

Chair Tisdale said the question was whether the Board should exercise the General Manager’s option, renegotiate the contract, or part company.

Ms. McKillop noted the difference between core and task goals was that core were intended to be inherent skills or attributes required for someone to have at a given level of position, whereas task goals were individual job objectives set for each year. She said it was in the Board’s prerogative to change the goals and the agency would then reevaluate how those goals are interpreted. She added that the core goals were metrics to use when interviewing candidates.

Director Walker said that neither the Board nor the General Manager could change the contract unilaterally and that, while there was not a lot of wiggle room to change cores, there was no option for the Board to mandate a change to the contract. He said that the Board could renegotiate the contract with General Manager Genova if he wanted to do so.

Director Deadwyler asked the length of the contract.

Ms. McManus said the contract was for three years, plus two one-year options.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked Director Menten what she was considering in terms of adding or deleting core goals.

Director Menten said that one example would be the core goal criterion of providing service. She said that, in order to exceed expectations, the General Manager needed to meet only one targets, which she said was a weak objective.

Ms. McManus clarified that, in that example, Director Menten was not proposing a change in the core goals but rather the evaluative elements underneath them.

Director Menten agreed that might be the case. She said that she was looking at what the word “exceeded” meant and had argued that the criterion related to “being called to speak at a conference” was not in and of itself indicative of the General Manager exceeding expectations for his leadership. She said that the General Manager meeting individually with Directors would show his leadership.

Chair Tisdale summarized that the issue was more a reassessment of the General Manager’s evaluative criteria. He said that the committee retooled the evaluation format recently and that Director Menten was suggesting the focus of the evaluation, rather than the core goals themselves, could be revisited.

Director Menten agreed and said the titles of the evaluation criteria may need to be refreshed. She said that it had been nearly 15 years since the FasTracks initiative appeared on the ballot.

Chair Tisdale stated that such matters could be brought up during the March retreat and said ensuring that the goals are measurable would be part of the conversation moving forward.

Director Deadwyler said she appreciated Chair Tisdale’s comments. She stated she was on the GM Oversight Committee years ago and that the committee could not come to a conclusion on how to measure accomplishments, which was unfair to the General Manager.

Director Walker said that he did not share the same concern, because he stated that most of the measuring elements were fairly objective.

Chair Tisdale said that some of the criteria had changed since Director Deadwyler served on the GM Oversight Committee.

Director Walker agreed and said that the Directors would review the core goals and develop task goals at the March retreat, after which the General Manager would flesh out those goals and present them to the Board for approval.

Director Deadwyler again asked how the goals would be measured.

Director Lubow said that too would be discussed.

Chair Tisdale said that discussion would be part of the process.

Director Walker said the General Manager would determine how he and staff would meet the goals and that the Board would decide how the goals were measured.

Director Menten agreed and gave the 2017 Women’s March as an example of an empirical measure, since a certain number of attendees were expected and many more attended. She asked Ms. McKillop to provide an explanation of how the core goals flow down into the evaluation criteria and stated that she did not want to make the goals unattainable.

Ms. McManus said that the evaluative elements were simply plugged in. She said that making changes to the elements would be easy unless there were numerous changes.

Chair Tisdale said the framework was flexible enough to allow tweaks.

Ms. McManus said that one additional change from the previous year was that the evaluation survey would now reflect all of the specific evaluative elements.

Director Deadwyler discussed with former Director Francone how the elements of the survey were weighted in the survey.

Ms. McManus said the changes to the survey would mean that individual responses would carry a lot of weight.

Director Menten said she did not realize that the survey questions were not equally weighted.

Ms. McManus said the weighing was a function of the survey’s format. She said that, in reviewing the survey as a whole, there were specific comments that could not be incorporated into the overall evaluation.

Director Deadwyler suggested that was the reason some Directors did not complete their surveys.

Ms. McManus said that the survey could be easily contoured.

Chair Tisdale said he understood Director Walker’s intention to make the General Manager’s performance evaluation a collaborative process. He said he felt good about that and that each of the Directors would support him in that effort. He noted for the record that General Manager Genova had arrived in the room.

General Manager Genova said he did not have specific comments about the CPUC hearing to report and that he expected the hearing would conclude that day.

Chair Tisdale stated that former Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) official Clifford Eby had given good testimony describing the FRA process, the impact of waivers and what they represent, and how FRA deals with waivers.

Director Deadwyler asked when an answer would be rendered.

General Manager Genova said that the ALJ’s would draft his opinion within weeks and would then present his findings to the Commissioners. He said the written order would take about a month.

Director Lubow asked whether the ALJ’s findings would be made public.

General Manager Genova said that the findings would eventually be presented in a written order and that the ALJ’s preliminary findings would become a public document.

Chair Tisdale said RTD’s General Counsel would likely file comments on the ALJ’s findings.

General Manager Genova stated that the testimony was incredibly complex. He said that the previous witness had cleared up many of the questions about the design of the system.

Chair Tisdale said that the ALJ would meet with the Commissioners that day during a break in the hearing. He said there would be no closing arguments presented that day and that comments would be submitted later.

Director Lubow asked if the Directors could review the written closing statement.

General Manager Genova said yes and commented that no one in the audience was there in opposition. He said the proceeding was unusual in that the ALJ was only one asking questions.

Director Walker noted that he sent a draft schedule of the GM Oversight Committee calendar to Ms. McManus.

Ms. McManus said that she and Director Walker had spoken about the schedule earlier but noted that the timeframe would change as a result of the earlier conversation.

Director Walker said he would have something to report during the February 27, 2018, Board Meeting.

Director Folska, Ph.D. said that she wanted the committee to be cognizant that the agency may have to cut service and raise fares.

Chair Tisdale said that those were poignant issues. He said that Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security, and Asset Management, had given a sobering presentation that alerted us to the issues Director Folska addressed. He said the agency would have to look long and hard at what would happen to service as Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations conclude.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that, when considering what to do with fares, the agency should be cautious of combining service reductions with fare increases. She suggested that selling both service reductions and fare increases simultaneously would not sit well with constituents.

Director Menten agreed and said that the key word in her public meetings would be “efficiencies”. She said that in a given meeting with 60 constituents only a few typically used RTD’s services. She said those people did not like to hear about fare subsidies.

Director Deadwyler said that her constituents appreciated honesty and stated that, if the agency is in trouble, people want to hear the truth. She said she was asked at one of her public meetings why others at RTD were not as forthright.

Chair Tisdale continued to work on a resolution regarding FasTracks and that their focus was on the paragraph that explained what had happened.

Director Lubow said she felt strongly that it would not be a good time to raise fares if the agency decided to cut service.

Chair Tisdale noted that such matters were not on the day’s agenda and that there would be other opportunities to address them.

##### a. TOD Evaluation Guidelines Board Action

#### E. Recommended Changes to Special Event Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approve the following changes to Special Event services:

1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and

2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.

BACKGROUND

1.       RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and RockiesRide service began that same year.  The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games.  Over the years, service levels have been adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton park-n-Rides).  Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks games; most games operated with six buses.  In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of $20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.

Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board passengers.  In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer be available.  Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another location to the Rockies-Lot.  RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for the past 24 years.

Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.

2.       RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides.  Race for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006.  Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in 2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011.  In 2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers).  As Race for the Cure participation has declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.

It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service standards.

DISCUSSION

1.       RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of buses that can be used.  Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.

Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.  No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide service.

2.       RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place at one time.  The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.

Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and US-36 & McCaslin.  No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and US-85 & Bridge.

Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative Offices.  Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and email:

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

12:00 noon

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter.  There were six members from the public in attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments included the following:

- Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game

- Sports-rides should be better marketed

- Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L

- Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

6:00 pm

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade.  There were three members from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.

No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.

RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  Those comments are summarized below:

- Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide Service.

- Email (3):  Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was good and/or full.  A third email shared several comments:

o        Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and non-existent on Sundays

o        RTD does not market anything

o        RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on ridership

o        RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game

o        Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park Avenue

o        Fares should be collected in both directions

o        RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service

o        RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service

o        RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting services that people actually use

FINANCIAL IMPACT

1.       RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of service.

2.       RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:

1.              Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station.  This alternative is not recommended because on opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.

3.              Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent years.

#### F. Authorization to enter into a contract with DatamanUSA

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for an amount not to exceed $7,750,000 over 5 years.  Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
