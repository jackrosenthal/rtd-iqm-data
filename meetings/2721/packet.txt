Contract Amendment; 1st year (2018) option
2017-2019 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 37DM002

General

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised contract, which was
awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in April of 2017.
Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very good
contractor. The current base contract value and proposed amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
0.00
$ 371,409.75
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and first option year (2018) =
$ 861,282.25
DISCUSSION
This second amendment (1st year option) will increase the contract by $ 371,409.75, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $ 861,282.25.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $371,409.75 funding for this Board Action shall come from the 2018 Capital Programs Expense
Budgets that are within the approved budget.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.

ALTERNATIVES
Accept the Recommended Action.
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
Do Not Accept the Recommended Action.
Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) year of a three-year option contract for the
annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead
develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s construction work. This is not recommended
because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned 2018 street improvements
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2018 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 44
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 44 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $3,100,654.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted 2018 Task Goal #3, Asset Management and State of Good Repair, Bus
Operations has begun the process of replacing the aging and high maintenance Cutaway Buses,
currently being used for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Information for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula to the original price quotes results in a
per bus unit cost of $69,303.57 for a Call-n-Ride bus and $65,371.03 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace 322011 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the Call-n-Ride service and 12 2007 and 2011 Model Year
buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2007 and 2011 Model Year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 7 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them
in service.
The new ADA cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with
the disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The new Goshen cutaway buses will be up to 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an
extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for
the Call-n-Ride buses and three wheelchair access areas for the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA
compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security camera system per the current standard on
all new RTD buses.

Packet Pg. 6

2.11.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2018 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $3,100,654. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

Code of Ethics Approval

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 6, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors approve the
attached RTD Code of Ethics.
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors approved the current RTD Code of Ethics (Code) 15 years ago, on January 21,
2003. RTD’s current Code narrowly meets Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requirements that RTD
have a Board-approved code of ethics applicable to the Board as well as to RTD employees with
responsibility for procurement. However, while such a “procurement code of ethics” provides guidance
for Directors and a small subset of RTD employees, and protection for RTD in situations related to
contractual relationships, it fails to apply to the rest of RTD’s employees, and fails to provide Directors
and staff with broader, more basic ethical standards to which all RTD representatives should adhere.
RTD’s current Code has long caused confusion because while it is given to all RTD employees in
training, only a small subset of RTD employees are actually subject to its terms. The current Code also
needs updating to adhere to current legal requirements.
Staff provided a new, draft Code of Ethics to the Finance Administration & Audit Committee as an
informational item in January, seeking comments and suggestions. In response, Directors asked that the
Code specifically reference the concepts of impartiality and avoiding appearances of impropriety; and
make clear that the Code is a Board-adopted policy, while accompanying examples and explanatory
commentary are not policy but procedures. After providing several weeks for any additional comments
or requests, staff incorporated all Director’s suggestions into a new draft. Staff is now requesting
approval of the new Code of Ethics.
DISCUSSION
RTD decided that updating the RTD Code of Ethics was a valuable project to accomplish in the 2017
Leadership Academy. A Leadership Academy team of RTD represented and salaried employees - Raleigh
Elstun, Todd Keir, Corey Petzinger, and Karl Shoemaker – took on the task, sponsored and mentored by
RTD’s General Counsel and Pam Kachka in the Education, Training & Development Division.
The proposed new RTD Code of Ethics started as a clean sheet. The Leadership Academy team
collaborated, set goals, planned the work, and then worked their plan. The team identified current FTA
requirements and researched other transit agency Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit,
and SEPTA) for ideas and guidance.
The team and General Counsel ultimately decided to create a two-part Code of Ethics, with the main
part pertaining to all employees, and a smaller part with additional standards for Directors and employees
with fiduciary responsibilities. This arrangement was determined to be optimal for clarity, simplicity,
functionality, and general applicability for all employees.

Packet Pg. 8

2.11.C

Unlike the current Code, the new Code of Ethics is much shorter, far less technical in language, and
goes beyond procurement to express basic ethical standards applicable to all RTD representatives:
Integrity, Honesty, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Sustainability.
Instead of the current document in which examples and explanatory comments are part of the Boardapproved Code and can therefore only be updated or revised through formal Board action, the proposed
Code offloads such examples and comments into a separate procedural document. RTD’s General
Counsel will maintain and update that document under RTD’s standard methods for revising, publicizing
and maintaining procedures, following notification to and opportunity for comment by the Board and the
Senior Leadership Team. (In response to Committee comments in January, the new Code has been
revised to make clear that those procedures are not themselves policies.) This approach keeps the Boardapproved Code of Ethics clean and simple, and allows for regular updating of examples as necessary to
ensure that they stay relevant and address current concerns and questions.
The proposed new Code addresses changes in law since 2003, and applies monetary standards for gifts
based on those now applicable to other public employees under the Colorado Constitution (through the
ballot initiative Amendment 41).
The Leadership Academy team gave presentations and conducted interviews with many RTD
stakeholders including Safety, Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor Relations, Asset
Management, and RTD’s General Manager. The team also provided drafts to the Union for review and
comment. This outreach provided invaluable information and perspectives to aid the team to create the
most relevant and highest quality Code of Ethics possible. The new Code of Ethics submitted for
adoption by the Board of Directors is an original document that satisfies legal requirements as well as
major stakeholders’ wishes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no adverse financial impact to adopting the new Code of Ethics. There will be minor costs in
printing and distributing the new Code and obtaining approvals. RTD already conducts training
courses in ethics to new and other employees. RTD will educate employees on the Code of Ethics
and is planning to roll out training and education within RTD’s existing education and training
budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors approve
the attached RTD Code of Ethics Adopt the new Code of Ethics. This is the recommended
action.
2. Do not adopt the new Code of Ethics, and instead return the new Code to staff for further
revision. This is not recommended, as the new Code has already undergone substantial review
including incorporation of all comments received at and after last month’s Finance Administration
& Audit Committee meeting.

A.

Introduction

This RTD Code of Ethics provides mandatory standards and guidance on ethical behavior
and choices for all of us at RTD: our employees and directors. We will use this Code of Ethics to
guide our daily decisions and actions.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all all be alert to
potential ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct which
creates an appearance of impropriety. Those of us who supervise others must foster an
atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD policies and procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics
training and resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are
ever unsure whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for
a written advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team

consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of
comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on _______________, 2018.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that interfere with official
RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and responsibilities that
directly affect an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.1.1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions
which create an appearance of impropriety.
1.2.1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether
for ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.3.1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary
value to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.4.1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will be interested in any
contract or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative
capacity.
1.5.1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit
nor accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from
contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial
interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic
value. For purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial”
or of “nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado

Packet Pg. 13

2.11.C.a

Constitution Art. XXIX (Amendment 41). To confirm the current dollar limit, click

others, respect the diversity of the communities we serve, and promote a
work environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.
3.1. We will treat each other, our customers, contractors, partners, and members of
the public with respect.

C.

Contracts with Current and Former Employees

For RTD employees who have responsibility for procurements or who are engaged in the
award or administration of contracts, RTD is generally prohibited from entering into contracts
with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

1. Contracts with Current Employees
RTD will not enter into any transaction involving goods, services or
property with an RTD employee, or with a person or entity in which an
RTD employee has an interest.
RTD employees are considered to have an interest in transactions involving:
1. Any immediate family member (spouse or domestic partner, and their
parents, children, brothers and sisters)
2. Any person or entity with whom an RTD employee has an agreement to
receive (or reasonable expectation of receiving) any benefit
3. Any entity in which an employee is a director, officer, employee, prospective

employee, or shareholder
4. Any debtor of the employee
This section will not apply in the case of:
1. Remote interests: non-paid volunteers or officers of a nonprofit; less than
5% ownership of shares in a business; solely representative capacity such as
a receiver, trustee or administrator.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

2. An entity that is the only available source for essential goods, services or
property.
3. A financial institution holding RTD funds, or RTD borrowing funds from a
financial institution that offers the lowest available rate of interest for the
loan.
4. Emergency situations, provided that a record explaining the emergency
situation is prepared by the General Manager and submitted to the Board of
Directors at its next regular meeting.
5. Contracts entered into with full disclosure and knowledge of the conflict, and
approval of the contract, by the Board of Directors.
Any such exceptions must be fully disclosed and documented in the contract file.

2. Contracts with Former Employees
RTD will not contract with, or take any act favorably affecting, any person,
or any entity represented by a person, who has within the preceding one
year been an employee of RTD.
This section is to be applied so that if a former employee was involved in the
contract or would have had influence over decisions related to the contract, that
person cannot now benefit from the contract.
This sections does not apply to employment of retirees or temporary adjunct
employment under standard policies approved by RTD’s Human Resources Division.
This section will not apply in cases where a contract involving a current employee
would be exempted. Any such exceptions must be fully disclosed and documented in
the contract file.

D.

Annual Disclosure

Employees in positions determined by RTD to be responsible for
procurements or engaged in the award or administration of contracts must
complete and submit to the General Counsel an interest disclosure form subject to
procedures approved by the Senior Leadership Team.

E.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

The disclosure form is kept confidential and is used to create a general, nonpersonalized list of those persons or entities with whom RTD may be restricted from doing
business. No financial data is required. Proposed transactions are compared with the list to see
if there are relationships that could cause a conflict of interest, in which case the General
Counsel and Senior Manager of Materials Management will consult.

Advice, Enforcement, and Penalties for Violation

If you are unsure as to whether an action may violate this Code of Ethics, you should
first consult the comments and examples in RTD’s official policies and procedures, and then
contact RTD’s General Counsel if you still have questions. If you are ever unsure whether

A.

Introduction

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct that creates an
appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person. Those of us who supervise others must
foster an atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics training and
resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are ever unsure
whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for a written
advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team

consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of
comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on February 27, 2018.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that unduly interfere with
official RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and
responsibilities that directly impact an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions that create
an appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person.
1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether for
ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary value
to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will have an interest in any
contract or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative
capacity.
1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit nor
accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial interest is
not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. For
purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial” or of
“nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado

others, respect the diversity of the communities we serve, and promote a
work environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.
3.1. We will treat each other, our customers, contractors, partners, and members of
the public with respect.
3.2. We will not unlawfully harass or discriminate against other employees, our
customers, contractors, partners, and members of the public.

decision making, consistent with laws and rules protecting confidentiality
of certain information.

Contracts with Current and Former Employees

For RTD employees who have responsibility for procurements or who are engaged in the
award or administration of contracts, RTD is generally prohibited from entering into contracts
with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

1. Contracts with Current Employees
RTD will not enter into any transaction involving goods, services or
property with an RTD employee, or with a person or entity in which an
RTD employee has an interest.

Date:

Subject:

Transit Oriented Development Evaluation
Guidelines

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number
(the “Resolution”), the “Transit Oriented
Development Evaluation Guidelines” to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating transit
oriented development (TOD) projects moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has invested over $5.8 billion dollars in the rapid transit network for the Denver Metropolitan
Region since 2004. A direct result of this investment and previous rapid transit investments by RTD is a
tremendous level of interest in TOD at or adjacent to stations along RTD’s rapid transit network. In
2016, the Board initiated RTD TOD Assessment was completed by outside consultants. The final report
for the TOD Assessment indicated that RTD would benefit from “achieving mission clarity” on TOD by
more clearly defining the value of TOD for the agency.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s current policy guidance for TOD, including the Strategic Plan for TOD (2010), provides limited
guidance on how RTD should access the value of TOD for the agency. Policy issues related to fiscal
sustainability, social equity, and safety and security are not clearly articulated in the Strategic Plan for
TOD and other policy documents. Clear direction on how to evaluate these policy issues would provide
more transparency and clarity in decision making for TOD projects for both internal staff and outside
stakeholders including local jurisdictions and developers.
It would therefore be beneficial to have TOD evaluation guidelines to provide a clearer direction to RTD
staff and external stakeholders on TOD projects. Draft TOD Evaluation Guidelines were presented at the
December 5th Planning, Capital Programs, and FasTracks Committee meeting. Board feedback on the
draft guidelines was provided at the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to TOD projects.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the attached Resolution Number
_
(the “Resolution”), the Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) Evaluation Guidelines, that is recommended by the Planning, Capital
Programs and FasTracks Committee, to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating TOD
projects moving forward.

2. Do not adopt resolution. Continue to operate with limited policy guidance and allow for
continued inconsistency with decision making on the value of TOD projects to RTD.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2018
(Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines)
A RESOLUTION PROVIDING POLICY GUIDANCE ON EVALUATING THE VALUE OF
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT TO THE RTD.
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District plans, designs, builds and operates mass
transit for the Denver region; and
WHEREAS, the provision of transit service to the Denver region by RTD influences
development patterns and supports transit oriented development; and
WHEREAS, decisions on transit oriented development at RTD are governed by RTD
statutes and a broad set of internal policies including RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010),
Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property (RTD Resolution 15, Series
of 2015), Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property (RTD Resolution 16, Series of
2015), and Parking Guiding Principles (Resolution 24, Series of 2016).
WHEREAS, RTD staff would benefit from additional policy guidance from the RTD Board of
Directors on evaluating TOD projects.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT TO ADOPT THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION GUIDELINES
FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:
TOD Evaluation Guidelines
A transit-oriented development (TOD) project occurring on or adjacent to RTD property will
inevitably affect RTD. When RTD is in a position to influence the TOD project, either by
entering into an agreement with the developer or jurisdiction, or through regulatory means,
and a decision is required regarding RTD’s participation, RTD must consider the value of
the TOD project to RTD.
The principles and evaluation factors below were developed to guide RTD staff’s
assessment of the TOD project’s value. As every TOD project is unique, each one will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to its total impact (positive or negative) to
RTD.
TOD Value Principles
The following principles set clear standards and thresholds for new TOD projects. Every
new TOD project is expected to satisfy all six principles.

Packet Pg. 36

2.12.D

1. The TOD project must be budget neutral or budget positive for RTD.
Evaluations of budget impact should take into account direct revenue to RTD,
including property sale or lease revenue, increased fare revenue, or other revenue
sources. Replacement, major rehabilitation, maintenance, administrative, and other
operational costs, as well as any capital expenditures, should be considered over
the long and short terms.
2. The TOD project must be expected to increase ridership.
The proposer must demonstrate that ridership is reasonably projected to increase as
a result of project implementation including having ridership projections reviewed
and approved by RTD staff. Ridership increases over the short and long-term will
be considered, but short term increases are preferred.
3. Where feasible, ground leases of RTD property are preferred over sales.
RTD prefers to retain a fee interest in property. In some cases, such as condo
development or an unfavorable economy, a ground lease may not be feasible, and a
land sale should be considered. In cases where a sale is considered, RTD should
take such actions that will preserve RTD’s long term interest.
4. The TOD project must reflect the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP).
RTD will evaluate third-party parking operations and parking replacement based on
the factors described in the PGP or such other relevant guidance provided by the
Board.
5. The TOD project must enhance safety and security.
The TOD project must positively contribute to the safety and security of the RTD
system by remedying any known problems at the site, as well as by addressing
issues of pedestrian safety and walkability, and by increasing “eyes on the street”
through activation.
6. The TOD project must have jurisdiction support.
The TOD project must be consistent with the local jurisdiction’s plans and the
jurisdiction, formally or informally, must demonstrate support for the project.
Evaluation Factors
TOD projects will additionally be measured against the following evaluation factors. Unlike
the TOD Value Principles, the evaluation factors should be considered as whole, with the
understanding that TOD projects may not satisfy all evaluation factors. In determining the
total impact of a TOD project to RTD, Tier One Factors should be given more weight than
Tier Two Factors.
Tier One Factors:
 Ground Lease/Land Sale
Revenue from a land sale or ground lease should support RTD’s fiscal sustainability.


Increased Ridership/Fare Revenues
Generating new ridership supports RTD’s mission and directly benefits RTD through
increased fare revenues.

Packet Pg. 37

2.12.D



Replacement or New Facilities
Leveraging development to provide new or replacement facilities that are needed for
transit operations supports a state of good repair as determined by RTD (the value
of the facility may be large, such as for a new parking structure, or small, such as
for a Driver Relief Station).



Outsourced Maintenance
Assigning maintenance responsibilities, such as landscaping, cleaning, general
maintenance, snow and ice removal, and graffiti removal, to a third party in a
manner that is consistent with RTD standards and does not increase RTD’s
administrative burden reduces costs and risks for RTD.



Jurisdiction Support
Jurisdiction support for a TOD project beyond basic planning demonstrates the
importance of the project to the local community. Demonstrations of strong
jurisdiction support might include updating zoning, providing financial support,
employing Tax Increment Financing (TIF), contributing to capital projects that
support the TOD project, or assuming part of the TOD project’s risk.



Enhanced RTD Operations
Improved transit operations through more efficient routing, more optimal transfers,
or other operational efficiencies directly benefit RTD.

Tier Two Factors:


Improved Safety/Security
Addressing safety and security issues such as emergency ingress and egress,
fire/life/safety communication, lighting and tripping hazards will positively impact
RTD. The activation of previously isolated stations also positively impacts security.



Upgraded Rider Amenities/Access
Upgraded rider amenities or increased options or access to RTD transit improve the
rider experience and may include improved seating, vending, walkways, open
space, wayfinding, and First Mile/Last Mile solutions.



Community Facilities/Affordable Housing
RTD supports and benefits from community facilities and/or affordable housing at
TOD projects that are consistent with local jurisdiction policies.



Brand Image Enhancement
RTD’s brand is enhanced and RTD benefits as a whole when RTD is positively
associated with a TOD project that supports community objectives.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 8, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 8, 2018

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

Subject:

Recommended
Services

Changes

to

Special

Event

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the following changes to Special Event services:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and
2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.
BACKGROUND
1. RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and
RockiesRide service began that same year. The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides
and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games. Over the years, service levels have been
adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four
Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton parkn-Rides). Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks
games; most games operated with six buses. In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per
game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service
operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for
BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of
$20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet
been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.
Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the
parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board
passengers. In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer
be available. Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another
location to the Rockies-Lot. RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for
the past 24 years.
Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies
games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north
metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded
sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service
configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve
the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.
2. RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on

Packet Pg. 44

2.12.E

October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides. Race
for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006. Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in
2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011. In
2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an
all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers). As Race for the Cure participation has
declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.
It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be
discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service
standards.
DISCUSSION
1. RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between
Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After
looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of
buses that can be used. Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain
clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a
minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for
special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent
attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at
Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.
Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.
No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize
staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies
game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide
service.
2. RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place
at one time. The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD
service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.
Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and
US-36 & McCaslin. No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and
US-85 & Bridge.
Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative
Offices. Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and
email:

12:00 noon
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter. There were six members from the public in
attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments
included the following:
 Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game
 Sports-rides should be better marketed
 Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.
Monday, February 5, 2018
RTD Administrative Offices
6:00 pm
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade. There were three members
from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service
changes. None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.
No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.
RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.
Those comments are summarized below:
 Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide
Service.
 Email (3): Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was
good and/or full. A third email shared several comments:
o Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and nonexistent on Sundays
o RTD does not market anything
o RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on
ridership
o RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union
Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game
o Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park
Avenue
o Fares should be collected in both directions
o RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service
o RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service
o RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting
services that people actually use
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this
funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of
service.
2. RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD
RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

Packet Pg. 46

2.12.E

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station. This alternative is not recommended because on
opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the
service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In
addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.
3.

Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended
as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent
years.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

Subject:

Authorization to enter into a contract with
DatamanUSA

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 6, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for an amount not to exceed
$7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these
Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
BACKGROUND
RTD has need of an on-call contractor to provide support and enhancement of the functional and
technical capabilities within Oracle E-Business Suite – and planning and implementing the next logical
upgrade/alternatives of products and tools. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods
addressing business, management of technology and consultant services. The activities are inclusive of all
activities necessary to support, enhance and update the Oracle Products and tools.
RTD has utilized an on-call contract of this nature for Oracle support for more than 10 years. During the
previous 5-year contract period, RTD spent a total of approximately $2.1 million on projects such as state
of good repair, business intelligence configuration and implementation, real time reporting, Oracle
advanced benefits assessment, open enrollment changes and updates, and Oracle hardware upgrades and
enhancements.
RTD anticipates the upcoming 5-year contract period may include work associated with several new
implementations including Inventory Planning, Contract Management, Budgeting, Human Capital
Management, Finance and Accounting, Enterprise Planning, and other ancillary systems. RTD will also use
this contract to assist in maintaining day-to-day operations of the existing Oracle system while the new
systems are being implemented. Other projects that may utilize work order assistance include real time
enhancements, business intelligence enhancements, open enrollment updates, Oracle hardware
configurations and upgrades, and system security enhancements.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for an ERP Work Order contractor. Six firms submitted proposals.
The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected two firms for interviews. DatamanUSA was selected
as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $7,750,000 (including contingency). Funding for these Work
Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed. The types of
funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project. Individual work orders will be
funded as the project requirement is processed. The amount is not to exceed $1,950,000.00 (including
contingency) in any one year.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for
an amount not to exceed $7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed,
work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects
on which the work is performed.
2. Provide the needed services with RTD personnel. RTD personnel does not have the expertise or
capacity that can be provided by a work order contractor. This does not meet the needs of
RTD.
3. Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over six
months and not likely result in an improved outcome.
