### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Local Update - CRL & Associates

Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, said that his report in the Board packet covered the discussions surrounding the legislative transportation sales tax. He said that the Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) and a separate coalition working on the issue would come to decisions that week, and he anticipated that ballot titles would be filed as well. He highlighted the upcoming Colorado Counties, Inc. (CCI) and Colorado Municipal League (CML) conferences and said that the Board would find the conferences to be beneficial. He added that CRL Associates would host a dinner during the CML conference.

Director Lubow said that Mr. Sherman’s report spoke about a letter from MMC and asked for clarification on what MMC was requesting.

Mr. Sherman replied that the coalition had agreed to a distribution formula of 45% for the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), 15% for a new multimodal fund, and 40% split evenly between cities and counties. He said MMC wanted to request a $.01 tax in the ballot measure, though he noted there was some opposition from the rest of the state. He stated that, if the tax rate in the proposal came in less than $.01, MMC wanted to reduce the amount that would go to CDOT to 35% in order to maintain the level of funding to local jurisdictions. He said that MMC requested that proportional changes be made if the proposed tax is set at $.005 or $.0062, which was the rate proposed in House Bill 17-1242.

Director Lubow asked Mr. Sherman to explain the sales tax distribution chart to her offline.

Director Menten asked whether the ballot measure would only result in statutory changes, and Mr. Sherman responded that was correct.

#### 2. State Update - Brandeberry McKenna

Julie McKenna, Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK), said that Senator Bob Gardner and Representative K.C. Becker had introduced Senate Bill 18-088 (SB088), which aimed to correct the drafting error in Senate Bill 17-267, which eliminated the ability of the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD), RTD, and other special districts to collect taxes on marijuana sales. She said the House Finance Committee heard the bill the previous day and that it would be heard on the House floor that week, where it would wrap up quickly. She said that state legislators were also working on their own transportation measures while the ballot questions were being ironed out. Specifically, she said that Senate Bill 18-001 (SB001), regarding transportation bonds, centered on bonding using state general fund dollars. She said that SB001 was the main legislative vehicle at the time but said there would be others.

Megan Wagner, BBMK, said there was a stakeholder group looking at a bill to create a true one call system. She said that BBMK was participating in those conversations to make sure that RTD’s concerns would be addressed. She said the bill would likely be introduced the following day.

Director Lubow asked how well SB088 was passing through the legislative process.

Ms. McKenna responded that everything was going very well. She said that, following the special legislative session in 2017, the direction was to formulate a solution in a different way. She added that SB088 had 18 Senate and 33 House cosponsors, enough votes to ensure its passage.

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs (SPB) said that the federal government was operating under a continuing resolution (CR) and stated the House had recently passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through March 23, 2018. He noted that the House version of the resolution fully funded the Department of Defense (DoD). He added that the Senate was closing in on a deal that would fund the federal government for the following two fiscal years, though he noted the vote on that legislation would not take place before the expiration of the existing CR on Thursday, February 8, 2018. He said that the Senate would likely remove the additional DoD funding authorized by the House. He noted that the President had stated that he would not sign any funding legislation that did not deal with immigration and was comfortable with the federal government entering another shutdown. He said the House and Senate could agree to another six-week CR extension. Mr. Dino stated that SPB’s report covered the pending infrastructure plan, which he said the White House planned to release on February 12, 2018. He said there were questions about long-term transportation funding and noted that, in the GOP retreat the previous week, House Transportation Committee Chair Bill Shuster stated his interest increasing the balance of the Highway Trust Fund. He said Rep. Shuster identified a raise in the gas tax as a way of achieving that.

Director Folska asked whether the current federal excise tax on gasoline was still $.185 cents per gallon.

Mr. Dino stated that he thought that was correct.

Director Folska said that it should be easy for Congress to raise that tax, because Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell had been able to do so even with a state legislature controlled by Republicans. She asked by how much Rep. Shuster intended to raise the tax.

Mr. Dino said that the proposal was not specific and noted that a portion of the House Republican caucus would not listen to the proposal. He said he was not sure how much traction the proposal would receive.

Director Archuleta asked whether there was any validity in the President’s announcement during the recent State of the Union Address that he intended to put $1.3 trillion into infrastructure.

Mr. Dino said that the President wanted to put the onus on local and state governments to come up with the seed money. He said that RTD, for example, was able to win a full funding grant agreement (FFGA) because the agency committed 50% of the funding for the project, whereas most contemporaneous state and local projects offered only 20%, which made RTD more competitive. He said the President indicated that state and local project would have to commit to 80% of the funding for a project, while the federal government would supply the remaining. He said that such a financing structure was a heavy lift for state and local projects but said that, in some ways, that was the reality for the transportation industry.

### D. Other Matters

Director Menten mentioned that one of RTD’s properties was located next to the Federal Center Station. She said that 59 acres of federal land would soon be auctioned off by the federal government and that, pursuant to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, agencies that provide assistance to homeless populations had first rights to auctioned federal land. She noted that a portion of the land was contaminated because of its prior use as a federal munitions plant. She said that the auction was held up in the courts at that time but said that 500-600 units of transitional housing would potentially be erected on the site. She said that quite a few local elected officials were not happy with the situation. She asked that staff contact her offline to explain RTD’s posture with regard to its property in that location.

General Manager Genova asked whether Director Menten was referring to the land previous used for the Cold Spring Park-n-Ride, and Director Menten said yes. General Manager Genova said that he would follow up with staff.

Director Menten added that the housing assistance agencies would not initially have the money to build typical housing structures and that they had described building something akin to igloos instead. She said that it may be some time before there would be enough money to build permanent structures on the site.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Solano adjourned the meeting at 5:51 p.m.
