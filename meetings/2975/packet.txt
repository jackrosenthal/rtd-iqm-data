2020 - 2022 Granite Paver Maintenance
Contract for 16th Street Mall Transitway Lanes

General

Board Meeting Date: February 6, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his or her designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute
the three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation, in the dollar amount of $3,565,821. Funding for the first year of this action is $1,100,000
and is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget.
This recommendation supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
BACKGROUND
The Free Mall Ride bus service connects Denver Union Station and Civic Center Plaza, and carried
approximately 32,000 passengers per weekday in 2019 on the 16th Street in Downtown Denver
(“Mall”). A portion of the Mall, from Civic Center Plaza to Market Street was built in 1982 with granite
pavers as the surfacing materials. The right-of-way is owned by the City and County of Denver (CCD),
but RTD took on the maintenance of the Transitway pavers in 1984. Under the terms of an existing
inter-governmental agreement (IGA), RTD is required to provide maintenance on the Transitway pavers
until December 31, 2022.
From 2017 through 2019, RTD spent $3,289,549 in direct costs for repairing the Transitway pavers.
Repairing the pavers also includes part time effort of several staff members in addition to the direct cost.
In 2013, CCD committed to participate in the cost of granite paver maintenance and pay RTD 30% of
the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an annual maximum of $300,000, for a period of ten years.
In 2015 and 2016, RTD staff led an environmental clearance effort to evaluate different paving material
alternatives for the Transitway. In 2017, a broader vision for the Mall came under consideration, to
make the Mall a place to go to, in addition to going though. The Downtown Denver Partnership and
CCD are working to make the Mall a destination and a welcoming place for everyone in the heart of a
vibrant downtown. As part of realizing the vision, the transit lanes will be moved towards the center,
and the Mall will be rebuilt with granite paving in a manner that addresses historic problems, such as the
slippery surface, and inadequate drainage, and enhances public life.
Release of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the reconstruction project for public review, and the
framework for construction and maintenance agreements was approved by the RTD Board on June 26,
2018. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was issued by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) on November 26, 2019, thus completing the EA process. RTD is committing the federal funds
from two FTA grants previously awarded to RTD for rehabilitation of the Transitway (provided that FTA

Packet Pg. 5

2.11.A

approves changes to the scope of those grants), as well as RTD’s 1/3 share of the Local Match to the
grants. The remaining funds for these two grants total $14,802,501, and require a 20% local match.
CCD is proceeding with developing plans, specifications, and a Request for Proposals. CCD intends to
obtain a five year warranty for the transit way from the contractor building the Project. RTD will make
payments of $100,000 each year during the warranty period in to a reserve account and 30% of
incurred maintenance costs thereafter, up to $100,000 per year.
The earliest ground disturbance expected is in the first half of 2021. Construction is expected to last at
least three years.
The construction and maintenance IGAs will need Denver City Council approval.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. The contract was advertised as a Request for
Proposals (RFP), or best value contract. Proposals were evaluated on Experience of the Firm and Key
Individuals (25%), Understanding/Approach/Organization (25%), and Cost (50%). Colorado Custom
Rock Corporation was deemed responsive and responsible and found to be the best value proposal.
Granite pavers are purchased by RTD on a separate contract with Cold Spring Granite and furnished to
the mall paver maintenance contractor for installation.
The best value proposer is Colorado Custom Rock Corporation for the three-year contract amount of
$3,565,821. The only other firm to propose was PCL Construction with a three year cost of
$6,412,012.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2020 Adopted Budget includes $1,100,000 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the remaining two years of the contract will be included in the 2021-2026 Mid-Term Financial Plan.
This Project is funded from local dollars, including the $300,000 annual contribution from the City and
County of Denver.
This is a work order contract, so the actual expenditures will vary depending on the amount of repair
work needed over the term of the contract. These expenditures will decrease after the Mall
reconstruction project begins.
DBE/SBE GOAL
The Small Business Office reviewed the scope of work, and established a zero percent SBE goal, due to
the specialized work involved. Colorado Custom Rock is an SBE firm.
ALTERNATIVES
1 Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his or her
designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the three-year contract for 16th Street
Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock Corporation, in the dollar amount of
$ $3,565,821. Funding for the first year of this action is $1,100,000 and is included in the 2020
Adopted Budget.
2

Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the Transitway pavers to fall into disrepair, which
may lead to trip hazards for pedestrians, and potentially cause damage to the buses. This will

Packet Pg. 6

2.11.A

lead RTD to reroute or discontinue the Free Mall Ride bus service and also violate terms of the
IGA with the CCD.
3

Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as historically we have only had a couple of firms
bid on this work.

Budget Transfer for Platte Boiler Replacement

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Finance, Audit, & Administration Committee that the Board of Directors
approve a budget transfer of $453,182 from the GM Contingency Fund to the Facilities budget to
fund the replacement of a boiler and 3 flues at Platte.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
The Platte shops has three boilers servicing the facility. They were replaced in 2014. Scope included
three new boilers and flues. Issues have risen with the boilers. RTD has filed a claim with our insurance
carrier for $278,182 for boiler #1.
We have a $100,000 deductible and have just received
$146,066.70. The insurance carrier is retaining $32,115.30 until the work on boiler #1 has been
completed. We are in the process of filing a claim with our insurance provider for boiler #2. We will be
pursing action against Legacy Mechanical, the installer, and Unilux Boiler, the manufacturer, to recover
our insurance deductible. We are currently evaluating the other boiler.
DISCUSSION
Shortly after installation it was determined that condensation from the three flues were becoming a
problem. Investigation took place to confirm that the new flues were deficient. RTD contacted the
manufacturer to inspect all three boilers. During inspection the manufacturer discovered that boiler #1
had a deformed housing or outer shell. The Risk Management Division was contacted to pursue claims
for the three flues and the damaged housing on boiler #1. An outsourced attorney and forensic
consultant have supplemented RTD’s investigation team. RTD has competitively contracted with
Rasmussen to replace boiler #1 and the three flues. Rasmussen was also contracted to tune up boiler #2
and boiler #3 as the firing was discovered to be excessive. Boiler #2 also failed while running on diesel
fuel. These boilers are designed as duel-fueled units. Boiler #2 also needs to be replaced which is why
additional funds for a second removal is required. A leaky valve is the suspected cause of the failure of
boiler #1 and boiler #2. We are only running on natural gas at this time. Funds being requested for
transfer will allow the project to move forward while the insurance claim is being processed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The GM contingency fund was set up to handle emergency situations such as this. This is an immediate
impact of $453,182. When the funds are received they will be returned to the GM contingency fund.

Packet Pg. 19

2.11.B

ALTERNATIVES
Recommended Action: It is recommended that the Finance, Audit, & Administration Committee
that the Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $453,182 from the GM Contingency
Fund to the Facilities budget to fund the replacement of a boiler and 3 flues at Platte.
Alternative #1: Don’t approve the request. This is not the recommended action as we would
have to wait for an extended period of time before funds would become available from insurance
and the boiler needs to be replaced/ repaired now.

Subject:

Longmont Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his/her designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically, the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326
and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County and the City of Longmont have funded and managed the Longmont fare buy-up program
since 2014. RTD and Boulder County entered into this agreement in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the
300 series routes in Longmont with the objective of building ridership and increase mobility options for
low income riders. During 2013, annual boardings for the Longmont local routes were 156,863
boardings (Weekday and Saturdays). By the end of 2018, boardings increased to 613,280.
The City of Longmont has since taken over the funding and management of this agreement and would
like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for a period of two additional years. This contract
would be in effect January 2020 through December 2021.
DISCUSSION
Under this agreement, all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting one and all passengers will be required to
adhere to all RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct. This agreement will not include the FlexRide
or regional routes operating within Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont will continue to
perform the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of the RTD
Marketing Department. RTD staff will also continue to conduct regular meetings with the local
municipalities to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with this agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
During this 24-month agreement, the City of Longmont has agreed to pay RTD the projected fares in the
amount of $972,402. In addition, the city has agreed to reimburse the RTD fares for all Access-a-Ride
trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. The City and RTD have
agreed on a methodology to calculate the cost of the program to the city based on ridership in arrears.
There will be a termination clause in the contract that will allow either the City or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his/her designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of
the Longmont local fixed route services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically, the
300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a
period of two years.
2. Do not approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up. This course
of action is not recommended, as it will result in a loss of a program valuable to the City of
Longmont and Boulder County. Additionally, this program provides transportation access to the
low-income population in these area. Local ridership will be reduced as customers are charged a
fare and lose the ability to travel for free at any time.

Check Register Publication

Date: February 5, 2020

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Menten, Mihalik, Lubow, Lewis, Williams, and Folska at the February 11,
2020 Financial Administration and Audit Committee, that the RTD Board of Directors instruct the Interim
General Manager/Chief Financial Officer to take all necessary steps to deploy the RTD Financial
Transparency Check Register at our website. This portal shall include a downloadable comma or text
delimited file which includes payee, date, check number or electronic funds transfer (EFT), invoice
number (if available), purchase order number (if available), cost center account code, object account
code, and description of purpose for the purchase. The data file shall contain only information that is a
public record or that is not confidential or otherwise protected from public disclosure pursuant to state or
federal law.
In addition, the chart of accounts shall be published listing cost center and object code, this file shall
also be available for download in comma or text delimited format.
The account payable check register shall be published and accessible to the public by July 1, 2020. The
downloadable file shall be updated monthly and contain the last three years of payments.
This recommended action supports the following Agency/General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 Strengthen transparent public communication
Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District Board of Directors at their March 2019 retreat endorsed a 2020
strategic goal to strengthen transparency and communication. Easier access to and storage of electronic
financial data should facilitate increased transparency in Regional Transportation District financial and
budget matters.
This policy directs staff to publish a downloadable comma or text delimited file on our public website
which shall include all public account payable line items including payee, date, check number or
electronic funds transfer (EFT), invoice number (if available), purchase order number (if available), cost
center account code, object account code, and description of the purpose. The data file shall contain
only information that is a public record or that is not confidential or otherwise protected from public
disclosure pursuant to state or federal law.

Packet Pg. 23

2.12.D

In addition, the chart of accounts shall be published listing cost center and object code, this file shall
also be available for download in comma or text delimited format.
This account payable register shall be published and accessible to the public by July 1, 2020. The online
accounts payable file shall be updated monthly and contain the last three years of payments.
DISCUSSION
Currently, the Regional Transportation District publishes a monthly PDF check register which includes
date, payee, and amount. The monthly PDF format makes it difficult to compare month-to-month
expenditures and does not include description, cost center, or object code. Over the last decade, many
public agencies have expanded their financial transparency and provide a searchable and/or
downloadable accounts payable file. These examples include the State of Colorado, Jefferson County,
City and County of Denver, City of Boulder, Adams County, City of Northglenn, West Metro Fire, City of
Lakewood and City of Fort Collins are some examples. In an effort to create expanded transparency,
public agencies have invested various levels of public funds. In light of RTD's financial challenges, this
proposal requires minimal investment but greatly needed transparency in an agency that is facing
tremendous public scrutiny. The required data points including payee, date, amount, invoice number,
purchase order ID, cost center, object code, and description are currently available in Oracle. The most
simple and least expensive method is to offer a downloadable file which provides ability to search,
tabulate, and filter.
In November 2019, the Chief Financial Officer indicated the agency will be challenged to pay for
operations and maintenance on the current service. Enhanced financial transparency allows the public
better insight into the financial operations of the Regional Transportation District.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Minimal – uses existing Oracle financial software and commonly available file format.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve recommendation to expand transparency in the Regional Transportation District.
2. Do not approve of expanded financial transparency and continue to publish monthly PDF without
useful detail.

RTD’s existing 5000 series Gillig 40 foot transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years
or 500,000 miles. The buses are 14 years old and have on average over 600,000 miles of stop and go
transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
This requested bus purchase is included in the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan.
On September 24, 2019 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 46 Gillig 40’ buses to
begin the replacement of the 5000 series Gillig buses. The original procurement was the result of RTD
Request for Proposal (RFP) 19FK002. Contract 19FK002 allows RTD options to purchase up to 204 40’
buses during the 5 year contract period. Pricing for option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus
an inflationary price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index”
(PPI) which is published monthly.
DISCUSSION
The 40 foot low floor buses are similar to those currently utilized at RTD with a proven seating layout
that is approved by the CCDC to maximize wheelchair passenger space. The buses are equipped with
clean diesel engines meeting the latest EPA requirements. Over the estimated lifetime of each bus,
emissions will be reduced by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases, 6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides (NO x) and
0.25 tons of Particulate Matter versus the engines in the current 2005 buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract is for the purchase of thirty-four (34) 40 foot transit buses, associated spare
components, and selected extended warranties not to exceed $16,650,480. Funding for this contract is
approved and available in the District’s 2020 Budget.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval. Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s
approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or
his/her designee, to exercise the contract option and amend contract 19FK002 with Gillig LLC for
the purchase of thirty-four (34) additional new 40 foot transit buses and associated spare
components, and extended warranties for a total price not to exceed $16,650,480.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it
would result, at the very least, in a significant delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase
the cost of the project. This will result in an increase in ongoing maintenance costs.
