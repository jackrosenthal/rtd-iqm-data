Executive Committee
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: To order, February 13, 11:37 PM. And if we could just-LYNN GUISSINGER: AM?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Pardon?
LYNN GUISSINGER: AM?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Did I say PM?
[LAUGHTER]
AM, thank you. [LAUGHS] And so we'll go around the room, and then introduce ourselves, and
then the folks on the phone. Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Chair and District C.
PEGGY CATLIN: Peggy Catlin, First Vice Chair and District N.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lynn Guissinger, Treasurer.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Heather McKillop.
SHELLEY COOK: Shelley Cook, District L.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Barbara McManus, Executive Manager, Board of Directors.
[BEEPING]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And who's on the phone, please?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Who's on the phone? It was Doug.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, Director Tisdale.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: It sounds somebody accidentally-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: He might have gotten off. Is there anyone else on the phone? WellLYNN GUISSINGER: We'll see if he comes back.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Well, the first thing is looking at the draft Board agenda. Can
I have a motion to adopt this.
[BEEP]
PEGGY CATLIN: Is somebody on the phone?
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Yes, sorry. It's Doug Tisdale again.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. With-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Before your docket, can ask you a question?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Sure.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Do you mind? I thought we were going to add a bullet item under the
old business about-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: North Metro?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We are.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, sorry.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Wait, I just need to look at it for a minute-- I haven't even looked
at it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: We're going to be short four directors, correct? I'm just-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: I didn't see anything that looked like it might-LYNN GUISSINGER: Do we know who they are?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, Catlin, Broom-PEGGY CATLIN: Williams.

BARBARA MCMANUS: --Williams and Whitmore.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry. Yeah, you guys won't be there.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Those guys won't be there.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's also the evening, isn't it, for the retirees that we didn't have?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
So I think there's two retirees that were not recognized last month that are coming to have dinner
with, minimally, the Executive Committee, hopefully, the rest of the Board, prior to the meeting
on the 25th. So we would like at least this-LYNN GUISSINGER: Just the regular 5 o'clock time?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. And it would be here. They would join us here.
PEGGY CATLIN: For the record, can we indicate the reason why the directors are not in
attendance?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Because of their public meetings in their districts?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mm-hmm. Yeah, absolutely.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And it's a study se-- no?
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, it's a board meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's a board meeting.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: When's the study session?
BARBARA MCMANUS: The study session is supposed to be next Tuesday, but we're canceling
it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, we are?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah-BARBARA MCMANUS: --and so-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --but they have lots of other things to work on.
[LAUGHTER]
BARBARA MCMANUS: We're also-- the Board office has been putting together a special
recognition for Rolf, who will be here-LYNN GUISSINGER: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --to get his retiree plaque in March, at the board meeting in March.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So just so you know that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then-LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you for doing that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yup, no worries.
PEGGY CATLIN: (WHISPERING) Would you ask Doug to put his phone on mute?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale, could you put your phone on mute, please?
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): I apologize.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
--recognition. And then, for the gentlemen who are retiring that we're honoring in February on the
25th, we have a plaque for them? And-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, and we'll do all of that. So, if you recall, they all left because
we had been in meetings for so long. So we did write an official apology letter and invited them
to dinner. I'm really glad they're coming.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. Thank you, Angie, that was nice.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mm-hmm.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thanks for doing that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, cool. So the only other thing on this agenda that will be added
is underneath old business there will be a bullet point, and it will say N Line update-LYNN GUISSINGER: N Line update.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And we're going to continue that so that we keep our finger on the
pulse as a board of what's happening. And I think that that will help-- what would be the word?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Transparency?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, not just transparency, but really give incentive to the folks
working on the N Line to complete it knowing that it will consistently be in front of the Board of
Directors.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I think that that's good. So those are the only two pieces we're
adding on here, right? OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: Move to approve the agenda?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you-LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --as noted. [CHUCKLES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, it's been moved by Director-- by First Vice Chair Catlin.
And seconded by Treasurer Guissinger. All right, anything else?
PEGGY CATLIN: Shall we vote?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please. All in favor?

ALL TOGETHER: Aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All opposed? Discussion? OK, we're good. Done, next.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So other matters. So March 2nd, which is the Monday after Paul Ballard
starts, there's an employee orientation that lasts the whole day. We wanted your thoughts on his
attendance to that. It goes over all the benefits and things like that that-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, and all the mandatory training you have to have, like the-LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --alcohol and drug that all the new employees are required to take, and
things like that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Does he really need that? Is that going to be-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, we have to be able to show that all employees have gone through
that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: He has to spend the whole day there?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I kind of feel like he's going to be hard-pressed to get up to speed
anyway. I don't know if we can work with him or-- and HR can work with him to reschedule that,
or something like that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can-SHELLEY COOK: But just, I say, if he wants to attend, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: A whole day is really a big chunk of time for him.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I know. The only thing I would offer up is it's a perception issue too
with our employees, right? Because all of us are required to attend, even at our level. So that's the
only thing I would offer up, is it's going to be a-- now, I talked to him last night, and there's a good
chance to be here before-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --the 26th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
LYNN GUISSINGER: To work? Or to look for a place to live or what?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, to work.

LYNN GUISSINGER: Great.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I think he's hoping to come sometime towards the end of next week.
He's supposed to call me tomorrow or over the weekend and let me know.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Did you talk to him about the Legislative Committee or no?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No, I was-- he was on his way out and we only had 40 minutes. So I-what I was trying to get to him was the N Line-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --and we're going to get this happening. And I sent him a copy of the
press release and some of the other information that we have on it. So he would-- at least if he got
called or whatever, he would know what was going on and some of the players.
Because he was not familiar with Graham or the people at Balfour Beatty. So I just wanted to tell
him who they were. And I wouldn't put it past them to try to call him, either. So-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --I wanted to make sure he knew who those people were. And then,
we're going to follow up and go through a list of the legislation and the other issues that are
pending.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So I wouldn't mind briefing him on the legislation. You OK with me calling
him? And-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, do-- so I want to talk about who should be calling him so
that he's not getting multiple calls. I'm wondering if he could call in, and we could have briefings
for him and bring people to the table that need to brief him. So-HEATHER MCKILLOP: So he made a comment to me. I offered to do that for the N Line, and
his comment was he'd rather be there in person for these briefings.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And that's why he's going to try to get here as soon as possible. So his
thought was he would be here sometime next week. He was thinking even about coming on
Tuesday. But now that the Board Reimagine-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
I let him know that, that there wasn't a sense of urgency, other than the N Line meeting in the
morning. But he-- and I did say, well, we can call you and brief-- we can have the project team.

And he's like, well, I'd rather be in person for those type of briefings. So it made it sound like he
was going to try to get here sometime next week, maybe even midweek.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well-HEATHER MCKILLOP: But he needed to work that out with his wife.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And you're talking to him again?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes, he's supposed to call me back, either-- probably he said tomorrow
because he needed to work out things logistically. Because the original plan was he and his wife
to drive out here over next-- not this coming weekend, but the following weekend and, you know,
cross-country drive.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But he said now what he's thinking is he might just fly out sometime
next week, and then stay for a couple weeks, and then go back and get his wife and drive out and
bring their stuff. So-LYNN GUISSINGER: That'd be great. Will you just tell him about the statute-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --and what's going on?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes, so I told him-LYNN GUISSINGER: And then, tell him if he wants to know-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --he was going to call me when he had more time to go through the list.
I was asking him just logistical things. Like, when I schedule all these meetings with you are you
a morning person or night-- you know? Do you want me to do it at 7:00 in the morning? Or do you
want me never to schedule things beyond 8 o'clock in the morning?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And-LYNN GUISSINGER: What did he say?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But-HEATHER MCKILLOP: He said he'd have to get back to me on all that.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But when you're scheduling those briefings for him, maybe one
of them will be with Lynn and the team that's working on the legislation-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah. Oh, no, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --like Julie and those guys, so that-HEATHER MCKILLOP: We can get that one done faster-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be great. Because we don't know the timeline.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It could be Tuesday or-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It could be-LYNN GUISSINGER: --they've moved that right now. They've moved every hearing to this
coming Tuesday.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: From the 25th to-SHELLEY COOK: Oh, wow! How come?
LYNN GUISSINGER: The ADAPT people are have a conference and are going to be out of town
on the 25th. But Faith said something about trying to delay it. And I said, see if you can get that to
happen with Julie.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But I'll ask him that. But, yeah-- so I'm sure he wouldn't-- I mean, he-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do want to go back to this March 2nd thing, though. I think we
should talk about this a little bit in terms of really trying to get him to come into RTD and
immediately bond with the staff. It might be worth it to have him sit in on that day. Because then
he'll get-- they'll meet him-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, and we may be able to get away with a half a day. Because, I need
to go look at the schedule, but I'm pretty sure all those like-- what am I trying to say? Like, the
alcohol and tobacco and the EEO stuff, and I think that is all in the morning. And then, the
afternoon is more benefits, logistics, that kind of thing.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That would be great.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So then he would just be there in the morning?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Right. So we could just get him over there between 8:00 and noon, or
something.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be great.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And I think it starts here even, so-LYNN GUISSINGER: Let's see what he says. If he says , well, I really don't need it-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So-- but we'll have to give him those briefings that he has, you know?
PEGGY CATLIN: I think your point about the perception-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do too.
PEGGY CATLIN: --is really-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's important.
PEGGY CATLIN: --important.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And he's-- and everybody's at those. I mean, so it's representatives,
salary, anybody who's hired that day.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think it's worth his time to be there.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So I'll talk to him about that too.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Talk to him, yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then, I'll let you know. And then, we can start scheduling. And we
talked about probably meetings with the Board would be paramount before I have the individual
briefings with the SLT members, so-SHELLEY COOK: And, if you recall, at the Executive Search Committee meeting, we talked
about-- Judy and I-- coming up with a draft of here is what came out of the retreat as a way to-LYNN GUISSINGER: Executive summary?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, a letter of transmittal or executive summary. And we're working on that.
And it may be that he'll want to, or we can encourage further-- it'll be up to him, in part, to decide
what is in it.

BARBARA MCMANUS: So Susan Spero is requesting that she have a 30-minute call with him
and the Chair prior to the retreat.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And it probably would be good if it was after we gave him the executive
summary in the document.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good.
SHELLEY COOK: And-- I'm glad you brought that up because I want to talk about that-HEATHER MCKILLOP: And we've asked-- I've asked each of the SLT members to prepare a
one-page summary of what are the current things, big things, that he needs to know about. And
then, they can provide him a notebook of those documents that support that. And I told him that
we were working on that. He said that would be great.
And then, I plan on attending meetings with him. Because there's already tons of meetings-standing meetings, you know?
[CLANG]
And even for the first couple weeks I'll attend those meetings with him.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: You know, one thing that I did for the last CDOT transition plan, in the
document, was provide links, convenient links to information.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, that's probably a better way of doing it, yeah. I'll make a note of
that.
PEGGY CATLIN: And if we can do that, and then he-LYNN GUISSINGER: He could read it.
PEGGY CATLIN: --he could have an electronic version of those updates.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, that's a great idea.
PEGGY CATLIN: And then put links to him. Because we did that for when the Governor
Hickenlooper came in, and they said that was the best transition plan they'd ever seen.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: And Tina's working on getting him a cap and all those stuff set up sooner
rather than later so we can start getting his calendar filled in so that-LYNN GUISSINGER: That won't be a problem, will it?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No.
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So just so you know, on April 1st, the Metro Mayors Caucus has
put us down as presenting RTD.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And I think the 36 Community Solutions has you too, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, on March-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: --I think-HEATHER MCKILLOP: The Metro Mayors Caucus is meeting at-- still at the Chamber, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. So in March, it's the US 36 Coalition-- I can't remember the
date. I'll send it to you. And I'm trying to send everything to Barbara.
BARBARA MCMANUS: March 10th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, yeah, it is March 10th.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Like, at 7:00 AM in Broomfield.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And we can ask the question you and I were talking about. The 36 Mayors
and Commissioners do a trip every year to lobby in DC. It's a great trip. I did it last year, and-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: They want him to go this year. And it's right before APTA. It's
March 10th-- no, 11th, 12th, and 13th.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: --haven't been signed up for APTA.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, so then we're going to just say no to Audrey?

HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, I don't know. We'll have to see if he wants to go to APTA. But, I
mean, that's really close, right after he gets here. So it might be hard for him to just get here and
then go to APTA.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think it might be too.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, Van Meter typically goes, and then-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: To the?
LYNN GUISSINGER: On the Mayors and Commissioners.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, OK, yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So maybe it's better for him to just go and we have Paul just stay.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: It might be better for him to stay here and get-PEGGY CATLIN: Oriented? Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm thinking so too.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah. Because, I mean, that's-SHELLEY COOK: Because he'll decide this stuff, right? So it'll be up to him.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Ultimately, it will be up to him. But-HEATHER MCKILLOP: I'll ask him about it, but-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --that's a chunk of time too.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I would just guess with all this stuff going on-SHELLEY COOK: We trust his judgement on-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that the sentiment among Board was to really try and have him focus
on here. So-LYNN GUISSINGER: That's true, but I think we've also said in the past-- I agree with you about
the travel stuff, that changing our image out in the world is an important piece, you know?

PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It is huge. It is huge. So I think we'll just play it by ear and see
what he feels like he wants to do. You know, we hired him because of his experience and his
expertise-LYNN GUISSINGER: Right!
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --so he'll be able to see the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --about that. Because we need to get that done if he wants to go.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then-- but we also have the Bus Conference, which is now, what?
The Mobility Conference instead of the Bus Conference-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes. In May?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: That's coming up. Then we've got the Rail Conference in June.
LYNN GUISSINGER: In June.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then, we've got the-LYNN GUISSINGER: Are those here?
PEGGY CATLIN: No.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No, they're all over. And then, September is the-- or October is-- one of
those two, is the Annual Conference. So there'll be plenty of time for him to-PEGGY CATLIN: But there's also the two conferences that are-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Here.
PEGGY CATLIN: --hosted here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: AASHTO and-PEGGY CATLIN: AASHTO, TRB, and--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What was it?
PEGGY CATLIN: IBTTA.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: But they're going to do a tour of the US 36.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, I'm speaking at the IBTTA one, I think.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, they're doing a tour of US 36. So-HEATHER MCKILLOP: So will you sign those so I can get those? To AASHTO IBTTA?
Because IBTTA is May, right?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, it's IBTTA, AASHTO, and TRB. But I spoke to-- well, if you're
speaking, your registration will be comped.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: But they said that they might be able to arrange for a couple of comp
registrations-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: It's expensive, did you say?
PEGGY CATLIN: --which-- oh, it's really expensive.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's really expensive. The other thing is we've all cut our travel
expenses. And so not everybody's going to cut down on where they're going. And I think having
them here this-- in August or May, when they're going to be here, AASHTO-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, there's May and then there's August.
LYNN GUISSINGER: August.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We should really capitalize on that since we're all here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And Jeff Walker is also looking at APTA Leadership having their gettogether here-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.

BARBARA MCMANUS: --sometime next summer. They were looking for a location and talked
to me about the impact. I mean, the impact is really low. It's not like the special board meeting
seminar that we hosted or anything.
And I said I thought it would be fine. So he's going to bring it to them. I don't know if we'll get
chosen, but that's out there as well.
SHELLEY COOK: Good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Cool.
PEGGY CATLIN: I was not happy that Steve-- whatever his name is-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
He said that we're paying Paul Ballard $350,000 a year and Dave Genova $295,000. I mean, they
completely took it out of context.
SHELLEY COOK: He did present the information that Vince evidently provided, though, in terms
of the extra amounts and one being more all in and the other one having the added benefits. I was
actually pleased.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I was really please.
PEGGY CATLIN: That was kind of an afterthought.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I know, but for them to have to admit they called APTA, and
that APTA confirmed-PEGGY CATLIN: That, yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That was-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: --that we were right in the middle, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That was great. I know it hurt Kyle to say those words.
[LAUGHTER] But I almost want to write him a thank you note.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, don't get carried away.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, that one, no.
[LAUGHTER]

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You know, I am ill.
[LAUGHTER]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: She's on a lot of Zicam.
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, so I think that you'll let us know when he'll be here then,
for sure?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes, I will. He's supposed to get back to me, and I will let you guys
know. And I'll send it out.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I guess, for now, you're the point of contact. And-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, I can [INAUDIBLE]. That's fine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I mean, I'd like to chat with him. And I'd also like to have
him call into an Executive Committee or something before he gets here, too, if he wants to listen
in on what we're talking about and how we're moving forward.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Although, this is probably the only one before he gets here.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's probably right, unless we have a special one.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'm pretty he's listened to a number of them. Because I gave him all that
information. He asked for it at the interview.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, cool. All right, anything else under-LYNN GUISSINGER: Do we have an agenda? I don't have mine.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I'm sorry.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's on the front page of this.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, is it? I guess I do have one, sorry.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I did get the language from-LYNN GUISSINGER: There it is.

BARBARA MCMANUS: I did get the language from Bill Sirois about canceling the study session
that I'll be sending to the Directors after this meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
SHELLEY COOK: What's the reason for canceling it?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Based on where they are with pulling everything together, and the fact
that the last meetings were just this week, they didn't feel that they had enough information to
bring forward to the Board. And since there was nothing else going to be shared in that study
session, they thought it would be best if they waited till the Reimagine study session in March.
And I did confirm with them that it wouldn't be too cumbersome because we have a second subject
at the March study session as well. And that's an additional topic of SMS with Van Meter. We did
the overview last week.
SHELLEY COOK: That's right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then, he'll go more into depth in the study session in March.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, can I just add something to that one?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that we're going to-- Bill Van
Meter and I are trying to set up-- going to be setting up-- I don't remember if I told you this, sorry,
Barbara-- setting up meetings with the Board Members to have a conversation before the March
Workshop about the financial pieces of-- and where we are. And it's not going to be ready, so-LYNN GUISSINGER: Individual meetings, is that what you mean? Or two at a time?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, two-on-two's, or whatever. Just so you have a heads up. Because
we've redigested all the information in a different format this year.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, didn't we get the data-- the most recent data, the most raw data, right?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: For what?
PEGGY CATLIN: On sales and-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It looked good.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, that's not the issue, not so much. It's the whole package, right? So
now we have Asset Management that's driving what should be at every place and when. I'll just
give you an example.
In 2021, just to make operations even with the service reduction, we can't fund one asset, so
replacement. And I have to find at least one because we got federal funds for it, which is the Platte
Building roof.
So those are just examples of-- I need to walk you through all that-- is really no different than
where we were when you guys didn't adopt the Long Range Plan. So it shouldn't be a surprise to
most people. But now we have the actual asset list to go with the big numbers that I was giving
you. And so I want to show you how that plays out.
And what we've done is really start with revenues, and then just take out what do we have to fund?
These are the things we don't have to fund, but are in the plan now. But they're political, right? So,
anyways, I just wanted to give you a heads up. Because-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, and then what are the consequences of not funding them?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Correct. And then, if you do that, though, there's no money to do these
other things.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And so that means that we probably cannot support the service that we
currently operate, even with service reduction that we are doing, so-- but, again, that is nothing
different than what I told you back in September. But it's-- tomorrow is here today.
PEGGY CATLIN: It's supported by more-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I have more data.
PEGGY CATLIN: --more detail.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes, more detail.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And when are those meetings going to be?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So we're trying to set them up between-- it was going to be after the
meeting on the 18th, between that and the Reimagine Workshop on whatever date that is in March.
So over the next three weeks or so.

BARBARA MCMANUS: So the Financial Reimagine Workshop that you're doing? Or the study
session?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: The study session.
BARBARA MCMANUS: The study session.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Correct.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And the study session is?
PEGGY CATLIN: Might I suggest that be a top priority item to discuss with Paul Ballard?
[LAUGHS]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, yeah.
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: In fact, I really-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Just-[COUGHING]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You think that might be good-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that might be a top priority.
[LAUGHTER]
SHELLEY COOK: So that's scheduled for March 10th?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, so it will be in the-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Before, yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --three weeks that we'll be meeting. So just, I know you guys are
overwhelmed with meetings, but-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, OK. Director Cook, did you have something?

SHELLEY COOK: I just want to make sure we're talking about the retreat. You had mentioned
that Susan Spero had requested information or a phone call, it sounds, with Paul Ballard?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: And that's good. And I'm just hoping we can get from him his thoughts about
how we conduct that. Rather than just say, here's our agenda and do you have anything to add, I'm
hoping he can help to drive how we do it. I know it's a little bit tough with the timing, but-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: I just got-- this is the draft agenda I just received from Susan-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --right before this meeting. I haven't even handed off any-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--other than in this meeting.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Can we put on there other matters scheduled to talk a little bit about the
bill?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have it on here, yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then, also we-- there were some cursory conversations in the
retreat, and then also in the GMOC Executive Search Committee the other day about the 2021
goals. And the one thing that Susan captured on here was the fact that we have the opportunity,
since we're expanding, since we're giving Paul Ballard some strategic priorities to deal with in
2020, and we're shifting or overlapping, if you will, some of the goals for 2020 at this point,
whether or not, again, it doesn't make sense to establish these goals through 2021 more longer
range.
Because we're sort of putting some of the 2020 goals off in giving the priorities in the short term
to Paul Ballard. And since you, I think, Director Cook, you brought it up that maybe we could
have a retreat later in the year and talk about 2021. Well, the bylaws say that we have to have it
done by the end of the first quarter, which is why we have that retreat in March.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. We could-- I mean, the bylaws are something that we have jurisdiction
over. So we could modify those if needed. But I'm thinking that, for example, the March 10th

meeting on finances may constrain or set parameters around what we can do in 2021. And it seems
like we're doing it a little bit backwards.
We're setting the goals here, and then we're going to talk about all the things that impact on it. I
think he'll need to drive this, is my thought. Rather than us just power through our usual process,
let's let him have a say in how we move forward on the goals.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, but that's what I'm saying, that I think we need to be open to the
fact of him saying, these are the things-- these are the strategic priorities you want me to work on
in the short term. So in the long term, we've already established these 2020 goals. Let's see what
he thinks about expanding those out. Because whoever comes in as the permanent will be jumping
into those-- probably a lot of those goals that are in the midpoint, if you know what I mean.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So they'll be starting for 2021?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And, might I just add, I think the reason that the-- at least this is what
I've been told, and this is how we've done it since I've been here is-- is that the reason they do them
early in the year at that retreat is because that's what we build our budget around, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Are those goals?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, that's right.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Midterm plan. One thing we have struggled with in the midterm is that
we only have one-year goals, right? And so it's a little hard to do a midterm when you have oneyear goals.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, we don't really have a strategic, long-range plan. I guess we're doing[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: That's what I thought Reimagine would yield.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: It's supposed, yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So, ultimately, Reimagine is supposed to get us there. And that's why--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: In terms of service, at least, right? But is their long-range plan going to beHEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, yeah. It's going to have all of the-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The financials.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --money goals and everything else. But I was just going to tell you that's
why I don't, at this point, think they're in flux.
SHELLEY COOK: Can we explain in that call that this is how we normally do it. Obviously, we've
got all these other issues, so at least he's getting some of that information by then. And then, how
would he see us moving forward on the 2nd? Or not the 2nd. The 7th?
LYNN GUISSINGER: 7th, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The 7th?
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Which will be tomorrow.
[LAUGHTER]
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I know.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's what it feels like.
SHELLEY COOK: And also eight years, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, and also eight years, that's right.
[LAUGHTER]
Tomorrow and eight years. OK, so are we OK on this piece? Lynn, do you want to talk a little bit
about Senate Bill 151? What's happened and what you're thinking in how we move forward?
LYNN GUISSINGER: One thought is to ask for a listing of-- the Senate's asked for a listing of all
our real estate holdings. And it doesn't sound like we have that. But I know-- you know, Bill Sirois
and Chessy met with me like a week ago.

And she went through that whole TOD deck. And it listed the properties and whether they were a
good potential for that or not. Maybe we just send them that PowerPoint if-HEATHER MCKILLOP: We have that. I think we do have a list of the remnant properties, right?
That we would-- they don't call them that. Excess property, right? That we would be willing to do
something with. What doesn't exist outside of a database is-- because it's just massive, right? Is a
list of every piece of property we own.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Let's say, if we can-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But I can get those other things.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --to the TOD deck that shows that the-- you know?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Mm-hmm.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And maybe talk to Bill Sirois first, but-- and then-HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then, the list of-LYNN GUISSINGER: Property and-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Excess property.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --tell him that we only have a full listing in a huge database.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Why do they need that?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I don't know.
PEGGY CATLIN: Why? Do you know?
LYNN GUISSINGER: We were talking about TOD.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But you know where that's coming from.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So-HEATHER MCKILLOP: We just want to make sure-[INTERPOSING VOICES]

BARBARA MCMANUS: --we just forwarded a document to the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--we just forwarded a document of real estate to the Full Board from Henry recently.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Just recently, right?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Can you coordinate with-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --to get that out to Jack Tate? So, yeah, we met yesterday. And Senator
Winter took our-- well, really, what she had asked us to put together in terms of an Accountability
Committee.
And the governors-- and, oh, I've got several copies of this. I only have hard copies. I'll ask Sherry
to scan them. But these guys can scan it for us, right? I'd like it electronically.
And so the proposal that she's putting together has, umm-- a Blue Ribbon Commission that would
do a six-week deep dive. It's tri-- it's based on what happened in Boston with the Governors. And
they said that commission met 18 times in six weeks. So-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I don't know how they got those people to meet three times a week-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: I know.
[LAUGHTER]
PEGGY CATLIN: 18 times!
LYNN GUISSINGER: And then, after that they created an Accountability Committee that meets
for the next two years. And here I've got several copies. Gosh, I've almost got enough for
everybody. And then, we can ask John or somebody to scan it. That would be very helpful. Need
one there?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I didn't bring--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So this is what Faith put together after we-LYNN GUISSINGER: This is what Faith put together.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, after we sent her our stuff, OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So we sent her a-- really, well, everybody saw it. We sent her a bill, sort
of, that included some provisions that they had had and changed out some. The biggest thing, we
took out all the prescriptive things at the beginning. We changed-- we dropped all the-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Fossil.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --ADA language, the equity language of lawsuits, and put in just a nondiscrimination piece. And then, we took out the extra Board Members. You know, they at one
point started saying, after Faith had left I think, well, we'll do this on top of everything in our bill,
which wasn't supposed to-- that was the worry. Not supposed to be the-- you know, what we were
expecting.
So we're figuring out how we move forward at this point. I don't have a lot of problem. We haven't
really had a chance to sit down internally about where we are on this. They started pressing us,
you know, well, what if we just ask for injunctive relief? What if we limited damages? You know,
what if we only put one Board Member? What if the Board Member couldn't vote?
And I just said to all of that, I said I don't have Board authority to negotiate those specifics. I think,
because Faith only gave them this and not our full proposals-- this includes our proposal, but only
by mention-- I think they felt like we came not prepared to discuss anyway. And there were
advocates in the room ADAPT. It was JoyAnn and Colin Larson from the House, and Jack Tate
from the Senate, and then Josh and [INAUDIBLE] from ADAPT.
And so now we're trying to figure out what Faith Winter is willing to move forward, and how that- if it's going to be all of the provisions, like a mirror of their bill, except dropping out some of it,
like what we wanted, and then changing some. Or if she's going to-- it sounded a little, when she
left the meeting, like she was saying, all right, this one's my bill, and you all just carry your own.
That would be OK. That would actually be good if she does include all the other provisions. But
if we have to fight-- if it becomes, hey, let's pass all of these, if that's what they're proposing, then
we just have to figure out how we deal with it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So-- and the real pressing problem is that, I guess, the ADAPT group has
a conference. They're all going to be out of town on the 25th. So right now they've moved this up
to next Tuesday.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Ah, that's why.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And Julie's is trying to get that delayed. I said, well, we'd really like to
have Paul Ballard there and we don't have any time. I mean, tomorrow's the first last business day
before Tuesday to get our support in.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But Julie is going to ask if they can move it for us as well because
we don't have enough time.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we're hoping-LYNN GUISSINGER: She's going to talk to them.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then, this is also-- the governor likes this as well. And I think
that's huge.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: That's the Blue Ribbon Panel part.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that's the Blue Ribbon-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: --the Blue Ribbon Panel part. You know, the worst of all worlds is maybe
what they're headed towards is just this and there's.
SHELLEY COOK: In one bill.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Or even in two bills. Because this, if she does it and leaves out the nondiscrimination and the other parts, then we'll have to deal with both bills. I mean, I think we can
send this out.
We can talk about how we deal with it, but I think we're kind of-- the consensus is this is fine, you
know? Is that everybody's thought?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I mean, it has everything in it. We've put-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --done a lot of work on.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: She put all of out stuff, which is nice, and just added that step one, which
is all the Blue Ribbon Panel stuff. I mean, ideally, we wouldn't need that, but oh well.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah. The only thing I didn't see here was that the general fund would pay
for all of this.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I know. What it does say is that-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: The cost would be covered, or something?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --on the Committee-- on the Accountability Committee, it says will be
staffed by CDOT and having budget for research and consultants. But then it says the
Accountability Committee will receive a stipend that's equivalent to Board Members.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
You know, if there's eight or nine people, that's $9,000 a month-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --times two years is a lot of money, right? So I would be concerned
about that. But I don't-- she couldn't go into any other detail down below. She just says, unchanged
and nondiscrimination. So it looks like she tried to lift what we had and just add that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, it does.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: She also made the people of the Accountability Committee more
generic. Like, so we had Metro Mayors Caucus. I think she put local governments, right?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And we said-- and then, she added a human resource.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I was fine with all of that.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So I-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: --expert and fisc-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah.

LYNN GUISSINGER: So it broadened it a little, expert and fiscal policy.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: She's being a little broader.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So-HEATHER MCKILLOP: I think our thought was if we get-- if Tate and Larson don't want to
budge, it would be very difficult, I think, for this organization to support that bill in any way,
shape, or form.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: It's-- the fiscal note alone on it will be tremendous, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I agree with that too.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Especially with all the pension stuff in there and everything else. So that
would be large. And then-- but, if Winter introduced her bill that looks very similar to what we
have but with the Blue Ribbon, then that would make life easier. Because the Board could oppose
one-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We could support this.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --and we could support this one, right?
PEGGY CATLIN: One thing that isn't in here that was in our two-pager was the audit.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Correct, that piece is not in here. I don't know if she left that out on
purpose or she ran out of room or what. [CHUCKLES] Because it's not below either, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It seems to me if she wanted it in there-LYNN GUISSINGER: She would have put it?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --it would have-- put it in there.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, because she said, "keeps 151, including most of the oversight
provisions, conflict of interest, campaigns, fraud." This is exactly from our memo, right?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I doubt she's taking out the other provision, honestly. I bet that's more of
an oversight.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oversight, OK. That's-[INTERPOSING VOICES]

LYNN GUISSINGER: That's just a guess.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But it that's what gets in there, we can live with that-LYNN GUISSINGER: We can live with this.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --compared to all that other stuff in there, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, right.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And I think that's what we need to be-HEATHER MCKILLOP: It's not ideal.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --it's kind of what we can live with. You know, it seems to me like the
ADA provisions are critical for them. Whether they have to have a Board Member, that's where
we, you know, the river hits the road. But, I mean, ideally, we'll just have one bill we can support
and one bill we oppose. But we do have to think about whether we need to get a formal approval
from-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--Board Meeting at the beginning of our meeting on the 25th. Oh, I guess this is the Board Meeting,
unless we're talking next week, you know?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --several people gone, yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --minus four Board Members.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, minus four Board Members. We were talking about that
earlier. And then, I'll call you-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: And it would have to be a special Board Meeting because we-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --wouldn't have brought it through a committee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: The other thing we found out, which was interesting, I thought, was that
they said that she-- that Boulder Metro Mayors-- not Metro Mayors.
LYNN GUISSINGER: MCC, 36 Mayors and Commissioners, NADA.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, thank you. NADA, Adams County all oppose this bill. And so
what we are also talking about is, also by delaying it, is we can't get all those people lined up
potentially to testify by Tuesday afternoon.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But if we had another couple weeks, we could do a major outreach and
see who wants to be-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --even in the Southern Metro Area and stuff-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: That would be helpful.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Right. No, because-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Plus, we have that whole group of former RTD Board Mem-- or,
Chairs who said they would do it. Shelley?
SHELLEY COOK: Well, three things now. CML was moderating-- or no, what was the term?
They were-LYNN GUISSINGER: Monitoring.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Monitoring.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, have they taken a-- because that would be very helpful too.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, it would.
SHELLEY COOK: And you can make the case that, to the extent that the-HEATHER MCKILLOP: TML?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: --hamper our ability to do-- you know, to be responsive or something like, that
CML may want to weigh in on it.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, they probably see it as a slippery slope, right?
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So-SHELLEY COOK: Because many communities have their own transit agencies.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Barbara, should I just ask somebody to scan this?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I can do that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: So that was the first thing-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, that's good.
SHELLEY COOK: --see if we can get CML.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Both sides, yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: The second thing is do you-- have we normally-- I guess I need Barbara for
this, but-- have we normally had the board approve a position on bills or a legislature stance?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It has happened in the past before, just not often.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But for something like this, yeah, it's not unprecedented.
SHELLEY COOK: But it doesn't help them in the negotiating, you know? Because then there's
the what if. What if we pull this out and put that in? And then, you don't have a strong footing for
that. Is that what you're saying then?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I think the Board could oppose it. And if the bill changed materially,
right? Then the Board could always come back and support it. Or the Board could even say, we
support these kind of provisions in a bill, but not these provisions, or something.
SHELLEY COOK: So that's what I was wondering. Would that be helpful?
LYNN GUISSINGER: The MCC's decision was opposed unless amended. And-HEATHER MCKILLOP: There we go.

LYNN GUISSINGER: --you know, we'd have to think through-- to me, I was fine saying-- I said,
I don't have the authority to negotiate those details, but I feel very comfortable that we can oppose
the lawsuit provisions-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: --without Board. So that's a really good concern. I think this doesn't happen
that much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You know, we have to have our Legislator Team monitor a lot of things
and argue things. And they argue things that we all kind of agree with. But we just haven't had this
kind of legislation for many years-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, in a long time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I mean, most of this stuff, we say, it affects our Sales and Use Tax and
stuff like, right? So we know it affects-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --if it affects it, we just say-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
GUISSINGER: OK, thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: Or the family bill---that was proposed last year.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: So for this one, could we say, you know, you should feel comfortable with
informing and involving or getting the opinion of the Executive Committee, and we can make a
recommendation at the Board as a whole or something? Is there something that, if you had to come
up with-- or if--

PEGGY CATLIN: A muted response?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: A quick-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: So-LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, that's a good idea we'll have to think through.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The thing is we're going to have to be fluid and be ready to move
pretty quickly, I think. That's the whole thing that makes this really cumbersome I think.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So it-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, and you have to be aware you have Board Members that support
the bill.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Or-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --who to-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: That's the rug pulled out.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: And then, the third thing is, if you read this and the prior discussion about the
Board-PEGGY CATLIN: And-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Potentially.
SHELLEY COOK: --constitution--

PEGGY CATLIN: --and Jeff Walker.
SHELLEY COOK: --the desire for expert advice, you know what I mean? So it seems like when
you read this that the gist is we want to get fresh, expert eyes on this. You know, people who don't
have a dog in the hunt.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: And, in some ways, that's what we have with Paul Ballard. And it seems like
the earlier you can get him into-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: And so it seems-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, and we don't even-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--have to rely on him. We have a whole Blue Ribbon Committee right now that can bring a fresh,
expert eyes on the issues they're concerned about. But they're just not open to-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, Lynn even went through in detail when Winter was there and said,
hey, wait a second, we're getting an interim and we're going to get a new permanent that's going
to be different, right? We have a board that has a new Chair. We have taken some bold actions
recently and these type of things. And even Winter said that's not enough. Yeah, she was-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What else does she-- do they want?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, they were more explicit about it.
[LAUGHTER]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, what's this.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And we're fine-- I mean, yeah, good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.

SHELLEY COOK: But the point being, it's really important for him to get in front of them pretty
soon, I think, so that they can-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, yeah. No, I think that's absolutely true.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It might be Tuesday.
SHELLEY COOK: So if it is Tuesday-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--yeah, let's see if we can get him up for Tuesday if it turns out to be-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: You know, but we have to remember that this is the first step in process.
This is the Senate Committee. I mean, we want it to-- initially, you get [INAUDIBLE]. But it will
have a lot of places at which it can be amended or opposed. And-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then, we do-- if it is Tuesday, we need to figure out who's testifying,
right? It probably needs to be not every Board Member, but-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--at least-LYNN GUISSINGER: I think Julie said no more than three probably Board Members.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Right, so I would-LYNN GUISSINGER: --but if we can get-BARBARA MCMANUS: So I think there would need to be at least you two, the Chair and the-the Chair and the Chair. And then, we need to try to figure out how to line up as many people as
quickly as possible to be there.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, we need to-- I think the LCC folks-- you know, the-SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.

PEGGY CATLIN: I-SHELLEY COOK: It might be a good added voice, is what you're thinking?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And [INAUDIBLE] from the CAC, he opposes it. It sounded like he hasANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: John Tayer-LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --Representative to the Board.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I talked to John this morning.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, sir.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): I'm just wondering-- it's difficult to follow this sometimes with
everybody overtalking. I'm curious, at what point in time before people testify before the
legislature do you intend to bring this before the full Board to get authority to proceed and state
the position of RTD? As opposed to, which is that, probably of course, always welcome, the
position of individual Directors.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We were just-- I know it's hard to hear on the phone sometimes, Doug. We
were just discussing that. That it would-- probably the first opportunity. You know, right now
they've moved the hearing up to the 18th, which is Tuesday. So there's no way to get a decision
from the Board.
But we were in the position yesterday where they kept saying, well, what if we changed this? And,
you know, I was-- we were having to say, we don't have the authority to do that. So I think the
answer is as soon as possible, which probably is on the 25th, either-- I guess it would be a Directorinitiated matter or a special-- I don't know-- well, probably the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it would probably be a Special Board Meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It has to be a Special Board Meeting.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --probably the 25th. And--

DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Mm-hmm.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And what I was just saying is that next week, if they make us do the hear- we're trying to get it delayed. If we have to do it next week, we may have to take big picture
opposition to the specific things that-- and we can call around to the Board, which we sent it out
to the Board.
But the lawsuit provisions, I think, we'll have pretty unanimous consent on. And then, we'll just
have to talk about some of the other things. Adding more members to the Board doesn't seem like
a good solution. But-- in other words, yeah, we're trying to figure out-- we're trying to postpone
things until we can get it to the Board, but-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I don't think the bill sponsors care.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
[LAUGHTER]
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Well, and if I may, Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): I was just going to say recall, even if you cannot give to the full
Board, and it is required that the hearing be before that date, each Director and each Member of
the Executive Committee can always show up and simply testify as to their opinion. It's just that
they are prohibited from saying "the RTD objects to."
That would take full Board action. But there's nothing preventing people from showing up and
saying, I think this stinks. And the next Director who's going to speak is going to stay the same
thing. So there is some flexibility on that. I just-- I don't want 10 other Board Members saying,
wait a minute, how come the Executive Committee is making all these decisions?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, we're not going to do that. What I think could be stronger, and we
could say, is if we call everybody before then and say, here are the points. Here are the three people
that we're planning to have testify, and here are the points. That these lawsuits would really slow
down our-- make it very difficult for us to try anything new, giving maybe the example of the N
Line, or some other examples we have.
That adding four members to the Board-- we'll probably support the Blue Ribbon Commission and
the Accountability Committee, and say that they're going to look at governance. They're going to
look at whether they we need changes in the Board. So let's let this team do its work.
But in order to do that, what I would probably suggest is that we call around and be able to say,
we don't have an official position from the Board, but we do have a consensus that this is the
direction we will go, or something like that. What do you think of that, Doug?

DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Well, I think it's just a question of being very careful with your
phrasing.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Right.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): As long as you're careful with your phrasing, I think you get the
point across. But it would bad-- because, recall that there are times when we have taken an official
position on bills. I think it was either last year or the year before that Dave and I testified on one
bill. And as soon as we were done, Natalie Menten was the next speaker-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): And made it her [INAUDIBLE] opposition. And she was very
careful in phrasing it that way, but she was entitled to do so-LYNN GUISSINGER: And that may be what happens.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): --and did that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah. No, I think Heather and I were in the meeting yesterday with a
couple of others, and we were very careful to say that we don't have-- because they kept wanting
to negotiate specifics. Well, what if we just cap damages? And we said, we don't have the authority
to discuss that. So-DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Mm-hmm.
LYNN GUISSINGER: But, yeah, I agree with you. I think we all do.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So, Lynn?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Next steps.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Next steps. Let's see if we get our delay. I guess if we don't get our delay,
we've really got to fly into action. And we started this morning, talking to people at the Reimagine.

I'd really like to get a little support from the South. And Jackie, we started talking to her. It wasn't
clear which way she would-- whether she would. But-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I wonder about-LYNN GUISSINGER: --we'll get Joe Lamers and-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --the Southeast Partnership? They might step up.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that Doug's thing?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, this one is-- they have a TMA over there. I'm trying to
remember the name of it.
SHELLEY COOK: Ridge McClintock, his place?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's not Ridge McClintock. It used to be-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--because Mecias was there. But it's the Southeast-- it's like the bid out there.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Hey, could I ask him?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Doug! Doug? Well, the 36 MCC and NADA and the Adams County
Commissioners have all said-- taken a position opposing the current bill, I think absent
amendments. But we don't have, yet, support in the South. And I don't think it's come up to them.
Do you have any suggestions for-- it would-- these-- this co-sponsor, I don't know where-- well, I
know that Larson and Jack Tate are both in the South-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: --Jack lives in Centennial and Colin lives in Ken Caryl.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Any suggestions for groups or cities or-- I've talked to Jackie Millet a little
bit this morning.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Yeah. Yes, Denver South Economic Development PartnershipANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that's it.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): --is the TMA for--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, that's it.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): And we can talk to Tom Brook, who is the Executive Director
of Denver South EDP, and have him bring it forward. And they can probably do a telephone poll
for that and take action.
And we could-- Jackie Millet is an excellent thought. We could also talk to Stephanie Piko, mayor
of Centennial, for her support in that regard. We have to be careful in picking the electeds, because
there are some that don't have great feelings for us right now.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Right.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): As you know in dealing with the North. But, nonetheless, yes,
I'd start with Denver South TMA. And, if you want, I can contact them with you, Director
Guissinger, or with the Chair and get them on board. But that would be, I think, the most impactful
from the South.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That would be great. And does-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: What about your Chamber, Doug?
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): The Chamber itself probably would be more cumbersome
because the legislative action committee has to consider these things. And, even though they meet
relatively frequently during the session, it's still like over every other week.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): And right now there's been a lot of change in leadership at the
Chamber, so I'm not sure. As I said, the TMA is the official source-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I think the TMA might be a good one.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): --for this kind of stuff. And I think that would be best.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And remind me who you said Stephanie Piko is?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Mayor of Centennial.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): She's the Mayor of Centennial.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK. That would be great. And, like I said, there's a chance that this is set
for hearing next Tuesday. And I think we have to try to get whatever we can out then and recognize

that we're going to have to fight it further along, and have people talk to the legislators and things.
Because , like you said, there are a lot of groups that just aren't going to be meeting. And-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You know, I think we could get all of the TMAs in the region to
also oppose this. There's like eight of them, and they're all over. So is Boulder-LYNN GUISSINGER: That'd be great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I could work on the TMAs.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, there's the one at [INAUDIBLE] West.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Madam Chair?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes, Doug?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Who, pardon?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
This is Madam Chair.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): If you would like, I will probably see some of those people
tonight at the Emperor's birthday party. So we can probably talk to some of them even tonight and
let them know that we can contact them tomorrow morning.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You got an Emperor down there?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I was like, you guys have an Emperor?
[LAUGHTER]
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): It's the Japanese Emperor.
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah-PEGGY CATLIN: We want an Emperor.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, we want an Emperor birthday party. Yeah, I think that
would be great, don't you?

LYNN GUISSINGER: That would be great. I think starting to talk to anybody and starting to put
together a list of who would support us, who would come and testify, who would write a letter,
who would call their reps, you know?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think yes, please, have at it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah
LYNN GUISSINGER: And I think the main-- we're putting together some talking points here. I
have to read through it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, you suggested CML?
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hmm.
PEGGY CATLIN: CML. You know the-SHELLEY COOK: I was just trying to think of who we could maybe-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, Director Tisdale, when you talk to folks-PEGGY CATLIN: Roger, let's get Roger on it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --if you could just send us who you've talked to so we could put
together a list and know who's-LYNN GUISSINGER: A master list.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --a master list so we know who's been talked to. That would be
great.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Yes, ma'am.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin just had a great idea to see if Roger can help us with CML.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, we talked about that earlier.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, we talked about that.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Sherry's supposed to reach out to him, I think.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: We want-SHELLEY COOK: Is it-- is that confirmed? Does she-HEATHER MCKILLOP: No. Well, we were going to get back to her to discuss-SHELLEY COOK: OK.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --if that's what we wanted to do.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But I think we were waiting to hear whether Winter was going to run
her own bill and when the actually meeting was today.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This is so hard because we don't know if we have to plan for seven
days or for 14 days.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: There's a big difference here. And it seems to me that maybe this
afternoon we should just start putting together a strategic plan of action with dates on it for the
18th, and then for the not 18th. At least, we would get everything ready-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And that's five days-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --move it out to the-PEGGY CATLIN: God, it would be nice to know.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So Sherry brought over talking points as well that I gave to Director
Guissinger. John scanned that, as well as the document that was asked to be scanned. And he sent
it to everybody here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And this is for you, Lynn. These are all over the past RTD Position
House Bill Resolutions that we've done in the past-LYNN GUISSINGER: Great, thank you.

BARBARA MCMANUS: --so you have for reference.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You were speedy!
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, she was on it this morning. She already had them, which is
really helpful. Because the one thing we're learning about this bill is that it's really fluid and we
don't know.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So I can get Sherry to start-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be great.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --working on the tracking sheet. And-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, and talking points. And I think I would like it to run the
way that we ran the N Line when we called people. Because it really, I think, helped solidify
streamlining what we're saying.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Denver, obviously, would be a-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: What about the Denver Chamber?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, that would be Roger. But I'm having-- so Jordan Sayers for
sure is coming tomorrow for the tour of the N Line. And I will talk with her and the Mayor about
this Senate Bill and what they can do.
Denver has consistently called me. I've met with Nesbitt. We met with Josh. We met with Jordan.
And they all said the same thing, which is tell us what you need us to do. We've not been a good
partner and we want to step up. So I think this would be a great way for them to do it. OK, anything
else?
SHELLEY COOK: I just have one more item.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: So I believe that all of the Directors received this invitation to the DIA on-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We got an email.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --email.

LYNN GUISSINGER: We got an invitation that was free-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --and I was wondering if-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah!
LYNN GUISSINGER: --that was the one we got-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: $150. So some-LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, the one on the internet was just-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It was just bring a guest.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It had that price.
SHELLEY COOK: And it said, this is not transferable, which kind of implied that-BARBARA MCMANUS: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: --it was.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So some folks got the hard copy and some folks, I guess, got the email.
I didn't see the email. But the resolution clearly says that-- so we do the research on it when we
find out about. It it's $150 a person.
We have some directors that did RSVP. And we were already working on it. So we're working
with them to see who's there and who's not there.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm on it and I said and a guest, because they said bring a guest.
And they said, OK. But it didn't even dawn on me until I saw [INAUDIBLE] thing, and I was like,
uh-oh. [CHUCKLES]
SHELLEY COOK: Well, do we know for sure they're not comping some people?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: But then the question is, can we accept that comp?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We can't.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You can't accept a comp.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We can't accept it. So-BARBARA MCMANUS: So we'll be-- if you want to go, we'll be paying the $300 if it's a couple.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But wait a minute. We can only pay-- I thought we could only pay
for ourselves. And then, if we wanted to take someone-BARBARA MCMANUS: You have to pay.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We have to-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, you have-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --pay that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we can't take the $300 out of our account.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It would be $150.
BARBARA MCMANUS: If two people go.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So people need to know that-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --that we need to cancel the free one. And then, we have to decide
if we want to go and it-PEGGY CATLIN: I'll be out of town.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --would come out of our budget.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, sir?
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): May I point out that the gift to a spouse or a guest is not a
reportable event under the amendment. That's a separate transaction as between those individuals.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh! So we could accept that?

DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): As to Directors, they are allowed to accept gifts up to-- and I
forget what the inflated amount is now-LYNN GUISSINGER: It's $65.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, so it's under.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): --$65.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I mean, it's-DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): So the only cost that needs to be covered is to spread the delta.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No.
PEGGY CATLIN: No.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No, I would not recommend that. [CHUCKLES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, I think if it's coming through us, that it's still a gift to us, isn't it?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, that's how-LYNN GUISSINGER: I mean, even if it's our spouse?
BARBARA MCMANUS: --that's how legal interprets it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That's what I would-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --that they wouldn't have been invited-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If-BARBARA MCMANUS: --if it were not for the invitation to the elected official, in our case.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It sounds like, to keep it clean, we just need to say no. And then,
let people know that the Board can RSVP for them out of their local budget. But if they wanted to
take someone else-SHELLEY COOK: It's out of their pocket.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --it would be-- it would be out of their pocket, correct.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And we have the ability to pay for both tickets and get a check back
from Directors. And we deal with that on the V card.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And we have done that, and we keep a pretty clean process of that as
well.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we could offer that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And so, before we sent an additional email out, I just wanted to socialize
that with this group and let them know what the resolution says. And, you know, yes, there is
always a dollar amount, even though it's not listed.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. [LAUGHS] I'm only laughing because I invited someone and
I'm going to have to call and say no, you can't go.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
I can't take you for $150. And you have to wear silver it says-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--because it's their 25th anniversary.
SHELLEY COOK: I'm glad you're going.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I don't own anything sil-- well, this stuff, I don't-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--you're going?
SHELLEY COOK: No, but I'm glad you're going.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: Is there anything else?
LYNN GUISSINGER: What was your question?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I don't have anything else. Does anybody else have anything
else? Let me just say this, the tour this morning for the N Line, nobody went. And then, we have
another tour scheduled for tomorrow morning with some Mayors.
And then, my understanding-- I'll be there I think Director Buzek, Director Whitmore, and Director
Lubow will also be there, along with Henry and his team. And I don't know which Mayors have
confirmed.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Apparently, Director Whitmore sent me an email from his work email,
and it's being blocked for RTD. So I did not get it.
[LAUGHTER]
So-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Sorry, that's not funny.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --we're trying to figure out how-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --work emails.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I asked him to send it again to me and John. Hopefully, we can get it
through. Because we were pretty close to the maximum of 15.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And so we may have to make additional arrangements if we're past that
number.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, we won't know then till later.
SHELLEY COOK: You've posted it, I take it?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, it's posted.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, other than that, I don't have anything. Does anybody else
have anything? Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): No, ma'am, thank you.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Have fun at the Emperor's party.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, go get them.
DOUG TISDALE (ON PHONE): [INAUDIBLE]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, then I'm going to-- can I get a motion to adjourn?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So moved.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All in favor?
ALL TOGETHER: Aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All opposed? OK, we are now adjourned at 12:38, 12:38. Thank
you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So, Lynn, what I was suggesting was to find out what CDOT thought
about-PEGGY CATLIN: We had heard that they were opposing. And then, Julie talked to-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Shoshana?
PEGGY CATLIN: No, Cas-- what's his name?
