BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 26, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) for OnCall Construction Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the
most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed
$67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services Contractor. The work in this Contract includes
providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction
Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal and Communication System, and Trackwork
construction services. Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget
for current year projects. Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the RTD 2014 goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery and the
2015 goal of Improving Service Delivery. RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform civil and
structural work on various projects. As RTD’s rail system has grown and with the complexity of
FasTracks, the need has arisen for an on-call systems construction services contract for electrical
systems. This is specialized work that can only be performed by specific contractors and is critical to
supporting Light Rail Operation.
In September 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for construction services for On-Call
Systems Construction work. On October 24, 2014, two written proposals were received:
1. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)
2. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
The six RTD evaluation team members evaluated the written proposals and conducted a preliminary
ranking according to the following evaluation criteria:
A. Management, Organization, Experience and Approach………………..50%
B. Cost……………………………………………………………………………..35%
C. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged
and Small Businesses and WIN Program………………………………….15%
DISCUSSION
The ranking of the two proposals was very close as both firms have extensive experience and a good
track record with RTD. The following is the result of the evaluation by the six member evaluation team:
1. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
2. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The team concluded that Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC) was the recommended best value
contractor based on the following criteria:
A. Team Resources – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
demonstrated the ability to perform under the RFP, has the ability to fully support and provide
the necessary staff and equipment to fully implement the Scope of Work.
B. Project Management Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction
Company (MEC) provided a strong project management approach including providing different
options for completing projects identified in the Scope of Work.
C. Schedule Performance and Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC) provided a thorough approach for schedule performance and
completion of projects. They demonstrated their ability, resources and capability to comply
with the Scope of Work.
In addition, Mass. Electric Construction Company’s (MEC) proposed DBE goal exceeded the 16% goal
advertised in the RFP and meets the 8% WIN goal. Therefore, the evaluation team recommends Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) based on best value for RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects.
Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation
criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services
Contractor. The work in this Contract includes providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction
services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal
and Communication System, and Trackwork construction services. Funding for the contract award is
included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects. Funding for future year
projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award a contract
to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of
the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300. This action is not recommended
because it will affect the capability to perform necessary State of Good Repair projects in a timely
manner on the current light-rail system. Also, the ability to quickly respond to critical systems
repairs on the light-rail system will be jeopardized.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the systems on-call construction services approach. This is not
recommended as experience has shown that an on-call services contract provides the highest quality
at the lowest price for these miscellaneous specialized projects. In addition, it provides immediate
response to any required emergency actions in the system area.
