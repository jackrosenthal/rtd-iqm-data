#### 1. Recommendation for Contract Award to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC) for On-Call Systems Construction Services

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services Contractor.  The work in this Contract includes providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal and Communication System, and Trackwork construction services. Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects. Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.

Motion:               Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, introduced Frank Buczkowski, Sr. Manager for Systems Engineering and Construction.  Frank Buczkowski told the Directors that the 5 year contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. (BBII) expired.  During the duration of the contract, RTD and BBII did about $45 million work on individually funded projects.   This allowed for faster completion of projects instead of individually bidding the projects. He said that RTD has identified $67 million worth in projects that would benefit from being addressed using the on-call contractor process.  Some projects that will be addressed once the contract in discussion is awarded are a light rail power switch upgrade and a programmable logic controller upgrade for the Southeast corridor.  Projects will be addressed as they get budgeted within their departments.

Director Folska expressed her confusion as the background discussion seemed to be about FasTracks capital investments yet the Directors are hearing about it during the Planning & Development Committee meeting.  She said that she was keen to make sure RTD operations are safe, especially in light of the recent IT failure, but the discussion made it sound like staff is in a rush to spend $67 million.  Rick Clarke explained that most of the work is for base system operations.  This does not preclude the contractor from doing work on FasTracks operations.  He added that any expansion would have to come from the FasTracks budget and the Directors would have to approve it.  Rick Clarke noted that the specialized contractor will do electric work and software work for light rail.  These operations are separate from IT operations.

Director Lubow said that it would have been nice to have more information on the discussion section of the Board report.  She noted that she could not tell from the report if this was base operations or FasTracks.  Frank Buczkowski said that one project would be on FasTracks, at Sheridan on the West corridor.  This project is yet to be budgeted for.  Once budgeted, it will be sent to the Directors for approval.  He said this will happen in 2017.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program

Susan Altes, Manager for Real Property, reviewed the Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program presentation included in the Planning & Development Committee meeting packet for December 2, 2014.  The presentation gave an overview of the properties in the program.

- Alameda & Havana Park-n-Ride

Susan Altes said that this property was sold to the adjacent property owner, Mike Naughton Ford, as was approved by the Board in December, 2013, as part of the Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program.  Committee Chair James clarified that this property was originally acquired when RTD purchased the land to build the Alameda & Havana Park-n-Ride, which is just south of the vacant land.  Susan Altes stated that was correct.

- 13th & Zuni

Susan Altes noted that this property, the remainder from Siegel Oil, was purchased for the West Corridor.  RTD has received several inquiries regarding the property.  The property requires Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approval to be disposed.  RTD has sent the FTA the request for disposal.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available during the first quarter of 2015.  The RFP will require consideration of Transportation Oriented Development (TOD) as desired by the City and County of Denver (Denver).

- 104th & Riverdale

Susan Altes explained that this property was bought for a Park-n-Ride in relation to the SkyRide.  Staff is in the process of meeting with the City of Thornton, the adjacent property owner, and RTD Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) staff members.  The adjacent owner is the only one who has shown interest in the property.  Staff recommends holding on to the property as it is within a mile from the planned Colorado Boulevard station on the future North Metro line.

- 13525 Weld County Road 8 and 2542 Weld County Road 27

Susan Altes noted that these properties were acquired by Union Pacific and assigned to RTD.  She said she has met with the City of Brighton and the Mayor of Ft. Lupton to brainstorm marketing possibilities.  Both properties have had inquiries.  The County Road 27 property has received an offer.

She said that staff is still working on reviewing the policies for disposition of property through unsolicited proposals and is not ready to make a recommendation to the Board.  Susan Altes noted that she will be working with Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for TOD, to develop a policy for disposition of real property.  This policy will be presented to the Board for approval.

Committee Chair James asked staff what they have learned about methodology of disposing property through this process.  Susan Altes replied that staff has learned that markets cannot be created and that an interest must exist first.  Contacting the adjacent owner of the Alameda & Havana property worked out brilliantly.  She noted that staff will learn more as they continue to work with the adjacent owner of the 104th & Riverdale property.  Bill Sirois added that the Alameda Bus Barn site, which is not part of the Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program, will also provide some insights.  He noted the similarities between the Bus Barn site and the 13th & Zuni property.

Director Folska asked for the appraisal and final sale amounts for the Alameda & Havana property.  Susan Altes answered that the property sold for $1.2 million.  She said the property was appraised for lower and that she used her Board approved ability to negotiate within a percentage of the appraised value.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, told Director Folska that staff will contact her with the specific figures.

Director Folska asked staff if they were considering a ground lease versus selling the Weld County Road 27 property.  She suggested this as a way of receiving revenue in perpetuity.  Susan Altes said that this could be a possibility.  She added that the Weld properties are outside of the District.  Rick Clarke mentioned that each property needs to be looked at on a case by case basis in order to assess the interest in owning versus leasing.  Director Folska affirmed that the key is marketing.  She noted that good marketers can create a market where there is none.  She said that the Board has excelled at finding alternative streams of revenue to support base operations.  She wondered what could be other areas for funding, such as naming rights, asset inventory, etc.

Director Tobiassen mentioned that he was glad to see movement in these properties.  He noted from his experience on the E-470 Board that some properties have mineral rights.  Susan Altes said that RTD does not own the mineral rights for the Weld properties.  She added that RTD has been contacted about leasing the surface by the mineral rights owners; they propose paying an up=front fee and then a royalty if anything is found.  Director Tobiassen said that such investment may not be worth it.

Director Bagley said that ground leases may be a more marketable option in densely populated areas.  Areas with less population tend to lean towards owning.  Committee Chair James added that ground leases may occur in some areas.  He said that the interest depends on the particular market and the many variables that influence each one. Bill Sirois noted that there is a ground lease option on the Bus Barn site’s RFP.  Staff is hoping to let the market respond.  He agreed that some developers are hesitant on ground leases while others have recently showed some interest.

Chair Sisk agreed with Director Folska in looking at available opportunities.  He said he was pleased to see TOC and properties working together.  He also agreed in holding the 104th & Riverdale property as the market will grow in the next few years.

Chair Sisk told staff that it would have been helpful to add to the presentation the acres per property.  He said that a narrative report explaining lessons learned and other aspects of the pilot program would have enriched the presentation.

Committee Chair James noted that disposing of these properties involve a lot of moving targets and judgments.   He wondered if a policy may be too specific for the constant changes in the market and needs.  He said the key is to stay focused on RTD’s mission: what is in the best interest of RTD with the assets.

Director Hoy commended staff on the progress made on the pilot program.  He said that he had no problem holding on to property if it would be beneficial for the agency.  He noted that in some cases it may be in the best interest to dispose of the property.  Director Hoy pointed to staff to be the ones doing the work and tell the Directors what makes sense.

Director Hoy agreed with Chair Sisk in how a short narrative on the pilot program would have been helpful to the discussion.

Director Deadwyler expressed that one of the things she is hoping to focus on going forward is how RTD can generate additional revenue.  She wondered if perhaps RTD does not have the right staff that knows how to generate revenue.  She said that it pains her to hear that RTD staff sold property below market value.  Director Deadwyler does not believe RTD is that desperate that we need to sell at any cost; she thinks that holding on to property while the economy comes around to get more money is a better idea.  Committee Chair James clarified that the property sold was not sold under value.  Susan Altes stated that was correct as the Alameda & Havana property was actually sold for above market value.
