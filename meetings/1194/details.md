Chair Anderson opened up the meeting by reviewing the order of the items for the Board meeting agenda. Director Daly inquired about the retiree Joe Stogner and indicated that he worked with him for years.  Director Daly agreed to comment about his service at the Board meeting.

Chair Anderson asked Director Bagley to speak on his update for the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.  Director Bagley indicated he will share that the Committee and other Board members have been reviewing the GM goals for 2014 which will be voted on tonight.  They have had some productive discussions that show the Board members are involved in the process and are engaged in their focus on the General Manager, their only employee.  He thanks all of them for their input.

## V. Other Matters

- General Manager Washington stated that in the North Metro Quarterly meeting this morning, he had announced the date for the opening of the bus terminal at DUS to be May 9, 2014 which is ahead of the anticipated schedule in the original FasTracks plan. They had stood up an activation committee approximately 12 months ago whose function is to determine readiness to open.  They are coordinating with DUSPA and the USA for the historic building hotel and retail center.  They will make an announcement today which will include quotes from Walter Isenberg on their plans to open the hotel and retail in late July.  A heads-up has been given to the stakeholders (i.e. DUSPA, City of Denver, Tami Door-Downtown Denver and CDOT).

Director Daly inquired about the closure of Market Street Station.  General Manager Washington indicated the closure will coordinate to the run date of May 10, Sunday morning when the switch gets flipped.

Chair Anderson pointed out how important it will be to communicate to the people from the West corridor and the North on options to access the AF Skyride from DUS to DIA.  This opens up new options for them.  General Manager Washington added there are many other aspects to this opening to be worked out such as the straightening out of the street and signaling on Market Street.

Director Bagley inquired how far ahead of schedule were we?  General Manager Washington indicated about 4-5 months but did provide a qualifier around this statement.  Director Bagley responded it is very important that the riders of the SE/SW lines understand they will have new alternatives for getting to DUS and the airport. We need to notify these riders of light rail C&E and the ability to get to the airport a different way.  Some of his constituents have expressed concern over the loss of Skyride service from southwest.

- General Manager Washington indicated that Leadership APTA will meet in Denver next week.  Jenny Barket, legal, is our representative in this program.  RTD will serve as host and the staff will be presenting in a number of sessions.  The Board has been invited to attend some of the sessions on Wednesday, July 17th.

- On September 5, Denver will host the Western CEO Roundtable.  This consists of CEOs/GMs from transit properties in the west (i.e. Dallas, SLC, Phoenix and Seattle).

- Next week the Multi-Agency Exchange program (MAX) will have their graduation in Denver.  The MAX program currently has representatives from three transit properties doing knowledge sharing and exchange.  Some of the GMs from the Western CEO Roundtable will be participating in the graduation ceremonies.

- The COMTO Colorado organization will host its annual golf tournament next week.  Monies raised from this event goes toward the scholarships that are given to students with interest in transit or transportation.

- General Manager Washington indicated he had met with Don Hunt of CDOT.  They are gearing up for Impact 64, the statewide sales tax initiative for 2014.  CDOT has the lead on this and RTD will simply march in step with CDOT.

- General Manager Washington provided updates on HR related items with focus on investment in human capital.

- Director Bagley provided the following comments:

o        He requested the process or mechanism we are using to provide support to former Director Cohen during his illness.

o        He indicated he will provide slides from Tom Clark’s presentation that shows projected growth and population changes over the next few years by quadrants.  He thinks this is beneficial information for the people engaged in the Northwest Mobility study.

o        The South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce hosted an executive meeting on infrastructure issues.  He would like to consider hosting the next session on Infrastructure II at RTD.   This is a great chance for RTD to get hooked into the discussions.  He will explore this opportunity for late fall or early spring.

o        He would like to follow-up on a conversation he had with the AGM for capital programs related to SW corridor small group meeting with stakeholders.

o        On a return trip from the Mountains (Aspen area), he had a chance to observe the RAFTA (BRT) in that area.  The system operated smoothly with the busses whizzing past while the rest of the traffic remained bogged down.

- Director Walker apologized for arriving late due to work commitments.

- Chair Anderson indicated that RTD had participated with the City of Arvada in a selection of a developer for Olde Town.  She attended a meeting where the focus was on the partnership between RTD and the City of Arvada for Olde Town.  The City of Arvada is very pleased with this relationship.  RTD is well thought of in the City of Arvada.

- Director Hoy commented about the North Metro Quarterly meeting that was held this morning.  There were 30+ people in attendance.  He can see a change in attitude and a spirit of cooperation.  They are very committed to getting this thing done.  It was a good and valuable meeting.  The stakeholders appreciated the information provided by RTD.

- Director Daly commented on the letter sent to General Manager Washington from a stranger who had come into town and been assisted by the General Manager.  He asked the General Manager what may have been confusing-perhaps a lack of signage.  General Manager noted he does not think anything was missing but sometimes as a new person in town, one can become discombobulated.  This is the kind of help that our employees give to people every day.

- Director Walker asked the General Manager if he knew Anthony Graves who was announced by Mayor Hancock as Director of Regional Affairs.  General Manager Washington indicated he is familiar and may try to introduce him to the Board.  We believe he will replace Paul Ryan.

- Director Hoy shared that in a communications with Mayor Heidi Williams about paying for parking for park-n-rides, there does not appear to be signage letting them know that they can park free for 24 hours if they are in the district.  He believes we need to communicate this in a more visible way.
