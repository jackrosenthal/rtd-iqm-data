BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 3, 2013

From:

William Van Meter, Assistant General Manager,
Planning

GM

Date:

July 2, 2013

Board Meeting Date: July 11, 2013

Subject:

2013 Title VI Service Monitoring

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors review and approve the
2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with
federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI). Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin from
recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc...). RTD complies with Title VI by
committing to the following guiding principles:
1. Ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. Preserve the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services, providing equal access for any
person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. Create opportunities for the public to participate in transit planning and decision-making without
regard to race, color or national origin;
4. Select the location of transit services and facilities without regard to race, color or national origin;
and
5. Take prompt and immediate action to correct and remediate disparate impacts borne by any
group of people of a race, color, or national origin.
The Title VI Service Monitoring Program is one of the mechanisms used to follow these guiding
principles.
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, as an operator of 50 or more fixed route vehicles in peak service, which is
located in an urbanized area, RTD is required to monitor the application of its service standards and
policies with respect to fixed route service. To determine if service standards and policies are adhered to
indiscriminately, the service provided to minority populations is compared to service provided to nonminority populations as required by FTA guidance. The 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results report
describes the scope, method and results of RTD’s Service Monitoring. The FTA also requires transit
providers to officially establish the frequency in which Title VI Service Monitoring will occur. Future Title

Packet Pg. 4

2.11.A

VI Service Monitoring will occur and be reported annually, as a part of the Service Performance Report
presented by Service Development.
The highlights and action items resulting from the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring are summarized in
the presentation attached to this board report. The full report is available separately in the Board Office
for review.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and annual monitoring frequency do not
result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board
of Directors review and approve the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future
monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
2) Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as it could jeopardize current
and future federal funding.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 3, 2013

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: July 11, 2013

Subject:

2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
The SBP provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2014-2019 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2014-2019 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2013 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
July 9th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on July 16th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2013 Amended Budget. The column titled “Amended Budget 2013” in Exhibit I incorporates
revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 18

2.12.B

The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School, and reductions, eliminations or deferrals of
SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $113.7 million in 2014 is forecast to decrease by $2.4 million
from 2013 due to transfer of revenue (and ridership) from bus to the West
Line. This represents ridership revenue that West Line has gained and bus has
lost. In future years, fare revenue includes a 10% farebox rate increase in
2015 and 2017 per Board policy of an optional 10% fare rate increase every 3
years.
 Sales and use tax incorporates the June quarterly update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2013-2019.
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
recent congressional actions.
 Fixed guideway and capital maintenance grant revenue is increased at the area
CPI inflation rates (from the CLC) with a doubling of fixed guideway grant
revenue (additional $8.7 million) in 2014 resulting from the seven-year
operating anniversary of the Southeast corridor.
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates of 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in
2015-2019. Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated
amount through 2017 then escalated at the CPI rate.
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base
System, will be held at the 2013 level in 2014, and beginning with 2014 increased
by the CPI rate serially each year.
 Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects are included (Exhibit III).
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in
investable balances.
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each
year by using amortization tables. Projected interest payments on future debt issues
are based on current municipal rate forward curves. Interest payment assumptions
incorporate recent upticks in interest rates on the forward curve.
 Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects
and replacements (Exhibit II).
 Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund, staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and/or capital
replacement fund be maintained at a minimum $3.0 million each year until each fund
reaches the minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur no later than
2019. During 2017, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to reach
$30 million.
 Contributions to fund balances include the Base System’s FISA contribution from sale
of Civic Center air rights.
 Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition. Debt
payments are derived from debt amortization schedules.
 Non-cash items include the estimated year-end net pension obligation offset by yearend accruals.

Note: The CLC inflation rate (CPI) is 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in 2015-2019, while the national CPI (applied
to fuel) is 2.5% in 2014-2019.

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax
revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an
impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2014
budget period.
Current key financial indicators for the SBP are (in millions):

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2014-2019 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2014-2019 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2014 budget

Packet Pg. 20

2.12.B

process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2014 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2014-2019
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2014 budget process.

Per the U.S. Department of Transportation guidance and regulations, all recipients
of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 •and its related laws and regulations. As a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) submits an annual assurance
of compliance with Title VI as a part of RTD’s annual submission of Certifications
and Assurances, as required per 49 CFR part 21.7. Accordingly, RTD’s Planning
Department will review the district’s services in its entirety for compliance with
Title VI. This review will include a review of the Strategic Budget Plan as
necessary, pursuant to ensuring non-discrimination on basis of race, color and
national origin. Should any Title VI violations become evident, remedial and/or
mitigating measures will be developed to restore equity and achieve compliance
with Title VI.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 11, 2013

From:

Paula Perdue, Executive Director

GM

Date:

July 11, 2013

Board Meeting Date: July 11, 2013

Subject:

Approval of General Manager's 2014 Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s goals for 2014 as defined in the attached General
Manager Performance Evaluation Form.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee is working with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010 the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals will include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs at the beginning of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
salaried employee performance evaluation form that is used by the rest of the RTD employees. This
action item is to formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed these 2014 core and task goals with the General Manager and unanimously approved
them on 7/09/13 to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2014 and the five task goals for 2014 and the attached General Manager Tactical Plan for
2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to implementing this policy.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2014 goals. This will
complete the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager to revise the 2014
goals. This will delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear and documented process.
