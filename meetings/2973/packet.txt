BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Heather McKillop, Acting Interim General
Manager and CEO

Date: February 6, 2020

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

February 5, 2020

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

Subject:

Longmont Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his/her designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically, the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326
and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County and the City of Longmont have funded and managed the Longmont fare buy-up program
since 2014. RTD and Boulder County entered into this agreement in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the
300 series routes in Longmont with the objective of building ridership and increase mobility options for
low income riders. During 2013, annual boardings for the Longmont local routes were 156,863
boardings (Weekday and Saturdays). By the end of 2018, boardings increased to 613,280.
The City of Longmont has since taken over the funding and management of this agreement and would
like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for a period of two additional years. This contract
would be in effect January 2020 through December 2021.
DISCUSSION
Under this agreement, all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting one and all passengers will be required to
adhere to all RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct. This agreement will not include the FlexRide
or regional routes operating within Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont will continue to
perform the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of the RTD
Marketing Department. RTD staff will also continue to conduct regular meetings with the local
municipalities to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with this agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
During this 24-month agreement, the City of Longmont has agreed to pay RTD the projected fares in the
amount of $972,402. In addition, the city has agreed to reimburse the RTD fares for all Access-a-Ride
trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. The City and RTD have
agreed on a methodology to calculate the cost of the program to the city based on ridership in arrears.
There will be a termination clause in the contract that will allow either the City or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his/her designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of
the Longmont local fixed route services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically, the
300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a
period of two years.
2. Do not approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up. This course
of action is not recommended, as it will result in a loss of a program valuable to the City of
Longmont and Boulder County. Additionally, this program provides transportation access to the
low-income population in these area. Local ridership will be reduced as customers are charged a
fare and lose the ability to travel for free at any time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Heather McKillop, Acting Interim General
Manager and CEO

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 48
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his/her designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006
with Master’s Transportation for the purchase of forty-eight (48) Goshen/Rev Group cutaway buses to
be used for the Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $3,342,180.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services and Task
Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI).
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of forty-eight (48) additional Goshen/Rev Group cutaway buses. The
new buses will replace thirty-seven (37) 2014 model year Startrans buses used for Access-A-Ride
services, seven (7) 2013 model year Eldorado buses used for FlexRide services, and provide four (4)
expansion buses for FlexRide services.
DISCUSSION
The 2013 and 2014 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. The 2013 Eldorado buses are over 6.5
years old and average over 225,000 miles. The 2014 Startrans buses are over 5.5 years old and
average over 170,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for
the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2020 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen/Rev Group,
has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or
his/her designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with Master’s Transportation for the
purchase of forty-eight (48) Goshen/Rev Group cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $3,342,180.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of
Thirty-four (34), 40 foot Low Floor Transit
Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his/her designee, to exercise the contract option and amend
contract 19FK002 with Gillig LLC for the purchase of thirty-four (34) additional new 40 foot transit
buses and associated spare components, and extended warranties for a total price not to exceed
$16,650,480.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 5000 series Gillig 40 foot transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years
or 500,000 miles. The buses are 14 years old and have on average over 600,000 miles of stop and go
transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
This requested bus purchase is included in the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan.
On September 24, 2019 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 46 Gillig 40’ buses to
begin the replacement of the 5000 series Gillig buses. The original procurement was the result of RTD
Request for Proposal (RFP) 19FK002. Contract 19FK002 allows RTD options to purchase up to 204 40’
buses during the 5 year contract period. Pricing for option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus
an inflationary price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index”
(PPI) which is published monthly.
DISCUSSION
The 40 foot low floor buses are similar to those currently utilized at RTD with a proven seating layout
that is approved by the CCDC to maximize wheelchair passenger space. The buses are equipped with
clean diesel engines meeting the latest EPA requirements. Over the estimated lifetime of each bus,
emissions will be reduced by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases, 6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides (NO x) and
0.25 tons of Particulate Matter versus the engines in the current 2005 buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract is for the purchase of thirty-four (34) 40 foot transit buses, associated spare
components, and selected extended warranties not to exceed $16,650,480. Funding for this contract is
approved and available in the District’s 2020 Budget.

1.B.3

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval. Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s
approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or
his/her designee, to exercise the contract option and amend contract 19FK002 with Gillig LLC for
the purchase of thirty-four (34) additional new 40 foot transit buses and associated spare
components, and extended warranties for a total price not to exceed $16,650,480.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it
would result, at the very least, in a significant delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase
the cost of the project. This will result in an increase in ongoing maintenance costs.

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - January 2020 (4099 : Service Availability January 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.65% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in January 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (January) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:





January 2020 – 47.88 hours
January 2019 – 124.19 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 47.88 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 124.19 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in January were AB overloads, and planned
bus bridges.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.65% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 2,423 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 19,384 hours of service being provided
by a “6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 2,388 shifts, or approximately 18,735 hours of service, with operators working a
“6th day”.
