Recommended Action

Budget Actions for T2 and O and M Cost Model

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating
Reserve to the Planning expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the
Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan).
The Board
previously approved all funding for this contract last fall when they adopted the 2019 2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the $1,420,000 DRCOG Regional
Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December 2018. The funds are
being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be

replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant
funds received and local funds, which were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating
Reserve to the Finance and Administration expense budget for development of an
updated operating and maintenance cost model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan
effort. The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a
timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with local funds for
the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.
This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
