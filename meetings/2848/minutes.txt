Recommended Action
C.

Budget Actions for T2 and O and M Cost Model

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating Reserve to the
Planning expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the Transportation
Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The Board previously approved all
funding for this contract last fall when they adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial
Plan, with the exception of the $1,420,000 DRCOG Regional Share TIP funding approv ed
by the DRCOG Board in December 2018. The funds are being temporarily taken out of
the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended
Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant funds received and local funds, which
were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating
Reserve to the Finance and Administration expense budget for development of an

updated operating and maintenance cost model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan
effort. The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a
timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with local funds for
the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.
This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management

Director Broom made the motion to approve the
Budget Actions for T2 and O and M Cost Model.
