BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Authorization to Enter into a Contract with
Motorola Solutions for Purchase of Radios
(56DH012)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a $940,000 sole source contract with
Motorola Solutions(Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios and associated
equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will include an option for a 3-year extended
warranty.
BACKGROUND:
RTD uses a Motorola P25 digital trunked radio system for 2-way voice communications throughout the
district by many operational business units. This system was purchased as part of the Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Replacement Project in 2010.
RTD is opening several rail lines in 2016, including additional light rail service for the new R Line. As
such, there will be additional Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) and increased need for security and fare
enforcement officers. These LRVs and officers need radios to perform effectively. These radios are not
essential for the April 22nd launch of the University of Colorado A Line, but should be procured before
any other lines are opened.
Additionally, RTD’s Gunbarrel radio tower requires additional capacity. New repeaters are included in
this purchase to provide additional capacity. The radio combiner in this purchase is to replace a broken
combiner.
DISCUSSION:
As part of participation in the Public Safety radio network, all tower equipment is required to be
Motorola equipment to maintain system consistency of operations throughout the network. Additionally,
RTD currently has close to 3000 Motorola mobile and portable radios that were selected as part of a
competitive bid process. There would be additional costs for system keys, programming cables,
programming software and training associated with procurement of other radio brands. Therefore,
subscriber radios will have a higher operating cost than the recommended Motorola Radios. Additionally,
the network equipment on the public safety radio system RTD uses is manufactured by Motorola. It is
required that the network equipment remain Motorola for effective management of the network and as a
requirement of the Consolidated Communications Network of Colorado (CCNC), the managing
organization for the radio network.
RTD, as a political subdivision of the State of Colorado may buy equipment off of the existing,
competitively-procured Western States Contract Alliance (WSCA) Public Safety Communication
Equipment contract. A sole source justification memo to use the competitively-procured WSCA contract
has been approved.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the subscriber radios is funded in the 2015 capital budget. The tower radios are funded
from the Radio-CAD/AVL budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a $940,000 sole source
contract with Motorola Solutions (Motorola) for purchase of mobile, portable and tower radios
and associated equipment (Contract Number 56DH012). This contract will include an option
for a 3-year extended warranty.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Motorola
Solutions to purchase needed radio equipment. This action would result in RTD’s inability to
effectively supply security officers with needed radios, provide additional needed capacity for
tower sites, repair a tower site with faulty equipment and provide some of the radios
necessary for the opening of the R line. This is not the recommended action.

Parking Management
Facilities

Extended

to

New

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to include new parking facilities in the Parking Management Program.
BACKGROUND
The Board-approved 2008 Parking Management Program was implemented in 2009 under constraints
imposed by the Colorado State legislature that limited which patrons can be charged for parking to, (1)
out-of-District patrons every day, (2) in-District patrons after the first 24 hours, and (3) reserved parking
in exchange for a flat monthly fee. Patrons may pay for parking at pay stations with exact cash or
credit, with pay-by-phone or with an “automated” account (pre-arranged, declining balance, 15%
discounted), or in-District patrons may subscribe to the Reserved parking program which reserves them
the right to access parking in a designated pool between 5am and 10am each weekday. After 10am
unused spaces may be used by any patron (at facilities where Reserved demand exceeds the legislated
maximum of 15% of each facility’s capacity, a waiting list is created). Approximately 18% of RTD
boardings result from patrons who park at RTD facilities and about 15% of those who park actually pay
for parking in one form or another.
At the time the Program was adopted approximately forty (40) parking facilities were included in the
Program, referred to as “designated facilities”. In November of 2012, when parking management
contract amendments were being considered by the Board, the new West Corridor parking facilities were
“designated” for inclusion in the Parking Management Program. That was the first major addition to
“designated facilities” since adoption in 2008. Prior to that time minor deletions, based upon unique
circumstances, had occurred as provided in the original Program. With various deletions, closings and
the addition of West Corridor, the Program currently is implemented at 36 RTD operated facilities.
DISCUSSION
In 2016, consistent with our practice of implementing the Program in all parking facilities in a corridor,
we plan to add the parking facilities in University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line that will
add 14 new parking facilities, 3 of which may be operated by others depending upon the outcome of
negotiations. In accordance with the existing contract, SP+ (formerly Central Parking) will purchase the
pay stations and other necessary equipment to manage these facilities and will recover the cost from
parking revenues.
After review of how facilities are included in the Program, the General Manager, as an alternative to
seeking Board approval on a case by case basis, believes the Board may agree that it is more efficient to
grant the General Manager broader authority to include new parking facilities in the Parking Management
Program as deemed appropriate consistent with size, location, ownership, stakeholder participation and
shared use considerations. This would align inclusion of parking facilities into the Parking Management
Program with the timing of planning and design of parking facilities.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Addition of these 2016 facilities will increase annual parking revenues and will capture a greater portion
of extended parking beyond the first day by DIA travelers. Operating expenses are recovered from
revenues.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking facilities in the Parking
Management Program.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action. Authorize the General Manager to include only new
parking facilities in the Parking Management Program that are planned to open in 2016, as
mentioned above.

2016 Title VI Program Update

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the 2016 Title VI Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI), as a condition of federal financial assistance. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, color and national origin from recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc.).
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients, RTD is required to submit a Title VI Program Update every three years. The Title VI Program
Update details the manner in which RTD intends to achieve compliance with the following objectives of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
1. To ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. To ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are sufficient to provide equal
access and mobility for any person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. To ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decision-making are
provided to persons without regard to race, color or national origin;
4. To ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are made without regard
to race, color or national origin; and
5. To ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken to prevent disparate impacts borne by any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.
The update itself includes an Executive Summary and is an attachment to the board report. The
appendices of this document contain a high volume of pages (over 300), thus the appendices will be
made available separately in the Board Office for review.

1.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2016 Title VI Program Update does not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the recommended action by the Operations and Customer Service Committee. It is
recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the 2016 Title VI Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
2) Do not accept the recommended action by the Operations and Customer Service Committee. This
action is not recommended as it is against federal law and would jeopardize current and future
federal funding.

MAY 2016

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit service
in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects
of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed
and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to
environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial
assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in
the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order
12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission
by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of
its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI
Program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
In this Title VI program update, the Transit Oriented Communities Division has compiled a documentation of
compliance efforts made from June of 2013 – June of 2016. Below is an overview of the collection of
documents and information that comprise the 2016 Title VI Program Update.

Demographic Profile Maps and Customer Satisfaction Survey data included as appendices to this document.

Complaints
Federal recipients are also required to directly accept, log and investigate complaints of discrimination.
Further, recipients are required to notify the public of their right to complain and the procedures for
processing their complaint. In the appendix is a copy of the Title VI public notice placed on all RTD vehicles,

Title VI Program Update

Subrecipient

The RTD Title VI Manager will ensure the following actions are taken affirming that RTD and its sub-recipients
comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B:
1. Each year sub-recipients must provide RTD with an FTA Civil Rights Assurance/Signed Assurance that
all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have been or will be
compiled, as appropriate, and maintained;
2. Each sub-recipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD with a list of active
lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color or
national origin;
3. Each sub-recipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent, conspicuous and accessible
locations throughout its facilities;
4. Sub-recipients must take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services,
information, and other important portions of their programs and activities for individuals who are
Limited English Proficient (LEP).
In general, sub-recipients should have a public participation process that offers early and continuous
opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic, and environmental impacts
of proposed transportation decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement
activities can include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices at all stations and in all
vehicles, and measures targeted to overcome linguistic, institutional, cultural, economic, historical, or other
barriers that may prevent minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a recipient’s
decision-making. Sub-recipients must file with RTD documentation of its public participation plan.
Each sub-recipient further agrees to comply
with, and assure compliance by its third party
subcontractors at any tier under the Project, with
all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program
pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B and 49 CFR
21.5(b)(2) and 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), Appendix C
to 49 CFR Part 21.

RTD’s sub-recipients of federal financial assistance must also comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. To meet its enforcement responsibilities under Title VI, RTD has implemented a sub-recipient monitoring
process.

1.B.3.b
Title VI Program Update

FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of Urbanized Areas with a
population of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service to ensure service is
provided accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective decisionmaking in the provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to ensure
service is provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Service is monitored by comparing a sampling of nonminority routes and minority routes, defined as 1/3 of revenue mileage borders census blocks with a minority
population greater than the service area average. No disparities were found during the transit monitoring of
this reporting period. The RTD service standards and transit monitoring results can be found in the appendix.

Fare and Service Change Equity Analyse s
The FTA requires RTD to establish policies that will guide the analysis to determine whether major service
changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Accordingly,
RTD established equity analysis policies and a service evaluation process to meet this requirement.

Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or
reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months.
All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes, but
is not limited to: eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an
existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population
is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a
disparate impact or a disproportionate burden,
RTD will consider modifying the proposed service
change. RTD will then analyze the modification and
make sure it removed the potential disparate
impact or disproportionate burden. If a less
discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD
can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed service change, the

FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.
The board approved policies can be found in the appendix.

This program update includes the results of both fare and service change equity analyses completed between
February 2013 and April 2016. Included with the results of each equity analysis are the proposed changes
and Board of Directors Meeting Minutes associated with the proposed change. Below is a list of each
proposed change that required an equity analysis during this reporting period:

Each proposed change and corresponding equity analysis can be found in the appendix.

CONCLUSION
During this reporting period, RTD performed extensive public engagement, completed several equity analyses
for major fare and service changes and found no probable cause in any official Title VI complaints. The
comprehensive analysis and monitoring efforts described in this document succeeded in promoting the
equitable provision of transit service in the Denver Metro Area. This snapshot summarizes RTD’s effort to not
only comply with the requirements of FTA Circular 4702.1B, but to advance social equity through policy and
public engagement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: May 19, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 18, 2016

Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

Subject:

August 2016 Service Change Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $1,085,400 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two grant funded proposals anticipated to be implemented in the August service change. Funded
through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate between the Central Park Boulevard Station
and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. Also funded through a CMAQ grant, enhancements to the frequency
of the Free Metro Ride operating between DUS and Civic Center Station are proposed. We will monitor
customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building and one meeting was held in
Longmont and one meeting in Commerce City. Comments and further details from these meetings and
the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose

Packet Pg. 39

1.B.4

modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2016 service change:
Route 62: Due to ongoing roadway construction, a detour routing will be necessary for the initial
months of this new service, as depicted in the attached map. The final routing for the route is also
illustrated on the same map for proposed Route 62.
Free Metro Ride: additional trips expanding the higher peak frequency period are proposed to further
enhance availability of service from Denver Union Station. The subsequent increase in cost is included in
the current proposal, which is fundable through its CMAQ grant.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: new grant funded route service between Central Park Boulevard
Station to 60th/Dahila.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale: add a 5:04am weekday and 5:39am weekend trips from Civic Center
Station to Nine Mile.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: shift 12:15am from 40th & Airport Station to 12:45am.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip
Free MetroRide: increase peak period frequency to operate every 4.5 minutes.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
BroncosRide and CU/CSU Game: discontinue BroncosRide and CU/CSU special service from the
Montbello park-nRide.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: cutback 2:57pm eastbound trip from Federal Center Station, to instead
originate at Lakewood Commons at 3:15pm.
Route 31 – Federal Crosstown: extend and convert a Route 30 trip to 72nd Avenue as a Route 31 trip
and shift the afternoon northbound school tripper.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown: convert 72W trips into 72 trips.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont: convert selected peak trips to become express trips.
Route CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver: convert one Route CV trip leaving Civic Center
Station into a Route CS trip.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 1 – 1st Avenue: running time analysis to improve on-time performance
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 16 – West Colfax: minor schedule adjustments
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: minor schedule adjustments
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road: running time and trip time adjustments
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments

Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Resume seasonal school service on the following routes:

Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F
(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $1,085,400 annualized, with
$1,039,200 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $46,200.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2016 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A Look Ahead – January 2017
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Boulevard
Due to the likely increase in ridership caused by extending the service to the Auraria Campus the peak
periods will have to be monitored for need of additional capacity.
E Line
Responding to recent growth on the E Line weekday midday period (9:30 AM-2:30 PM) warrants an
increase in service to provide 15-minute service.

Background
•

RTD’s Eagle P3 commuter rail project is governed by a Concession Agreement (CA) executed
in 2010 that includes a design-build phase and an operating period.

•

System performance standards are specified in detail and is contracted to Denver Transit
Partners (DTP), with DTP’s subcontractor Denver Transit Operators (DTO), responsible for
service, operations and maintenance performance and documentation.

•

RTD has six staff positions to oversee all aspects of the CA and they are based in the RTD
Rail Operations Department — staff are in both the Eagle project office and the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to facilitate interaction with multiple RTD departments and
concessionaire staff.

•

Numerous RTD Departments (Security, Finance, Service Planning, Capital Programs) also
provide support for system success.

•

The University of Colorado A Line opened on April 22 with robust service levels and increasing
ridership; two additional corridors, the B and G Lines, planned to open on July 25 and in the
fall, respectively.

Packet Pg. 49

Attachment: 2016 05 24 RTD Board Update Ops and Customer Service Committee (2808 : RTD Commuter

1.C.2.a

Oversight
•

The System Performance Demonstration (SPD) portion of Design/Build Phase initiated the
Oversight process, with staff from many RTD departments/projects observing train service,
vehicle, and facilities.

•

RTD Rail staff utilize a comprehensive Oversight Plan with CA-specific forms to record
observations, which may be conducted in the CRMF Shop/Yard, along the wayside, on-board
trains, and at stations and Park-n-Rides.

•

Availability Payments are pre-set over the term of the concession agreement and include
repayment of Debt and an Availability Adjusted Base Service payment, which includes a
performance adjustment.

•

Monthly invoices capture all required performance elements — DTP has 30 days to provide a
complete submittal, including Availability Factor, Performance/STOP adjustments, along with
records supporting these items.
– 2016 is a year of transition as the three Eagle P3 corridors are activated.

•

The oversight team reviews each invoice to confirm accuracy and compare data with the
observations made by staff during the month to validate the cost claimed.

Metrics
•

•

Availability is measured by three key areas:
– Rolling Stock Availability
• Scheduled trips/car hours, clean,
on-board systems working
– On Time Performance Availability
• Measured at time points and
terminals
– Station availability
• Clean, elevator operable
• Lights on, PA/VMS systems working
Performance is measured using STOP
points
– STOP points are accumulated if DTP
fails to perform prescribed maintenance
activities within defined time limits
• Graffiti cleaned, trash cans emptied,
elevators repaired

Commuter rail cars are being delivered four at a time from
Philadelphia and are undergoing static testing at the
CRMF.

• DTP and RTD staff have prepared for invoice cycles through
meetings and a draft sample submittal process, starting in
January 2016, to surface potential format or content issues
in advance.
• RTD team reviews for accuracy and verification of invoice
format and formulas
• RTD’s invoice review department team is as follows:
