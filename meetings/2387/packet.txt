2015 Year End Budget Transfer for Access-aRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the Via
Mobility budgets to the service line item of the Transdev On Demand budget to cover the variation in

in 2015. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $686,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, All Aboard Transit, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev On Demand, to provide Access-a-Ride
paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of the service providers (All Aboard, MV,
and Via) operate RTD-owned vehicles to provide the service. These vehicles are “dedicated” to the
provision of Access-a-Ride service. The fourth provider (Transdev On Demand) uses Transdev-owned
vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide the service. These vehicles are not dedicated to the provision of
Access-a-Ride service, but are also used to provide traditional taxi cab service. The current Accessa-Ride contracts were implemented in April of 2014 following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The
current Access-a-Ride service model is a change from the previous service model. Previously, the
service had been provided by four (4) providers (MV Transportation, Global Transportation, Horizon
coach Lines, and Via Mobility Services) all using RTD-provided vehicles.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the three dedicatedvehicle providers (All Aboard, MV and Via) were all planning to hire a portion of the operators that
were employed by Global Transportation. Due to ongoing Union negotiations at the time, the
providers were not able to specify the exact benefits that operators would receive once they
transitioned from Global to a new employer. As a result, a large number of former Global operators
decided to find employment elsewhere. From the onset of the contracts, the three dedicated vehicle
providers struggled to hire sufficient numbers of employees to meet the service demands. Despite
aggressive hiring campaigns, each or the dedicated vehicle service providers continues to request
limitations on the level of service that they are requested to provide. The combination of hiring
challenges due to the low unemployment rate, legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado, and
the ever increasing pattern of traffic congestion, forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center to assign more
and more service to Transdev taxi cab service. It appears that the forces working against the
dedicated vehicle providers being able to hire drivers, has not had the same limiting effect on the cab
industry.
The reliance on Transdev taxi service to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that the dedicated vehicle
providers have been unable to provide has resulted in an increase in the 2015 costs for Transdev and
a decrease in 2015 costs for the dedicated vehicle providers. Consequently, it is necessary to

Packet Pg. 50

1.C.1

transfer budgeted funds from dedicated vehicle providers budgets to the Transdev budget in order to
pay for service provided through the end of 2015.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Via service and fuel
budgets that can be transferred into the Transdev On Demand service budget.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for
Transdev On Demand service through the end of 2015.
2.

Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Transdev On Demand
service.

Subject:

Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with the Seniors’
Resource Center for the provision of the “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” contracted demand response transit
services. This contract is for three years with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount
includes $1,597,481 for service for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years
for a total amount not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract amount also
includes two (2) one-year options in the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel for a
total of $599,262 for option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for fuel for a total of
$616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five year period is not to exceed
$2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a total of $2,912,935. These costs are based on an
hourly rate and include estimated fuel costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will
reimburse the Contractor’s actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the most responsive
and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is
scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.
BACKGROUND:
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive, or “Call-n-Ride” service can
be described as shared-ride public transit service provided in a defined service area that requires that
the passenger contact the service provider to arrange for pick-up.
As a supplement to RTD fixed-route service, “Call-n-Ride” service has been operating in Evergreen
since March 2002. This service will continue to supplement and complement existing RTD fixedroute services operating in the area. The service area for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride can generally be
described as the same area as the Evergreen Metropolitan Water District.
Call-n-Ride service will continue to be provided on weekdays from 5:30 AM to 7:00 PM with two
vehicles serving the area. Saturday service will operate 9:00 AM TO 7:00 PM with one vehicle. No
service is offered on Sundays/holidays.

DISCUSSION:
One (1) proposal was received in response to Request For Proposals (RFP) 15DH099 for the provision of
the Evergreen Call-n-Ride demand response service. The proposal was received from the current Call-nRide Contractor, the Seniors’ Resource Center. The limited response to the RFP was primarily due to
two factors: 1) Because of the physical location of Evergreen, it may be impractical for other local
contractors to bid on a service that would require excessive deadhead; and 2) Potential contractors also
feel that it was impractical to try to supervise an Evergreen operation from Denver; locating on-site
operations in Evergreen would most likely be cost prohibitive given this size of the contract. The

Packet Pg. 52

1.C.2

Seniors’ Resource Center currently provides non-profit transportation services in Evergreen and has an
established operations center in the area.
It is the recommendation of the RTD staff that evaluated the proposal received in response to RFP
15DH099, that RTD award the contract for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride demand response services to the
Seniors’ Resource Center. This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposal according
to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established
for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b)
experience/qualifications (30%); and c) price (35%).
The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services, Pat Heye,
Alternative Service Planner and Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services. The Seniors’ Resource
Center (SRC) has been providing the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service since March 2002. SRC has provided
excellent service to the community as well as to the RTD. After reviewing both the technical and cost
proposals, it was the consensus of the evaluation team that the Seniors’ Resource Center presented an
acceptable proposal and offered a realistic price to provide the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of service under this contract are included in the adopted 2016 RTD budget.
Funds will be requested in future years’ budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to the Seniors’ Resource Center.
2)
Resolicit the provision of the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service.

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2015

Subject:

Approval of General Manager Authority
Regarding Eagle Project Operations and
Maintenance Annual Costs

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached resolution authorizing the Interim General Manager to execute all necessary work orders,
change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation
and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously
executed Concession Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors passed Resolution 10 authorizing the General Manger to
execute a Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project. The Eagle Project includes the East Corridor,
Gold Line and a portion of the Northwest Rail Line. A copy of that 2010 resolution is attached as
Exhibit A. The Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project extends to December 31, 2044 and includes
the design, construction, finance, operation and maintenance of the Project during that time period. The
authority provided by the Board in June 2010 allowed the General Manager to negotiate and execute all
necessary agreements, work orders, change orders and amendments for the construction phase of the
project in accordance with Resolution #10 and within the amount of $2.386 billion.
The attached resolution authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and execute all necessary work
orders, change orders and amendments for the operations and maintenance phase of the Concession, all
within the Board approved annual budget, and pursuant to any service changes authorized by the Board
for each runboard. Because capital expenditures are generally included in the annual budget and
programmed in the Strategic Budget Plan for years prior to approval, and the budget and runboard
changes are approved by the Board, this grant of authority will avoid the need for a separate Board
action for contract amendments or change orders to implement those Board approved expenditures and
changes.
DISCUSSION
Operations and maintenance of the Eagle Project is included in the Board approved Concession
Agreement. Payments for operation and maintenance are included in annual availability payments to be
made to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) under the Concession Agreement. A portion of each year’s
availability payment for operation and maintenance will be a part of the RTD annual budget. A portion

Packet Pg. 54

1.C.3

of the availability payment will be made directly by a trustee out of RTD sales tax receipts. Availability
payments under the Concession Agreement will commence in 2016.
It is anticipated that over time there may be a need to request that items serving the Eagle Project be
built or modified, and to modify service just as RTD monitors and adjusts all of its services to adapt to
customer needs. These changes will, if necessary, be negotiated as contract amendments, separate
agreements, or change orders with DTP or its subsidiaries. Each year staff will include the annual
appropriation amount of availability payments in the RTD annual budget, whether solely for the originally
contracted costs, or for additional capital or increased or modified service. Without the attached
Resolution, contract amendments, change orders or separate agreements in excess of the General
Manager’s Authority would need to be individually approved by the Board, in addition to the Board’s
approval of the budget and RTD service changes. Following approval of the budget and service changes
by the Board, staff will notify DTP and or its subsidiaries of such approval requiring them provide the
required commuter rail operations and maintenance, and any additional capital requirements for the
coming year. This process is clearly defined in the Concession Agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed within the budget approved by the Board for 2016 and each
subsequent year through 2044.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General
Manager to execute all necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with Denver
Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation and maintenance and any additional
capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously executed Concession
Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.
2. Decline the recommendation and require staff to seek approval each year or for each change
as frequently as may be required.

Date: December 3, 2015

Date:

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to enter into fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics for a new RTD
Trip Planner (15DJ005)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $763,757.00 fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) for design, development, testing, and release of RTD’s new Trip
Planner.
BACKGROUND:
Currently, trip planning is done by individual RTD riders through the RTD website by using a trip planner
powered by Google Transit and also internally by Customer Care agents using outdated TranStar
software. RTD (Customer Care and Marketing) has encountered a number of growing challenges:
 The two current solutions do not allow adequate flexibility to customize planning for a rider’s trip.
As an example, there are very limited means to set acceptable walk distances that meet RTD’s
standards or that properly define potentially hazardous physical boundaries.
 The current trip planners constrain RTD from making desired enhancements and customizations
that are now the standard of the transit industry.
 The two trip planners do not always provide the same itineraries for the same trip request,
resulting in conflicting schedules and routes that confuse would-be passengers.
 The current trip planner limitations result in a significant amount of unnecessary trip planningrelated calls directed to the RTD call center that impact wait times for customers who have other
information needs.
The purpose of this project is to implement a new trip planner that better meets the needs of RTD’s
Riders as well as internal Customer Care department:







To enhance the Trip Planning experience of riders:
o More options to plan trips (enter a stop, etc.)
o Permit users to explore, change, refresh, reverse, email, print, save trip plans etc.
o Accessible to all users with a wide-range of abilities.
To increase efficiencies and reduce the number of unnecessary trip planning-related calls that
come into the Customer Care call center.
To ensure that riders and Customer Care agents have quick access to the same trip planning
data.
To ensure that the trip planner product is flexible and can be customized and scaled to meet the
changing needs of our riders and RTD as an organization.
To reduce from two to one the number of trip planner tools utilized, funded and managed by
RTD.

Packet Pg. 71

1.C.4

DISSCUSSION:
In early 2015, RTD completed an extensive requirements gathering effort with product owners and IT
experts to identify the overall system requirements as well as what requirements could be met out-ofbox versus what requirements would have to be custom-developed.
After a lengthy analysis process, RTD has selected OpenTripPlanner (OTP) as the new trip planning
system for use by both Customer Care employees and our riding public. OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an
Open Source, Multi-Modal Trip Planning System (OS MMTPS) collaboratively developed by a team of
developers from across the globe and coordinated by TriMet, Portland’s transit agency. TriMet’s trip
planner, using Open Trip Planner can be found on their website here: http://trimet.org/.
As an open source product, there are no recurring software licensing costs or the attendant licensing
limitations to RTD. RTD will have access to the source code of the system as well as access to an open
development community. RTD and Cambridge Systematics will contribute back to the developer
community with ideas and new code development (as part of the open-source licensing agreement).
While the Open Trip Planner tool will provide significant, comprehensive functionality out-of-the box, it
will also require customized modifications to meet RTD’s specific and local needs – this development
effort represents a major component of the project’s budget and scope.
RTD’s Information Technology department does not have human resource capacity to develop and
configure the customizations in the timeframe required. Thus, a 3rd party software development service
provider with experience in developing trip planners with open-source products is required. The proposed
contract’s completion is eight months
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of the OpenTripPlanner development, warrant and support is $763,757.00. Funding
for this project is included in the 2015 SBP.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Cambridge
Systematics, Inc. to design, develop, test, and release a single new trip planner system that
meets both the needs of RTD’s riders and RTD Customer Care agents. This is the
recommended action.
2. Continue the use of the existing trip planner tools. This solution does not address RTD rider
needs, will continue to increase demands on Customer Services personnel and requires
ongoing resources and funding to support two separate systems.
3. Advance the development and configuration of the Open Trip Planner utilizing IT resources.
This would significantly delay the delivery of the planner and would require diverting already
busy IT staff from current priority projects.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: December 3, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 2, 2015

Board Meeting Date: December 8, 2015

Subject:

April 2016 Service Change

No action required, for information only.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. This
proposal is in concert with the implementation of the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and
Rail Service plan, already adopted by the Board in October 2015. The proposals included herein
(Attachment A) include a mix of service enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service
reductions, including the discontinuance of seasonal school related service. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Also included in this report is a proposal to reroute Free Mall Ride service from the 16th Street Mall on
weekends during the summer of 2016, as requested by the City/County of Denver (CCD). While this
should not be interpreted to be a part of staff’s draft service change recommendation at this stage of the
process, staff will also seek public feedback on the CCD request to divert Mall shuttle service off of the
16th Street Mall at certain times during the summer in order to better evaluate the CCD request.

Attachment A
Route 16 – West Colfax
It is proposed to discontinue service to 10th & Broadway. Trips currently originating or
terminating at 10th & Broadway will instead originate or terminate at Civic Center Station.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
This proposal extends weekday hours of operation by 3 ½ hours. Service would be
provided between 5:30am to 8:00pm rather than the current 6am to 6pm. Additionally,
Sunday service is proposed to be added from 8:00am to 6:00pm matching current
Saturday service levels (hourly). This proposal is funded through a Transportation
Improvement Plan grant and sponsored by the City of Longmont. Cost impacts covered in
the grant are estimated to be $171,000 annualized.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT
Routine schedule adjustments are anticipated with no cost impacts.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA
Re-route via Northwest Parkway and E-470 (as described and adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors in the US 36 BRT Service Plan). No cost impacts are anticipated.
Free Metro Ride
Contingent upon the availability of bus operators, this proposal increases peak period
frequency to service every 4.5 minutes. This increase would be funded through a
Transportation Improvement grant awarded for 2016. Anticipated cost impacts are
estimated to be $52,000 annualized.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride has not met
the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The Call-n-Ride currently has one all
day bus, 5:30am – 8:00pm. It is recommended to discontinue the Belmar Call-n-Ride.
Cost Savings are estimated to be $202,566 annualized, including fuel.

Grant (CMAQ) for an additional vehicle for an expanded Call-n-Ride. The service area
would be expanded to approximately 144th Ave to the north and to Zuni on the east. All
expenses will be covered under the grant. The Call-n-Ride is planned for a start date in

Improvement Grant (CMAQ) for a new Superior Call-n-Ride. The Call-n-Ride will operate
weekdays only 5:30am-7:00pm out of the US 36 & McCaslin Station with scheduled
meets. The Call-n-Ride boundary area will be approximately US 36 on the north, McCaslin
Blvd on the west, Interlocken Loop on the south and Interlocken Loop, including the
Flatiron Market Place on the east. The Call-n-Ride will operate 5:30am-7:00pm weekdays.
All expenses will be covered under the grant. The expanded Call-n-Ride is planned for a

Summary of City/County of Denver Request Regarding Free Mall Ride service
The City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Downtown Denver Partnership have
requested that weekend service (Saturday and Sunday) of the Free Mall Ride be placed on
an alternative path from Saturday June 4, 2016 through Sunday August 28, 2016 in order
to expand the Meet in the Streets (MITS) activities. Alternative service would be provided
on 15th and 17th Streets using the Free Metro Ride vehicles, as was done on five (5) select
Sundays in the summer of 2015. Please see the City of Denver request in Attachment B
for further details supporting the request.

Attachment: Attach A April 2016 (2623 : April 2016 Service Changes)

Golden Call-n-Ride
Due to a construction project at US 6 and 19th Street for a minimum of 18 months, the
Call-n-Ride will not serve the School of Mines Student Housing and reroute the flex route
away from US 6 and 19th Street during the period of construction. The new routing will
utilize South Golden Road and Ford St, coming in on 19th Street from the east to serve the
campus. No additional costs are anticipated.

Request for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016

CC:
FROM:
DATE:
RE:

The City and County of Denver's Community Planning and Development in association with the Downtown Denver
Partnership and the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District are formally requesting RTD provide
alternative 16th Street Mall shuttle service during multiple Meet in the Streets (MITS) events during the summer
of 2016. The Meet in the Street events would occur Saturdays and Sundays from the weekend after Memorial Day
until the weekend prior to Labor Day. This would be 13 consecutive weekends starting Saturday June 4th, 2016 and
run weekly through Sunday August 28th, 2016. Alternative Mall shuttle service would be provided on 15th and 17th
Streets in place of 16th Street.
This request will further The Mall Experience Project, one of Mayor Hancock's three initiatives to Activate Denver's
Urban Core. The project, led by the City of Denver in partnership with the Downtown Denver Partnership, aims to
guide improvements to the 16th Street Mall that will make it a better place for people. To achieve that, and with
the help of consultants Gehl Architects, we will be studying Mall activity and conducting public outreach to identify
ways to help the Mall reach its full potential as a welcoming place in the heart of our downtown. The 2016 MITS
events are one of several short-term recommendations made by Gehl in the report entitled "Downtown Denver
161h St Mall: Small Steps Towards Big Change" (draft report attached).
Key elements of MITS 2016 request:
•
Builds upon previous MITS events organized by the Downtown Denver Partnership in 2014 (2 events) and
2015 (5 events) that used the same alternative mall shuttle service.
•

Maximizes outreach, programming, and predictability for all users by occurring on a regular basis each
Saturday and Sunday during summer months.

•

Allows survey work during all MITS events, each with varying levels of activation in a more regular
occurring timeframe. In this case, "survey" means observation, pedestrian counts and man-on-the-street

•

Coordinates with CCD departments, DDP, and RTD to observe and measure the impact of MITS on the
multimodal experience on and in the vicinity of the 16th Street.

•

Fosters the strengthening of relationships with key downtown stakeholders that contribute to 161h Street
Mall being a world-class destination- a premier public space for people and an authentic Denver
experience. Potential stakeholder partnerships include Visit Denver, Colorado Rockies, Denver Art

intercept surveys.

Museum, etc.
We will work closely with RTD with all necessary communication, wayfinding, and outreach efforts regarding the
alternative mall shuttle service and other transit options before and during MITS 2016.

Impacts on RTD of 2015 Meet in the Street (MITS)

Cost neutral service delivery because we used the same number of vehicles and ran less frequently (4-6
minutes went to 18-20 minutes… we managed the service on-street to meet trains at DUS)
Ridership reduced from average of approximately 18,000 per average Sunday to approximately 5,800
per MITS Sunday

Option to maintain existing service frequency (4-6 minutes) on 15th and 17th

The diversion increases cycle time by approximately 14 minutes and increases required number
of buses from 10 to 14 per Saturday and/or Sunday… at a cost of approximately $4850 per day
or $126,100 for the 13 week period (26 days)

Service Performance 2014
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network to
accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus improving
performance and sustainability.

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed the 10% minimum/maximum
performance requirements for that service class. So this
is a case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective—maximize ridership within
the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy

per boarding. Efficiency—productivity or output/input—

is presented on the x-axis as boardings/vehicle hour.
Same boardings,
The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all
less subsidy
classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance.

Same subsidy,
more boardings

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the
green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.

Overview

Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Service Standards (under Reports).

 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, and tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings. Monthly pass
revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route. Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria
passes are allocated individually by the counts for each route weighted by the ratio of the class of service
fare to the local fare.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation
on all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting line items are assigned
to the most relevant variable.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Service Standards that the least productive 10% of routes based on either
subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing, revision or elimination, or if
both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the acceptable performance
domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each class of service. The calculation of
the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming the data have a normal
distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence intervals; however, the
standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the current year weighted
averages and standards by class of service.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides status as of November, 2015 listed in route number order.

Route 3 Ltd East Alameda — This is a well utilized route that easily meets the boardings per hour standard.
However, its subsidy per boarding is higher than most other CBD Local routes because the 3Ltd is a peak
period, peak direction only service and is thus more expensive to operate. Some efficiency measures are
planned with the opening of the R-Line in 2016.
Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor opening. Current ridership meets the
boardings per hour standard and is a little below the subsidy per boarding standard.
Route 26 West 26th Ave — New service introduced April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring. This route
easily meets productivity standard and is only slightly below for subsidy per boarding. It was recombined with
Route 28 28th Ave August, 2015.
Route 28 28th Ave – Current ridership meets the boardings per hour standard and is slightly below the subsidy
per boarding standard. It was recombined with Route 26 August, 2015.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – This route meets boardings per hour standard and is only slightly below the
subsidy standard. Duplication with the Route 40 on Colorado Blvd will be eliminated in April 2016.
Route 34 West 3rd Avenue Commuter —This is a small route that has been restructured several times in
recent years and serves passengers with disabilities. It was restructured again as Route 33 in August 2015.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch – Significant portions of this route are under development;
performance will be monitored. This route is barely below standards. It is proposed to be restructured as part
of the East Corridor implementation in April 2016.
Route 46 South Dahlia St — This route meets the subsidy standard, but ridership declined some and it does
not meet productivity standard. It will be monitored.
Routes 47X Green Valley Ranch/Montbello Express — This route was combined with the Route 48X Green
Valley Ranch Express for improved performance overall January 2012. This peak period only service will be
replaced by the University Of Colorado A-Line Line rail service in April 2016.

Attachment: Performance 2014 Complete (2620 : Service Performance 2014)

Route 1 West 1st Ave – Current ridership meets the boardings per hour (productivity) standard and is slightly
below the subsidy per boarding standard. This route will be monitored.

Route 54 Montbello Industrial Park — This route will be discontinued in April 2016 with the East Corridor
Service Plan.
Route 67 Ridge Rd – This route meets productivity standard, but not subsidy per boarding. Will be monitored.
Route 79Ltd – This route will be incorporated with Route 83L as 83D in January 2016.

Route 89 Stapleton/Anschutz Campus – This route was started January 2013 to serve new transitional housing
and in anticipation of the opening of the East Corridor rail services in 2016. In 2014 service was reduced by
half due to poor performance and ridership fell precipitously. This service will be monitored for rider response
after 2016.

Route 104X Commerce City/Denver Express – This was a grant funded service which began operating in
January 2013. A trip will be discontinued in January 2016 due to poor performance. Performance has
improved some and it is only slightly below standards.
Route 116L Ken Caryl Limited – Implemented with the opening of the West Corridor in April 2013. Will be
monitored.
Route 116X South Simms – Discontinued with the Route KC in April 2013 with the West Corridor opening, but
was returned immediately due to customer requests (Route KC was discontinued). Will be monitored.
Route 206 Pearl/Manhattan/Fairview High School — This route easily meets the subsidy standard, but does
not meet productivity standard. Service changes are planned for 2016.
Route 323 Skyline Crosstown — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013. Longmont Local routes became
free fare in July 2014. Will need to monitor and evaluate service options, especially if free fare is discontinued.
Route 327 Northside Loop Counterclockwise — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013. Longmont Local
routes became free fare in July 2014. It now meets the productivity standard. Continue to monitor.
Route 401 Ranches Crosstown — Discontinued midday weekday and weekend service west of Mineral Station
and replaced with S Jeffco call-n-Ride January 2012. Currently meets the productivity standard.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance has improved
somewhat. Meets productivity standard.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P
Parker/Denver Spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday.
Service was reduced to peak period only May 2009. Additional trips added January 2014 in response to public
meetings where constituents noted that this would make the route more attractive. In 2016 this route will be
combined with a portion of the Route 153 to form the new Route 483 Lincoln/Parker/Nine Mile with the
opening of the R-Line rail service.

Attachment: Performance 2014 Complete (2620 : Service Performance 2014)

Route 104 West 104th Avenue – Vehicle hours were added to this service to effect on-time performance,
resulting in a higher operation cost. Continue to monitor the ridership performance.

Route JUMP Boulder/Lafayette Via Arapahoe — This route easily meets the subsidy standard, but does not
meet productivity standard. It will be monitored.
Route DD Boulder/Colorado Blvd —This route was discontinued in May, 2015.

Route R/RC Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased modestly. Will
need to evaluate service options with the opening of North Metro rail in 2018.
Route T Boulder/Greenwood Plaza — This route will be discontinued with the opening of the Flatiron Flyer
services in January, 2016.

Belmar Call-n-Ride – In 2014 and 2015 service was reconfigured to discontinue the flex-route and serve Oak
rail station. Ridership will be promoted and monitored.
Evergreen Call-n-Ride – Ridership fell due to discontinuation of senior services. In 2015 a new shopping trip
was established and there will be further promotion.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride — It was proposed to discontinue service in 2009 and 2014; however, the RTD
Board chose, according to policy, to retain it due to lack of alternatives and the high proportion of riders with
disabilities. Reconfiguration and promotion in 2015 looks promising to improve performance.
Parker Call-n-Ride – The 2014 ridership performance slipped significantly; however, reconfiguration and
promotion in 2015 have brought it back up to meet minimum standards.
C-Line – This line only slightly misses the subsidy per boarding standard and easily meets the boardings per
hour standard.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
A new Call-n-Ride policy went into effect regarding how school children were scheduled for rides.
In the past, a ride scheduled from a school for one child, had other children getting on the bus all
going in the same direction. This practice evolved to the point where the Call-n-Ride bus was
scheduled at the school by RTD staff rather than an individual. While this approach provided a
reliable service for the children and good ridership numbers for certain Call-n-Rides, it created a
safety issue of having too many children on the bus at one time. The policy implemented for the
start of the fall school service was to have parents book their children’s rides. This new policy
resulted in frustrated parents calling in more complaints and less children using the service. We will
continue to monitor this issue.
Since the first Call-n-Ride went into service in 2000, the Call-n-Ride policy has been that if a
customer requests a subscription (ongoing) trip and it is available, the customer receives that trip.
There has not been an end date associated with the customer’s trip. With the advances in
technology and scheduling software in place, these never ending trips can cause scheduling issues in
the future because of the scheduling software dynamics. A new policy limits a subscription trip
being booked for 150 days. The customer must reapply for a new ride at the end of 150 days, and
if the request is available, a trip is booked.

Packet Pg. 161

1.D.5

In 2015, RTD staff started a program to evaluate each Call-n-Ride and make changes necessary to
make the Call-n-Ride more efficient and reliable. This process can cause some customers to lose
their scheduled trips. We are making every effort to work with these customers and give them
acceptable alternative trips if available. This process is being done one Call-n-Ride at a time.
All Call-n-Rides operate with a computer and scheduling software. The current computers in use are
old and this affects our Call-n-Ride operations. New computers are being ordered. The plan is for
these new tablets to be in place in January/February 2016.
A major issue for Call-n-Rides in past years has been customers who “no show” their ride. In 2015
we have tried to educate our customers and drivers as to the proper procedures for no shows. In
2016, RTD staff will continue to educate customers and if necessary suspend customers who
continue to disregard the need to contact the driver if they will not be using the service.

Belmar – The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
Light Rail service. The Call-n-Ride operated with 2 peak vehicles and one all day vehicle, weekdays
only. Over the past two years, the service has been changed in order to gain more ridership as it
does not meet the minimum of three boardings per hour. These efforts continue but if the numbers
do not increase, this Call-n-Ride will be recommended for discontinuance in the April 2016 runboard.
Evergreen – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school closed whose students rode CnR and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to evaluate the service and make
recommendations for change. As a direct result of the TAC, marketing has taken place, a shopping
trip created for the seniors and Call-n-Ride worked more with the school age children for school trips.
Federal Heights – This CnR was started in January 2012 with a CMAQ grant with the local share
funded by Federal Heights (no RTD funds). RTD recommended discontinuance of the CnR in January
2015; however, the community and RTD agreed to keep the CnR for 1 year at a 50% cost share to
each party. In 2014 an advocate started teaching seniors how to use the CnR. This has worked and
ridership began rising in 2014. RTD worked with the communities and Water World in providing
service for the employees. Ridership will be evaluated in Jan/Feb 2016.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Rte 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to
Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch will cost share with the RTD
for 50% of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC has come up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015
runboard. Ridership will be evaluated in Jan/Feb 2016.
Longmont- while the weekday ridership meets productivity standards, Saturday and Sunday service
will be reviewed in Jan/Feb. 2016

Packet Pg. 162

1.D.5

Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership. The TAC has
come up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard. Ridership will be
evaluated in Jan/Feb 2016.
South JeffCo- changes have been implemented in this call-n0ride service recently in an attempt to
improve service reliability and customer service. In addition, while weekday service meets
productivity, Saturday service will be evaluated in Jan/Feb 2016

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: November 30, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 30, 2015

Board Meeting Date: December 8, 2015

Subject:

Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Update

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 3% through the 3rd quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of
2014. Productivity decreased from 1.24 to 1.20 passengers per hour. During the same period, Accessa-Cab ridership decreased by 3%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 1%
compared to 2014. Total boardings increased from 667,368 total boardings thru Q3 of 2014 to
687,209 total boardings thru Q3 of 2015.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 6% during the 3rd quarter of 2015 as
compared to the same period of 2014. Access-a-Ride is approximately 3% under budgeted revenue
hours through the third quarter of 2015.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2015 was 95.59% a slight increase as compared
to the same period of 2014 (95.10).
Passenger on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2015 was 84.40% an increase as compared
to the same period in 2014 (82.45).
On time performance continues to be challenging as a result of operator shortages and the continuing
trend of traffic, construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to address the operator
shortage challenge by continuing to utilize radio and billboards as a means of attracting potential
operators. In addition, their participation at job fairs have increased as well as their outreach through a
variety of print media.
Customer Complaints
Complaints increased through the 3rd quarter of 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Staff
continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2015

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2015 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles through the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to
utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 3rd quarter. First Transit Commerce City did not meet the goal however, all of the
five of the First Transit Commerce City passenger accidents that occurred in the 3rd quarter were
classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 3rd quarter. RTD and the contractor
organizations place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as
required, and as such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on
time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev and First Transit Denver, and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local OnTime Service with 88.3% and 88.4% and 88.3% on-time performance respectively through the
3rd quarter. First Transit Commerce City held steady during 3rd quarter with 83.5% on-time
performance. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with
low on time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis
contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss
factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance. Running time issues
are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

1.D.7



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls through the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in
this area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a
timely manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a
pro-active approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding through the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address
customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a
coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted
above regarding on-time performance should help address some customer complaints. The
contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety
meetings.

Complaint

Analysis

3rd

Quarter

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2015. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2014.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and, in 2013 and 2014, stricter enforcement and revisions
of the priority seating area policy which advised passengers with strollers or other large items that they
would need to move from the priority seating area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers.
In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the
requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for operators to call out transfer points. Following the
implementation of these policies/procedures, customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011
and 2012 RTD and the private contractors performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004
complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012, the performance goal for passenger complaints was
adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account
for the static higher level of complaints due to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare
enforcement campaigns, TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service.
The goal for 2015 remains at .0004 complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 3rd Quarter of 2015, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver and Transdev (formerly Veolia)
had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private
contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the
private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 181

1.D.8

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2015, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2015: the complaints in this category increased 7.6% compared to the
same period in 2014. In many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category for 2015 is 5.2 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 4.8 complaints
per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 5.2% compared to the same period
in 2014. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are

Packet Pg. 182

1.D.8

addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2015 is 5.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014
was 5.2 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 1.2 % compared to the same period
in 2014. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of
passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time
issues. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 12.3 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2014 was 12.4 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 9.2% compared to
the same period in 2014. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 5.2
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 4.7 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 6.1% compared to the
same period in 2014. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.9 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2014 was 11.2 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 2.2% compared to the same
period in 2014. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 0.32 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2014 was 0.33 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 13.3% compared to the same
period in 2014. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares
to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers
presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare
policies. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 1.0 complaint per day. The comparable number
for 2014 was 1.2 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 1.3% compared
to the same period in 2014. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is
8.2 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 8.3 complaints per day.

1.D.8

Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category decreased 11.6% compared to
the same period in 2014. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with
up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average
in the category for 2015 is 0.42 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2014 was 0.47
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2015: complaints in this category increased 6.4% compared
to the same period in 2014. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm buses are on
route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when
the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (111 of the total 3,152 = 3.5%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2015 is 11.6 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2014 was 10.9 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

3rd Quarter 2015 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of July, August and September. These
tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion
rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.

Packet Pg. 187

1.D.9

Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have
the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the
bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Proposed 2016 Internal Audit Plan

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2016.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the internal
audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit plan
and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of twenty (20) audits are planned including
IT audits. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

2.

This will allow the

Do not approve the proposed plan. This is not recommended. The plan was developed including
input from numerous sources throughout the District and also includes the audits annually
required by the Board. Delaying the start of audit work will limit the days available for fieldwork
and could require a reduction in overall audit presence in the District.

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2015. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance
measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in their entirety in the third quarter vs. 19 in the
second quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 1.1 – Safety Incidents
First Transit-Commerce City was the only carrier to not meet goal in Q3 in the passenger accident
ratio per 100,000 miles. All of the passenger accidents were non-preventable.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q3; performance is slightly
lower and essentially stable from Q2. In Local on-time service, all carriers met goal except RTD
Local and First Transit-Commerce City. Regional & Express on-time service showed the most
decline from Q2. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes
and identifying the resources needed to improve, such as service changes and further operator
training.
Light Rail on-time service showed a slight improvement over Q2 and exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
There was virtually no change to this measurement in Q3 from Q2. Overall system complaints
met goal, but individually, three carriers did not. We have seen customer complaints increase
across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, heavy/longer load times, TIC availability, SmartCards,
and the addition of West Line. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the
validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the valid issues.
In Q3, RTD and First Transit-Longmont met or exceeded goal while First Transit-Commerce City,
Transdev and First Transit-Denver did not meet goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as
part of the Operations/Customer Services report.
5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance

Packet Pg. 203

3.C.1

Access-a-Ride on-time service was only slightly down from goal of 96.0% in Q3, mostly due to
challenges in operator hiring.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership in Q3 is only slightly below goal by less than 1%. Ridership goal is 0% increase for
2015. Ridership actuals compared to budget will continue to be evaluated.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus operators and bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high level
of vacancies in this category and recruitment is on-going. Human Resources has revised its hiring
practices to include signing and referral bonuses, “one-stop” job fairs, the use of outside agencies, and
advertising. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local economy.

-

(1) The majority of debt interest payments occur on December 1st therefore variance will correct by year end
(2) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan (TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn) and issuance of 2015 COPs.
(3) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(4) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(5) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
(6) Decrease will be replenished with draws on Bond and COP project funds at year-end

SALARIED EMPLOYEES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AUDIT
HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #15-01-03

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
There have been several iterations of the Salaried Employees Policies and Procedures between
2006 and 2015. They became less specific containing less detail and were changed frequently
without Management or staff knowledge. The “Employee Guidelines” depended on Human
Resources interpretation more and more in recent years. In addition the Guidelines were in
several parts including:







Part 1 – General Guidelines applicable to all employees,
Part 2 – Guidelines for Salaries Employees.
Procedures Manual
Compensation Manual
Total Rewards Binder and
Several HR forms on the HUB also contain procedures.
SCOPE

The scope included review of the policies and procedures that relate to Salaried Employees.
This involved reviewing previous versions of the policies and procedures and those relating to
Represented Employees for comparison purposes.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the audit was to review the policies and procedures for Salaried Employees
and determine whether they were comprehensive, relevant, fair to all employees, accessible,
and included all relevant sections.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following:
1. Obtained and reviewed the policies and procedures for Salaried Employees including
older versions as necessary.
2. Obtained and reviewed the policies and procedures for Represented Employees.
3. Interviewed staff to provide further information where needed.

CONCLUSION
The current “guidelines” for salaried employees are not comprehensive. They are located in
several different manuals and forms, and there is inconsistency in topics. The guidelines are not
up to date, and where they are, management and staff are not informed of the changes. There
is no evidence of segregation of duties between writing, reviewing, authorization and approval of

Attachment: FAAC December 2015 (3rd Quarter 2015) with attachments (2626 : Third Quarter 2015 Internal Audit Report)

3.C.3.a

the Guidelines. In many areas, the guidelines provide no direction and no specific policy
information. Employee guidelines do not encourage, support or facilitate accountability and they
do not accommodate the identification of violations. They are deficient in internal controls and
prepared on an adhoc basis - when policies and procedures were requested by Internal Audit
they were written by HR staff and presented to Internal Audit.
Internal Audit’s concludes that RTD should review and revise the current “Guidelines” as soon
as possible. Policies and procedures should be developed and implemented that would provide
clear policy and direction in the form of comprehensive written procedures. The policies and
procedures should include clear lines of authority and responsibility involving the General
Manager and CEO, and the Senior Leadership Team. The policies and procedures should be
formally reviewed and approved by the General Manager and the Senior Leadership Team.
Updates and changes to the policies and procedures should be actively communicates to staff.
Written policies and procedures should enable the users (management and staff) to understand
their roles and the actions available to them. They should facilitate continuity and comparison of
actions taken by management in similar situations. In addition, the policies and procedures
should accommodate the identification of violations and provide consequences for violations.
Policies and procedures dictate how the organization will function; they provide the methods for
conducting business and support the purpose and mission of the organization. Policies and
procedures should be developed with this in mind.
CURRENT STATUS
The CFO and AGM Finance and Administration has been working diligently to develop
comprehensive policies and procedures. The policies and procedures will be available for
review by Management early in 2016. Internal Audit will follow-up, to ensure they contain
sufficient internal controls and are applied as prescribed.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Per the RTD “Adopted Budget 2015”, there are eleven Departments, with numerous Divisions
included within those Departments. Each Division generates their own expense budget for the
year. Total ‘Non-Bus’ and ‘Non-LRT’ Operating Expenses, per the approved 2015 Adopted
Budget, are approximately $206 million.
The annual budget process generally starts late in the 2nd quarter of the current year, in
preparation for the next calendar year. The complete RTD budget is expected to be finalized
during the 4th quarter, and is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.
AUDIT SCOPE
The audit concentrated on the preparation and ongoing monitoring of Non-Bus and Non-LRT
expense budgets within RTD. Internal Audit utilized the approved 2015 budget package for
review and testing.
CONCLUSION
Management will provide additional training for various RTD department personnel to
understand how to efficiently access their YTD Budget vs. Actual Expense spreadsheet, and
how to research General Ledger activity in Oracle to validate the propriety of recorded
expenses. In addition, budget employees within the Finance Division, will ensure that ‘variance
analyses’ are distributed to appropriate individuals in a timely and consistent manner after each
quarter end.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE REVIEW
2015 INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 15-10-05
BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses, and
train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Affiliated Computer Services, a firm purchased by
Xerox with previous expertise in developing such systems, has been working with RTD since
2011 to implement all aspects of this project. The RTD Board approved a contract increase with
Xerox Transport Solutions in 2014, which raised the estimated external project cost to $19.7
million. This increase also included required equipment for new Light Rail (LRT) and Commuter
Rail platforms, related to planned system expansion in 2016.
Since 2013, efforts have concentrated on developing a system that will allow passengers to
purchase credit as ‘stored value’ on their Smart Card, which will then be reduced when the card
holder ‘taps on’ to ride an RTD bus or Rail vehicle. Security Officers will be utilized to
periodically test LRT riders’ cards to verify that they have ‘tapped on’ and have not exceeded
their ‘paid-for’ trip length. Stored Value capability was planned for mid-2014, but later postponed
until August 2015. However, implementation of Stored Value has now been delayed until 2016.
AUDIT SCOPE
Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle approach, our participation in 2015 has continued to
include a review of the development procedures being used to build a system that will satisfy
the needs of the District. Internal Audit has also monitored activities to ensure new capabilities
are adequately tested in advance of moving into a live, full production environment.
CONCLUSION
During 2015, the RTD Project Team has continued to work with Xerox in an effort to develop the
electronic fare media system that was originally anticipated. However, as noted above,
problems and setbacks have been experienced and the goal to ‘go live’ with Stored Value
capability has now been postponed until 2016.
The use and monitoring of Hand Held Security Devices utilized by Security Officers to test Light
Rail patrons’ MyRide cards and ensure accurate recording of their trip, has not met original
expectations. In addition, this equipment will no longer be supported by the manufacturer.
However, an alternative solution with additional cost, has recently been identified for 2016
implementation.
Pilot testing is continuing to validate that MyRide tapping data is accurately uploaded to
Revenue Reports which will be utilized to post related entries to the General Ledger in the live
environment.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review as Internal Audit continues to be involved with the Project Team.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
The WIN Program (Workforce Initiative Now) began in August 2011 and was initially funded by
a Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Innovative Transit Workforce Development Program
Grant in March 2011. The WIN Program’s collaborative approach to partnering leverages
existing providers to asses, train, and place community members into careers.
The WIN Program is led by RTD in coordination with the Community College of Denver, Denver
Transit Partners, and the Urban League of Metropolitan Denver. A recent renewal grant was
received from the FTA and provides approximately $660,000 covering the next two years for
WIN general operations, training, personnel, and related projects.
Per internal reporting, since 2011 the WIN Program has served over 1,500 individuals in career
explorations, job skills training, and placement. The program has placed over 600 participants
with more than 30 different employer partners, from small businesses to large contractors.
AUDIT SCOPE
The scope of our audit concentrated on reviewing the WIN Bowling Tournament/Fundraiser
event held in November 2014 to ensure proper planning, execution, and post-event evaluation.
We also reviewed inventory controls over supplies provided to successful candidates, ensuring
adequacy and proper tracking.
CONCLUSION
Future Fund Raising events will include improved financial reporting at their conclusion to
document a detailed Budget vs Actual analysis and variance explanations. In an effort to reduce
costs, the use of a contracted Event Planner will be reconsidered if any future similar events are
held. Management has created a more complete perpetual inventory tracking of boots, vests,
and other construction supplies to indicate which WIN participants such items are provided to
and identify when re-orders are necessary.
CURRENT STATUS
A ‘final’ Budget vs Actual analysis has since been prepared and a new inventory tracking
system is in place. No new fundraising events are currently planned.

Information

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for
transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards
encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit
card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is
less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card.
We are targeting January 1, 2016 for the Stored Value public pilot go-live which will include:
 Up to 5,000 customers will be selected to participate, participation will be staggered
 Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets
 Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
 Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
 Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses
