rights associated with the building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza, 1560
Broadway, City and County of Denver, Colorado 80202 for $8,100,000.
Motion:

Director Cohen made the motion to
forward this item to the full board
at the November 27, 2012 Board
meeting.
Director McMullen seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Cory Granrud and John Shonsey made the presentation. This would be
the first hard cash to go into the capital account if approved by the
Board. Civic Center Properties LLC has reached the point where they
have to refurbish the building and have approached RTD to buy the
rights, this does not include the subterranean parking garage or the Civic
Center bus facility owned by RTD. RTD staff received two appraisals
the first one by Cushman & Wakefield of Colorado, Inc. for $7.5 million
and the second by Integra Realty Resources their appraisal came at
$8,700,000. They took into account the $400,000 annual rent payment.
At the end of the lease, the building would be beyond its economic
useful life of 55 years. In terms of the profit staff anticipates that $5
million would go into the internal savings account and the rest towards
the Northwest Area Mobility Study.
Director Hoy asked if the building that RTD is in now is part of the
improvement in RTD’s air rights and who owns this building. John
responded that the building belongs to Civic Center Properties. Director
Hoy asked if once we sell the building we would have to pay rent to
them. John clarified that we are paying rent right now. We will only sell
the air rights not the other areas. Director Hoy asked how the study is
going to be paid for if the building is not sold. John stated that the staff
has identified other sources, but this way they would not have to touch
other funds.
Director McMullen asked if RTD owns the whole block. John responded
that approximately half the block is leased to RTD on a 100 year lease
but it is actually owned by a trust that is managed by Wells Fargo. The
part to be sold would only be the air rights for the building itself.
Director McMullen asked why we had not sold these rights before. Rick
Clarke explained that the owner is looking to make some upgrades so it
has become more compelling to them. Director McMullen expressed that
he will support the sale of the air rights.
Director Deadwyler requested clarification about the study and stated
that since the capital account has not been approved, the assumption

that part of the profit would go into it seems premature. John explained
that the study is the Northwest Area Mobility Study. With regard to the
account, if the Board approves the account the money will go to the
account. If it is not approved, the money would go somewhere else.
Director Deadwyler expressed that she was confused because she
understood the Study had been approved at a previous discussion today.
Bill Van Meter explained that the discussion was on the MOU that was
sent to the stakeholders, but the study itself had not been approved at
this meeting.
Director James expressed that there is a good change that he’ll vote
against this and asked who the client was for the appraisals. John
stated that they were done for the Civic Center Properties. Director
James also requested a more detailed map of the property. Director
James summarized the prospective sales as a bundle of rights to a
company where RTD is going to receive $8.1 million. John explained
that the appraisals include improvements that the building would require
and that RTD would have to do once the lease ends. Director James
also expressed concerns about the rest of the block where the building is
located. John explained that the station is on land that is leased for 100
years. Director James asked if the staff has considered other
alternatives. John expressed that there is not much room, since there
are some views that have to be maintained. Director James stated that
the discussion has helped to change his mind and feel comfortable voting
yes on the proposal.
Director Daly stated that this is exactly what Phil was talking about
earlier tonight. This is the answer to our critics that say we are not
looking for every opportunity. He requested the staff to bring more
action items like this for future meetings.
Committee Chair Bagley requested clarification as how this was a good
decision for RTD since right now RTD gets $400,000 year on rent but
once the building is sold RTD will get nothing. John explained that at
the end of the 37 years RTD would still own the bus turn around, the
shuttle, the parking area and everything below the first level. Civic
Center Properties would have the right to do what they want to the
building. Committee Chair Bagley asked if there are any development
rights. John explained that the view corridor limits what RTD can do.
Committee Chair Bagley asked is the staff can look at any development
rights that could be transferred to another area. Staff agreed to look at
that but at this point nobody has address RTD with that interest.
Committee Chair Bagley also expressed that it would be valuable to have
a better map.
Director James stated that it would be useful to understand the air

rights. John stated that there is buildings envelope and they buy the
right to build inside that envelope. Director James agrees with
Committee Chair Bagley that it is worth it to see if there is a potential to
transfer rights.
Director Walker asked what the height limits are. John answered that
they are not certain about the height availability. There are some taller
buildings in the area, and they would have to look into that.

Vote on
Motion:

The motion passed with 12
members in favor (Anderson,
Bagley, Cohen, Daly, Deadwyler,
Hoy, James, Malpiede, McMullen,
Tayer, Tobiassen and Walker) and
0 against. Chair Kemp and
Directors Gore and O’Boyle were
absent.
Committee Chair Bagley declared
the motion PASSED unanimously.

Approval of Proposed Disposition Plan for 7500 East 41st Avenue, Denver, Colorado
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 8.06 acre RTD
owned property located at 7500 East 41st Avenue, Denver, Colorado, and further
authorize the General Manager or his designee to request, receive, and evaluate
proposals for the sale of said property.
Motion:

Director Cohen made the motion to
forward this item to the full board
at the November 27, 2012 Board
meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

John Shonsey explained that this is part of some buildings acquired by
RTD when they were trying to work with Union Pacific. UP had
purchased those buildings and they got transferred to RTD. One of the
first conditions of the purchase was to sell back to the original owner.
None of them are interested in buying it. The Board’s action is not for
selling it but to put on the market and receive and evaluate proposals.
Director Hoy asked how long it will be on the market. John stated that

Summary of the Planning and Development Committee meeting held on Tuesday, November

RTD will follow the RFQ process.
Director James asked if RTD owns other property adjacent to this. John
stated that the East Corridor has a connection but is not affected by this
sale.
Director McMullen reiterated that this property was acquired when RTD
was trying to establish the program with Union Pacific and UP bought
some properties. RTD took over the responsibility for some of this
property as well as another property in Weld County. John also
expressed that RTD had an agreement that if RTD was able to sell to the
original property owner, they would have to sell to them at the price that
Union Pacific paid for the property, but because it’s not being sold to the
original owner we can ask for fair market price.
Director Tobiassen expressed that when somebody is looking for
properties most of the time, they would go to a real estate agent. He
asked why RTD does this with an RFQ process. John explained that
Resolution Number 10, Series of 1984 says this is how RTD sells
property. He mentioned that this is also a special case because there
had been an unsolicited proposal received.
Committee Chair Bagley explained that when there is an unsolicited
proposal, RTD directives require RTD to go to a RFQ process.
Director Hoy stated that we need to address how to dispose the surplus
of properties. The staff provided a list of properties owned by RTD that
are vacant and underutilized.

necessary to award a contract amendment with Tsiouvaras, Simmons, Holderness
(TSH) in the amount of $4,500,000.00 for a new contract value in the estimated notto-exceed amount of $5,000,000.00 for the duration of the 5 year contract term.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the
motion to forward this item to the
full board at the November 27,
2012 Board meeting.
Director James seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

John Shonsey explained that in May of 2012 RTD awarded a contract
for on-call design services. This was to provide design work for what
had been identified in that year’s Strategic Budget Plan. Since we have
awarded that contract staff has identified additional project that they
would like TSH to assist with that are listed in the Board Report. In
order to pursue those projects the amount originally authorized in the
contract needs to be increased. These are work order contracts and not
a separate contract.

motion.
Discussion:

Committee Chair Bagley asked if the increase is due to an increase of
projects. John stated that the increase is from $500,000 to $5 million
