BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Community Value and Customer Excellence Surveys
Contract Award

June 5, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
June 27, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to enter into a
contract with ETC Institute for the provision of community and customer surveys. The contract is for
three base years, with two additional one-year options exercisable at RTD's discretion. The total not-toexceed cost for all five years would be $984,550.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting a five-year strategic plan, the Board established four strategic priorities and their associated
success outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Community Value: RTD Strives to be a strong
community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver Metro region
while sustaining planet Earth

Success Outcome

Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently
deliver high-quality customer service

Establish baseline for customer net
promoter score and increase by 5%

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and
retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce

Establish baseline for employee net
promoter score and increase by 5%

Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the
management of all financial resources

50% of outcome is that RTD
spends less money than it receives;
50% of outcome is that the
community believes that it sees
value in RTD’s spending

Establish baseline for community
value index and increase by 5%

Regarding the strategic priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence, a consultant was
engaged in 2021 to conduct community and customer surveys (surveys) to discern the agency’s
community value index and customer net promoter score (NPS) for that year. Those surveys were

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

completed November 2021 and the results were validated by a third-party auditor in January 2022. On
February 17, 2022, the 2021 survey results were presented to the Board.
The community value index and customer NPS garnered from the 2021 surveys serve as the baseline
data against which future progress is measured for the strategic priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence.
Culminating from a competitive request for proposals, a different consultant was awarded a contract on
August 3, 2022, to conduct the 2022 surveys for follow-on data. The instruments for both surveys
were based on those developed in 2021 to ensure consistency in data collection and reporting. On
November 2, 2022 the 2021 survey results were presented to the Board.
A summary scope of work (SOW) for the 2023 surveys was approved by the Board on March 28, 2023,
and included similar requirements as those in the 2021 and 2022 solicitations such as survey
methodology and instrument design, survey execution, results analysis and comprehensive reporting for
bus, rail and paratransit.
On April 6, 2023, RTD issued a request for proposals for community and customer surveys. The
solicitation was assigned a Small Business Enterprise (SBE) goal of 15% and was publicly advertised.
Following a 21-day solicitation period, five proposals were deemed responsive. A panel assessed the
proposals using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the
proposals, the panel recommended the contract be awarded to ETC Institute.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff’s recommendation is for the Board to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to
enter into a multi-year contract with ETC Institute for the provision of community and customer surveys.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the surveys is included in the 2023 Board-approved budget.

During the February 15, 2023, Performance Committee meeting, committee members reached a

Compensation Analysis).

processes for evaluating both the performance of the agency and the performance of the General
Manager and CEO.

Philosophy presentation from the Chief People Officer that will explain what constitutes said philosophy,
i.e., considerations, factors, types, and components.

What It Is

A compensation philosophy is simply a formal statement documenting
the company's position about employee compensation. It explains the
"why" behind employee pay and creates a framework for consistency.
Employers use their compensation philosophy to attract, retain, and
motivate employees.

The City’s total compensation for its employees endeavors to pay at least the market median for
comparably situated public employees.
The City’s goal is to move toward the market median for all classifications that are currently under
the market median. This total compensation should reflect the ability to: recruit, retain and engage
highly qualified employees capable of delivering a world-class public service to the community;
comply with public safety and regulatory requirements; and carry out critical infrastructure needs.
This total compensation should also reflect the ability over the long term to keep pace with economic
inflation through periodic wage increases based on cost-of-living adjustments (COLA). Compensation
should be data-driven to ensure internal and external pay equity.
The Compensation Philosophy should be reviewed periodically to make sure it continues to meet the
goals of the City.

RTD Employees (2023)
Be competitive with the external labor market both public & private. Our competitors in the marketplace are
other transit agencies and Denver-metro employers with similar business functions that can be identified as our
direct competitors for labor. We consider all the ways we compensate employees so that “total compensation”
(base pay plus benefits) is competitive at similar performance levels.
Consist of salary ranges determined by market data (external) and point factor analysis (internal). The
objective of RTD is to set salary ranges that reflect the market value of each position, attract and retain the
right talent to RTD, and recognize and reward results.
Reward results. Individual pay decisions are based on an individual’s results and their current salary range.
Be affordable. The District’s Board of Directors approves an annual budget that funds employee compensation.
Our goal is to ensure that all RTD employees be equitably compensated for assigned duties and responsibilities
without regard to race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, marital status, or sensory, physical or
mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation or any other basis of discrimination prohibited by local,
state and federal law.
