Committee Meeting Date:
December 2, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
December 7, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson’s attached
performance appraisal for the period of November 9, 2020 through November 8, 2021 (performance
period), and, in connection therewith, to approve a 6% total increase (3% Job Description Evaluation

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, Chair, General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (GMOC) is responsible for
oversight and management of the GM/CEO’s employment contract, compensation package, and annual
comprehensive performance appraisal. Following the GMOC’s consideration, the GM/CEO’s performance
appraisal and corresponding adjusted compensation are reviewed and approved by the Board.
On July 20, 2021, the Board adopted the “Third Amendment to Chief Executive Officer and General
Manager Employment Agreement”. This amendment states that beginning in 2022, the GM/CEO is
eligible for a performance-based Adjusted Base Salary increase up to six percent of her annual Base
Salary ($315,000.00). For the performance period only, the GM/CEO’s performance evaluation criteria
are based on the GM/CEO’s Job Description, which was developed by the executive search firm of
Krauthamer and Associates and adopted by the Board. The potential six percent base compensation
increase is derived in equal part based upon the GM/CEO’s performance meeting or exceeding the Job
Description Evaluation Criteria (three percent) and Job Description Personal Attributes (three percent).
Beginning in 2022, the GM/CEO’s performance will be measured using elements derived from the 20212026 Strategic Plan.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the third amendment, on November 10, 2021, GM/CEO Debra A. Johnson submitted a
self-evaluation for the Board’s consideration. All Directors were given the opportunity to submit ratings
and comments on GM/CEO Johnson’s performance during the performance period based upon the above
criteria. The attached appraisal reflects the Board’s assessment that GM/CEO Johnson has met or
exceeded all performance criteria and is entitled to an increase of 6% of her Base Salary beginning
January 1, 2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The General Manager’s anticipated Adjusted Base Salary increase is included in the 2022 Adopted
Budget.

Please provide any additional comments or reflections on how you perceive the
General Manager's performance in this area:
RESPONSEID

RESPONSE

37

She has cultivated a great senior leadership team.

45

I have had many meetings both internal and external with CEO Johnson and it is clear that
this is an area of expertise for her. She clearly continues to amaze the community with her
ability.

49

Debra has done a good job of assessing the organization and implementing changes to make
it more effective.

51

GM/CEO is a strong and experienced CEO and has done a lot of great work in her first year.
The APTA peer reviews, follow-up audit planning and safety and security work, the focus on
diversity and serving our core customers, elimination of mandating and signing bonus
programs, are a few examples. Others follow in other sections. In terms of optimizing the
use of resources and revenues, I believe additional planning needs to be done. RTD has
benefited and will benefit from some of the largest infusions of money in decades (or ever).
Scenario planning with the board about policy options for using these funds is critical. The
decision to shrink RTD's service is a policy decision that should be made with the board in
light of the needs of a state and world addressing the huge problems of climate change. In
terms of creating new sustainable revenue streams, state funding is critical to RTD's future.
See external relationships. With respect to communications and marketing, the sector
listening sessions are a good step. They need to be less about RTD presentations and more
about working with the staff and stakeholders and accepting real input into service
decisions.

52

General transit management is a real strength for the CEO. Ratings that take in multiple and
varied elements (unifier, integrator, team building, visionary mentor, and motivator etc.) are
difficult to score as a single entry. Here's what I've seen so far: strong hires, instances of
finding and correcting substandard practices (some we know of, others referred to but not
elaborated in conversations), thoughtful and directed organizational restructuring. In normal
times it would be more than enough, but the reality we're in calls for great creativity and a
can-do posture.

56

Debra is off to a good start, especially in light of extremely challenging circumstances. She is
an exemplary leader who prioritizes effectively and communicates professionally.

57

Ms. Johnson has proven herself to be a highly effective general transit manager. Ms.
Johnson is able to deploy her robust transit expertise effectively in large part due to her
strong leadership qualities. By unifying, integrating, and building up the RTD team and by
demonstrating a high level of accountability to the RTD team, she has been able to manage
the critical aspects of the agency. Thanks to the increasingly unified alignment of the RTD
team, there is now opportunity to not only continue managing RTD's transit operations but
also to explore new opportunities, such as: 1) Identifying and/or creating new sustainable
revenue streams; 2) Strengthening public outreach; and 3) Exploring industry-leading
innovation to address a challenging service area in exciting but practical/achievable ways.

59

GM Johnson is a skilled and experienced transit leader with a keen and clear understanding
of federal, state, and local policies that impact transit operations. GM Johnson is killed in
navigating complex budgets and identifying cost savings opportunities to benefit and
provide value to our customer and our workforce. GM has proven her commitment to
embed diversity and equity efforts into the fabric of our agency and maintained that
commitment with courage and tenacity. GM Johnson highly communicative, people focused,
people centered and consistent in her efforts to ensure that our efforts center our most

Debra has had a lot to do to bring a frazzled team back together. She has been a
consistent example of what leadership can and will be. Her effectiveness internally will
help her build a better agency at all levels.

45

I can see a clear difference in the staff and how they feel energized with the leadership of
CEO Johnson. She had done amazing work in this area.

Sometimes, working within an established organization to make it more efficient and
effective, means change and that is uncomfortable for entrenched employees. Debra
has managed this forthrightly and honestly to better establish her team

The GM has not properly addressed the viability of the SLT.

51

I believe the GM/CEO is very strong in these areas. Some of this is difficult for me to
judge.

52

This is a bit challenging to gauge - but actions we do know of (such as meeting and
developing relationships with CCDC) has yielded clear benefits for riders and the agency.
Looking forward to greater creativity and 'out of the box' thinking in other areas.

56

Despite her enormously hectic schedule, Debra has always been prompt in her replies to
my inquiries. I really appreciate that attribute.

57

Ms. Johnson achieved strong RTD-wide internal alignment in less than one year and has
earned the respect of her team. This is allowing her to rapidly deploy staff to accomplish
critical tasks.

59

GM has proven her commitment to our employees, with a deep understanding and
commitment to employee ownership. GM Johnson prioritized professional development,
employee engagement, and compensation with our budget to covey not only in words
but in action employee value. GM Johnson has transformed the culture, in a short few
months, within the agency and demonstrated her commitment to being on the frontlines
with employees when tough decisions need to be made. GM works in partnership with

ensure her decision-making is informed by not only the theoretical but the practical.

44

Debra has brought her strength and integrity to the regional community and that is
known and appreciated internally and externally. She was hired with the hope that she
would do just that.

45

I have to say, seeing firsthand how CEO Johnson has worked with the Governor has been
beyond impressive. It is no secret that the Governor has hostile feelings about RTD that
have been an issue for him for years. I do believe that for the first time he has seen a
strong, vibrant leader in Ms. Johnson's leadership abilities that has made him take pause.
Is it perfect? not yet but he is backing off and realizing that he is dealing with a very
talented industry leader.

49

Much of GM/CEO Johnson's outreach efforts have been focused on the "squeaky wheel"
NW and Denver communities. She has done an excellent job. That said, looking forward,
I would encourage her to reach out to the "silent majority" of District taxpayers in some
of the other districts.

51

Debra has engaged in many meetings with different constituents and is creating some
important relationships. Going out to the communities, meeting with the Accountability
Committee and others are important steps. We need to implement the ideas from the
Accountability Committee, at least with respect to local service councils and pilot
programs. External relations are critical to RTD's future. This should be a focus going
forward. Debra needs to be developing these relationships herself, but to rebuild trust in
RTD, she also needs to recognize and utilize the existing relationships that so many
people on the board have. The Governor's budget that includes $28 million for some
period in ozone non-attainment season is a first step in the state giving more money to
support public transit and RTD in particular. GM/CEO needs to work together on this
plan and cultivate these relationships. RTD's future sustainability either lies in expanding
the funding pie or in shrinking the agency. The board should be involved in this decision,
and the GM/CEO should be working to develop the option of growing the pie. Relations
with the Governor and his cabinet and staff should be front and center.

52

We saw such a positive start with Auraria and DPS. Current work with Adco is
constructive but it took a showdown to get there. My hope is we'd work proactively, and
be more open to working with area stakeholders, when concerns are first raised.
Likewise, the big break with the State, not it seems RTD's or the CEO's doing, but heading
it off would have been better, even if it meant yielding, looking for compromise, on the
particular interests. On the Accountability Committee, it's yet an open question as to
whether we'll carry through - the lack of reference and particulars since causes concern it
will be mainly not. Finally -- really appreciated the evident engagement with Longmont
reported on from a recent visit. That sort of engagement and gained understanding does
much to build relationships and can bring about real responsiveness. Would encourage
the CEO to get out on her own to the broad reaches of the District she has yet to be able
to visit.

56

Debra has quickly become the face and voice of RTD. That has not always been the case
with former CEOs. I relish her willingness to meet regularly with all stakeholder groups.
Her input to the Accountability Committee was on-point and clearly valuable. I also
appreciate her regular attendance at NATA and many other critical organizations.

57

Ms. Johnson has stepped into a very challenging political environment. Early in her
tenure, she faced criticism and pressure from many political leaders, including the

23

Packet Pg. 30

Attachment: 2021 RTD GM.CEO Evaluation Responses (4598 : Approval of General Manager and CEO's 2021 Performance Appraisal and 2022 Adjusted

4.A.b

Governor. She also came into an environment where an Accountability Committee was
already at work evaluating the effectiveness of RTD in parallel to her own efforts to do
so. The pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic amplified these challenges and heightened
emotions. While most of the pressures Ms. Johnson has faced have not resulted from
her own actions, she has accepted full accountability of any problems RTD is involved in.
She also communicates facts and not excuses. This has allowed her to gain considerable
credibility with external parties. Ms. Johnson is putting forward a strong effort to build
strong relationships while still maintaining personal conviction, honesty, and integrity.
Ms. Johnson has attended countless events in the community and worked in earnest to
be a truthful communicator. Again, this has earned her respect in the community and a
high level of credibility. However, External Relations has room for improvement. RTD
faces risks and challenges caused by a perception of mistrust that continues to persist.
Various stakeholders (beyond simply elected officials) still believe RTD is an "agency of
no" and still perceive RTD as an agency that wants to tell rather than listen. While some
of this is perception, separating perception from reality and then tackling both will be
important in 2022 and beyond. The credibility and respect Ms. Johnson has earned can
be mobilized to continue to improve external relationships. Furthermore, Ms. Johnson
can now use the internal team she has so expertly aligned in 2021 to improve these
external relationships by setting clear goals, outcomes, and expectations.
59

GM Johnson inherited an agency without a communicated vision nor clear direction,
actions by previously leadership were reactionary and/or tactical; rarely strategic,
resulting in deep dissatisfaction of RTD with our external partners, including our
customers. GM Johnson has begun to steer the agency is a direction in which RTD is seen
as a partner agency and not an agency of "no". GM Johnson has developed partnerships
that have yielded COVID testing and COVID vaccines for our customers and our
workforce in partnership with local and state agencies. GM Johnson managed
expectations with the Accountability Committee will also providing space for valuable
and necessary dialogue to provide the space for learning and to better inform
recommendations. GM Johnson has worked to ensure proactive communication
regarding the A-Line Quiet Zones for the residence along the corridor, as few examples of
her leadership.

44

Debra is good at what she does - that's why she was hired. She was handed a big job and she
is doing it as well as she said she would. She has really shown in her first year that she is
adept, competent, and self-assured.

45

CEO Johnson came to an agency that desperately needed leadership and she delivered! The
5-year strategic plan was exactly what we needed to move this agency forward in a clear,
inclusive and transparent manner.

49

great interaction with board members, both individually and collectively. I would encourage
more probing of issues across the region (not just Denver and NW) moving forward

50

The GM has a concept of policy/operations that is not in alignment with many board
members. Board members are often left out of critical discussions prior to being required to
vote on an issue.

51

I believe Debra Johnson is a strong CEO and can be a great CEO. I think the biggest weakness
right now is in working with the board. The board has been patient and supportive because,
I believe, board members do feel that we have gained a very experienced and capable CEO
and want to support her. But policy decisions should lie with the board, and the board's
authority is being steadily eroded. I believe some frank discussions would be helpful about
what issues are policy issues, what policies the board should be discussing and how we work
with the GM/CEO. The final section here says that the "GM/CEO engaged, collaborated, and
partnered with Board members to advocate on behalf of RTD with elected officials at local,
state, and national levels to ensure that RTD continues to demonstrate its commitment to
quality service, increased mobility, regional economic growth, and sustainable
development." The GM/CEO's response is about how she advocates, rather than how she
engages and partners with board members to advocate on behalf of RTD. Many of the local
and state groups and people do not trust RTD, but they do trust individual board members,
many of whom they have worked with for many years. We need to work together to
leverage those existing relationships of board members to help return trust in RTD and
develop trust in Debra.

52

RTD differs from many agencies, I believe, in that the enabling Act does not prescribe the
duties and powers of the CEO, only those of the board. Sen. Scott's editorial this week (about
his bill that would change CDOT's commission to an elected body) supports the premise that
an elected board is one with more heft, does more than act as an approval body. Voters,
meanwhile, reasonably expect their representatives to be able, collectively, to work with the
CEO to change the agency's priorities and direction when needed. The board can and ought
to be the CEO's best asset in a complex and highly variable District, and our particular CEO,
with her many strengths, could be a real powerhouse, viewed as responsive and effective. A
meaningful partnership with the elected board would make that more likely.

56

Outstanding performance in this area. Debra provides timely feedback to my inquiries which
is very helpful. I appreciate the growing cohesiveness regarding consistent Board
communication. She represents us very professionally in a myriad of situations. She has our
backs!

57

Ms. Johnson is a highly responsive employee. She is thorough in her communication with
the Board, rapidly responds to Board requests, and swiftly communicates important matters
to the Board. Ms. Johnson has provided the Board with real-time situational awareness
during crises and critical situations. This is always important in a transit agency but is
arguably even more important during a global pandemic. Ms. Johnson has demonstrated an

28

Packet Pg. 35

ability to prioritize the content and frequency of her communications. In this way, she is a
highly professional and focused communicator. Ms. Johnson has gone beyond the
responsibilities of her job description to assist the Board of Directors with Board matters,
which will greatly benefit the agency in the long run. These efforts have included her
collaboration on the development of new committees, on the evaluation and improvement
of the Internal Audit Function, and more. This has demonstrated her ability to partner with
the Board in a thoughtful, deliberate, and collaborative manner. This work is not only
appreciated, but it is important to improving RTD as a whole. The Strategic Planning process
in 2021 was an important step in the direction of maturing and strengthening RTD. From the
process, it is clear that Ms. Johnson intends to take full ownership and accountability of the
activities and outcomes of the entire agency. It is also clear that Ms. Johnson intends to be
focused and to seek focus from her team. This accountability and this focus are excellent
and will serve the agency well. In 2022, it is now imperative that the Board of Directors and
Ms. Johnson partner to tightly align around the handoff between policy and operations. The
Board has the opportunity to fully own policy matters and then provide advice to Ms.
Johnson on operational matters. Ms. Johnson has the opportunity to fully own operational
matters and then provide advice to the Board on policy matters. Clearly aligning around this
in 2022 is a significant opportunity that will benefit from the strategic framework now in
place. It is clear that there were some concerns about the 2021 Strategic Planning process
from members of the Board. These concerns can be addressed in 2022 as the agency
establishes baseline metrics and a new sense of focus that were both absent prior to Ms.
Johnson's leadership of RTD. Ms. Johnson may have an opportunity to collaborate even
more closely with her Board members to advocate on behalf of RTD. She has already been
leveraging these relationships, which has been a good partnership. Expanding this
partnership may be part of improving External Relationships. Ms. Johnson demonstrates
such a high level of leadership that she is an ideal CEO for a Board of Directors. She owns
operations, enables & empowers her team, has high but fair expectations, and is able to
communicate her goals clearly and often.
59

GM Johnson has made herself available to the Board members. She regularly checks in with
board members and serves as a thought partner and creator for policy considerations
members may be working on. She is responsive to director request, transparent in her
leadership and over communicates. She led the board, in partnership with consultants,
through several strategic planning sessions resulting in a clearly articulated, defined, and
measurable vision to move the agency forward.

Debra has done a good job - maybe even a great job - but that is what she was hired to
do. I'm glad that she feels good about her work at RTD but do not feel that she has done
more than her job (exceeded expectations) in all categories.

45

She is a force to be reckoned with! Wherever we go, I continually hear how impressed
folks are with her knowledge and ability to make folks feel welcomed.

49

If I could give a higher rating, I would. Debra brings all of those attributes and more,
including "guts". Her willingness to "walk" in the meeting with the Governor garnered my
upmost respect

50

The GM is a consummate professional. She is not rattled by conflict and keeps her cool in
tense situations.

52

Informal settings, working with others in a call, say, or meeting one-on-one, is where you
see one of the CEO's secret weapons, in my view. She’s quick to respond, and is highly
engaging and persuasive.

56

She is one of the more dynamic leaders that I have ever worked with. She is our
champion. I find her innovative, compassionate, creative, diligent, and driven. I am
actually excited about RTD's future with Debra at the helm (behind the wheel)!

57

Ms. Johnson is an A performer. Truly A. The excitement and alignment of her team says
it all: she is both a natural and practiced professional leader. The team at RTD is able to
share and challenge ideas freely while still remaining tightly aligned. Achieving this kind
of environment takes an empathetic, motivated, creative, energetic, demanding, and fair
leader. This is the type of leader Ms. Johnson is. While I could not say enough positive
things about Ms. Johnson as an individual and how she conducts herself and her work,
given that she is a leader, I need only point to her team to demonstrate her success in this
area.

59

GM Johnson is a thoughtful, insightful, courageous, and honest leader. She is a strategic
thinker, a compassionate leader, and is always centering the people in her leadership. She
is committed to serving the needs of our most marginalized citizens while balancing the
needs of our stakeholders throughout the district. She models bold and courageous
leadership and is constantly receiving private praise by her workforce for brining such a
presence of love into leadership and unapologetically bringing her entire self to work
every day and encouraging her staff to do the same. She is a beacon of hope and light
during such a tumultuous time. She consistently reminds us that "public transit is the
great societal equalizer" and is always leading through that lens.

understanding of the transit industry 3-Responsiveness and thoroughness (e.g., your GM
reports to the Board are excellent)

50

Professionalism, dedication, steadfastness.

52

Credibility in the transit sphere; personally engaging (disarming!) in informal settings; and
sheer professional capability.

54

She makes a great effort to meet transport>Stion "players" and elected officials

55

1. Debra Johnson has a deep knowledge of transit operations and the transit industry that
gives her the ability to consider different approaches to issues that arise based on
experience with several different agencies. 2. Very personable, likable personality and a
willingness to engage in a wide variety of one-on-one meetings, in which she is very
effective. 3. She has a strong and important focus on equity and diversity.

56

She is sincerely passionate about her role at RTD. She is thorough, not reckless in her
approach. She is an outstanding communicator.

57

1) Leadership. Ms. Johnson has aligned a large team in a short period of time during a
challenging global crisis. 2) Focus. Ms. Johnson stays focused on her mission. 3) Integrity.
Ms. Johnson is honest and truthful in all situations.

59

GM Johnson is a strategic thinking, planner, and executer. GM Johnson is people centered
and people focused, with a focus on social and economic mobility. GM Johnson understands

What are the three areas in which the General Manager/CEO might develop their
skills to bring greater value to the agency?
RESPONSEID

RESPONSE

37

Describe things in simpler, layman's terms

43

Respecting Colorado experience and norms Providing clear and succinct explanations to
stakeholders Remaining open to "outside the box" solutions

44

Debra needs to develop a better understanding of an elected Board and how those people
work in the community, while collaborating more with the Board to address their feedback
from that viewpoint. She needs to look very hard at the public perception of the agency at
the "man on the street" level. She needs to capitalize on the increasing awareness of our
climate issues and be at the forefront of every conversation yelling "transit!! RTD!!!'.

45

Our communications department needs to have some real innovation. Keeping the board
updated with difficult situations: DUS.

47

I believe our GM/CEO is an individual who constantly reflects and seems to improve her
skillet and trust in that process

48

An increase in partnerships to advance projects and/or pilot programs would be excellent,
but I believe this goal is already one that has been discussed for GM/CEO Johnson and the
agency as a whole.

49

1-Expand reach to outlying districts-probe to learn and understand their pain points 2-slow
down. Sometimes it is difficult for others to keep pace with the rapid pace of your speech
(and vocabulary) cadence 3-

50

Board interactions, being open about the tension between policy and operations with an
elected board of directors, critically evaluate the SLT.

52

Regional engagement (use the board!); public governance; cultivating flexibility within and
by the agency

54

Better follow up on requests for information from Board Members. Needs to consult with
Board before establishing new Board policy

55

1. Working together and fostering discussion with elected official members of the board to
achieve the best policies for RTD. 2. Lead the agency in visioning and scenario planning to
achieve an organization that provides the most service that we are able to, given our
financial and workforce constraints, and that leads in addressing regional issues. 3.
Willingness to make extra efforts and compromise in relations with the Governor, CDOT and
others

56

Only one thing I can think of: Sometimes she could slow her delivery down a bit. She has so
much knowledge, wisdom, and innovation to share that there are occasions where I struggle
to absorb it all, so I fear I miss some of her messages.

57

1) Ambassadorship. While already more than an adept communicator (communicating
frequently, clearly, honestly), there are opportunities to bring external people/parties
together and into the fold of the RTD mission. This will not be easy given the challenging
environment, but if anyone can get external parties aligned around (and feeling of shared
ownership of) the RTD mission, it's Ms. Debra Johnson. 2) Strategy-Focus. Ms. Johnson has

34

good strategy experience and capabilities; however, given that we are collectively in a global
pandemic and given that she stepped into a challenging situation at RTD with many historic
issues, she has naturally been unable to focus on long-term strategy, scenario planning, and
long-term innovation. As more of her time frees up hopefully resulting from leadership
team realignment, resolution of immediate problems, and more clarity of the long-term
impact of the pandemic, it'd be great to see her spend ample time on long-term strategy. 3)
Relaxation. Somewhat tongue-in-check with some seriousness mixed in... Ms. Johnson is an
exceptional leader that we cannot afford to have burn out on us. I hope she is finding time
to relax.
59

Are there any questions that you would invite the General Manager/CEO to reflect
on in the coming year?
RESPONSEID

RESPONSE

37

What is the vision for 20 to 30 years down the road considering electric autonomous
shuttles? How do we finance and operate with these types of new vehicles?

44

I would like the GM/CEO to ask herself "what is wrong with the public image of RTD" and
then "what can be done about that?". She's doing a great job of bringing the agency back
"on track" and her peers locally recognize that, but she has not done such a great job
conveying that to the general public. That is not solely her fault, but the issue comes back to
her.

45

What do you think the role should be between the union and the board? I know there are
some board members who would like for there to be more interaction.

47

How can we better clarify the Board's role in supporting and furthering the goals of the
agency and strategic plan?

48

As we recover from the pandemic, how is RTD adapting to forward-thinking ideas and how
are we keeping the public informed to these potential accomplishments?

49

no. I have included them in previous comments

50

None that she already does not know about.

52

Reflect on and share as I'm curious: Is Colorado and the Denver metro area different from
what she's seen in regard to public policy, politics and government?

54

Board members have no opportunities or plans in place to re-start in-person meetings as
soon as possible. Board members have no opportunities to discuss issues informally.

55

1. How can I foster policy-level discussions and seek meaningful input with and from the
board? 2. What decisions and vision do we need to foster to become an effective leader in
the GHG and air pollution discussions in the region? 3. Are we approaching our marketing
and communications the most effective way?

56

Only one: Are you taking care of yourself?

57

How can RTD truly innovate in the post-pandemic world? What can we do to address this
large, sprawling service area and how can we strengthen our system through agility?

59

What is one thing you have built foundationally this year that will carry you into the coming
years? What might a restructure of the CAC provide in terms of usefulness and
effectiveness.

What additional behaviors might the General Manager/CEO introduce that would
enhance their effectiveness?
RESPONSEID

RESPONSE

37

Speak more at public events like Chamber of Commerce annual lunch, etc.

44

I think that Debra will develop and enhance her own effectiveness as she settles into her
job and her community here in Denver. She has done a phenomenal job in her first year,
given all of the issues that she had to start with.

45

CEO Johnson is an astounding leader. She has been here for one year and has done more
than any other CEO. Her level of energy and creativity is so impressive. I can hardly wait
to see what is next.

47

Increase effectiveness within the Board Office to allow for increased effectiveness of the
agency and communication to preserve her time to focus on matters of high importance
to the agency

48

None at this time.

49

I have included most of them in previous comments. Advice: You have enjoyed a great
relationship with the Board Chair this past year. Next year will be different. Please reach
out to other directors for perspective and support

52

Less formality, when possible, in written communication and in larger meetings or
settings.

56

Keep creativity/innovation at the forefront with senior staff members so we can shed the
image of "the Agency of no".

57

In 2022, Ms. Johnson and the Board of Directors have a collective, shared opportunity to
increase their partnership. This is less of an individual behavior and more of something
for us all to be collectively mindful of.

How might the General Manager/CEO adjust their approach to bring more value to
the community, customers, and workforce?
RESPONSEID

RESPONSE

37

1. Greater focus on new electric buses & creating mobility hubs 2. Beautification of stops
and stations with trees and public art 3. Allow our contract lobbyists at all 3 levels of
government to present to the Board

43

Internally, the GM/CEO has implemented systemic changes that will serve the agency in
the future. From a community perspective, though, RTD's approach seems unchanged
from the agency-of-no days.

44

Debra has had the inherently right approach to most of the issues involving community
and workforce. She might put more of her team working toward customers - as that
includes everyone in the MPO, not just existing riders. As we all move toward more transit
as part of climate solutions, RTD needs to engage more than our existing ridership base.

45

I know her plan is to become more grassroots with customers. We need that. We need to
look at communication tools that are not working and trying new ways of connections.

47

See previous answer re reflection

48

GM/CEO Johnson should continue to be a communication resource for the community,
customers, and the workforce. The parties listed above should feel that RTD is open to
collaboration and partnership.

49

This past year you have made organizational and leadership changes. As a result, there
may be a bit of confusion from customers and community leaders about RTD contacts and
decision-making. I suggest clarifying protocol for such communication

50

continue outreach, bring board together to see/understand that decisions affecting one
area/district impact and are important to all areas/districts/directors

52

The performance framework has real potential for getting at the factors that are
important to riders and others. But the success of our agency is so tied to health of the
region, it will be important to listen to outside views (about what we do) that are strictly
speaking not in the realm of transit operation and expertise. And be open to folding those
views into our work.

54

Discuss ideas with the Board before implementing.

55

I think she is doing great work with the workforce, a problem that is not quickly solved. By
working more closely with board members who have ties to the various communities and
stakeholders, the GM/CEO can utilize these relationships to enhance RTD's place in the
community.

56

Her availability has been extremely helpful with many of our constituents, from leaders to
riders. I ask that this practice continues as we strive to build trust and partnerships with
our cities and counties.

57

Not an adjustment ... a continuation and emphasis: continue to drive focus and
continually communicate the importance of that focus. Wherever possible, bring external
parties into the fold in a way that gives them shared ownership of the RTD mission and
the focus that enables it (see the comments on Ambassadorship in Question 3 in this

section). This isn't about pleasing stakeholders: if everyone can truly believe RTD exists to
make lives better through connections, they can help us achieve this mission for the
ultimate benefit of our customers.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
December 7, 2021

Approval of Amended Board Bylaws

Board Meeting Date:
December 7, 2021
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached amendments to the Board Bylaws.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Shelley Cook, Director District L
Doug Tisdale, Director District H
Melanie Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board Bylaws govern the internal affairs of the Board of Directors pursuant to the authority granted
to the Board in §§32-9-101 to -163, C.R.S. The Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure, led by
Directors Cook and Tisdale, was formed in 2020 by Chair Rivera-Malpiede to analyze the advisability of
altering the composition of the Board’s standing committees. On October 26, 2021, the Board adopted
the Ad Hoc Committee’s recommendations for revisions to the Board’s committee structure in order to
optimize the number of members assigned to each committee; encourage full and fruitful debate by
decentralizing decision-making; leverage members’ relevant experience; and promote meeting
efficiencies.
DISCUSSION
The proposed amendments to the Bylaws have been reviewed by General Counsel and are an effort to:
• Memorialize the new standing committee structure and committee responsibilities;
• Establish new procedures for the selection of committee members and committee leadership;
• Establish a new regular meeting schedule; and
• Provide for germane public comment at all standing committee meetings
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the amended Board Bylaws.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Board Committee Structure

Committee Meeting Date:
October 19, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt revisions to its committee structure in order to optimize the number
of members assigned to each committee; encourage full and fruitful debate by decentralizing decisionmaking; leverage members’ relevant experience; and promote meeting efficiencies; in accordance with
the following discussion.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure (ad hoc committee) was formed in 2020 by Chair
Rivera-Malpiede to analyze the advisability of altering the composition of the Board’s standing
committees to optimize the number of members assigned to each committee; encourage full and fruitful
debate by decentralizing decision-making; leverage members’ relevant experience; and promote meeting
efficiencies. Directors Cook and Tisdale led the ad hoc committee’s work.
During August 2021, a working group convened by the General Manager and CEO, composed of
Directors Cook and Tisdale, General Manager and CEO, and staff, designed a process to implement the
ad hoc committee’s work into a recommendation for the Board’s consideration of a new committee
structure. The working group, based on previous feedback received from Directors, aligned on the
concept of establishing four standing committees, along with a separate Audit Committee. It is proposed
that each standing committee would be composed of between five and seven members and that the
Audit Committee composition would be prescribed by the International Professional Practices Framework
(IPPF) and confirmed by a third-party subject matter expert.
During the Operations and Customer Service Committee on Tuesday, September 14, 2021, the Board
suggested revisions to questions contained in a draft survey instrument created to assess the Board’s
alignment regarding specific aspects of the committee restructure. Responses garnered from the survey
informed changes to the proposed committee structure.
If adopted, proposed changes to the committee structure would necessitate corresponding Board Bylaws
revisions, which the Board would consider in November 2021 in order for the structural changes to take
place beginning January 1, 2022.
DISCUSSION
The proposed changes to the committee structure are as follows:

Attachment: 2021-10-26 Board Committee Restructure Board Report (4599 : Approval of Amended Board Bylaws)

Board Meeting Date:
October 26, 2021

Packet Pg. 167

1) Committee Composition. Beginning January 1, 2022, standing committees will no longer be
committees of the whole. Standing committees will be composed of between five and seven
members as determined by the Executive Committee.
2) Standing Committees. The four standing committees will be as follows:
a. Finance and Planning Committee – Responsible for agency financial matters, including but
not limited to budget and monthly financial statement review, determination of the fiscal
impact of all Board actions, and long-range planning and capital projects
b. Operations and Safety Committee – Responsible for operational matters, including all
contracted and non-contracted bus, rail, paratransit, and microtransit services, as well as
safety and security matters
c. Performance Committee – Responsible for performance management of the General
Manager and CEO and the GM/CEO’s contract and annual comprehensive performance
evaluation, as well monitoring metrics as to the agency’s performance related to the
Strategic Plan success outcomes
d. Executive Committee – Responsible for agenda review for each regular meeting of the
Board and addressing ministerial matters affecting the Board, public affairs, external
relations, and legislation
3) Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will consist of five officers, including the Chair,
First Vice Chair, Second Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer. The process for nomination and
selection of members will mirror recent practices, and officers will serve for a term of one year.
4) Committee Membership. Based upon Directors’ stated interest in serving on standing committees,
the Executive Committee will select the membership for each committee, and the Board will ratify
the selections.
5) Committee Chairs. The Chairs and Vice-Chairs will be selected by the members of the committee.
The term of each committee chair and vice chair will be one year.
6) Quorum. For standing committees of five members, a quorum necessary to conduct business will
be reached with three Directors present and participating, whether in person or attending
virtually. For committees of six or seven members, a quorum will be reached with four Directors
present and participating.
7) Audit Committee. A separate, independent Audit Committee will also be created. The
committee’s composition, structure, operation, processes, and procedures, including the quorum
necessary for the committee to conduct business, will align with the International Professional
Practices Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors as suggested by the contracted
independent audit consultant and separately ratified by the Board.
8) Meeting Schedule. Meetings will be scheduled as follows:
a. The Finance and Planning Committee and the Operations and Safety committee will
typically be scheduled for the second Tuesday and the following Wednesday of each
month, after 5:30 p.m., except as stated in paragraph c.
b. The Board Meeting will typically be scheduled for the fourth Tuesday of every month,
except as stated in paragraph c. When no recommended actions must be addressed during
a Board Meeting in a given month, the Board reserves the option to cancel the meeting.
c. Unless the agency’s business needs require otherwise, no standing committee meetings or
monthly Board Meetings will be scheduled in August or December of each year.
d. Executive Committee meetings will be typically scheduled for noon on the third Thursday
of each month.
e. Performance Committee and Audit Committee meetings will be scheduled as necessary to
fulfill the committees’ responsibilities.
9) Public Comment. Public commentary germane to the topics listed in the published meeting
agenda for the current and immediately preceding month will be taken at the beginning of each
committee meeting. The Board Office will establish a process to allow individuals to submit
