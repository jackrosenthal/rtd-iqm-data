BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis and Zero Fare for Youth
Program Continuation

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to concurrently adopt the continuance of the Zero Fare for Youth
(ZFY) program and the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the ZFY proposed fare change to comply
with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Carl Green Jr, Director, Civil Rights Division
Monika Treipl-Harnke, Senior Manager, Revenue
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B. In this circular, the FTA requires transit
agencies, such as RTD, to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those
changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The
continuance of the ZFY program meets the definition of a fare change. Thus, an analysis is required to
be brought before the Board for approval. The complete final Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report is
included in Attachment A.
During the June 11, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the 12-month pilot program from September 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, with the
intention of continuing the ZFY program for the following school year. The discussion item included
information about increased youth boardings, estimated forgone youth revenue, and the potential for
grant funding through Senate Bill 24-032 (SB032).
DISCUSSION
In adopting the continuance of the ZFY program, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff have now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare change
and final Title VI fare equity analysis. Consequently, the proposed fare change is ready for the Board’s
consideration. The following discussion is divided into six sections outlining the following:

1. Final Title VI fare equity analysis findings
2. Community outreach activities
3. Feedback on Staff’s recommendation
4. Final recommendation summary
5. Projected youth ridership and forgone fare revenue
6. Implementation
1. Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies, and notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population. As
a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare
per boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their
average fare with the proposed change. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the
establishment of a longer-term ZFY program following the conclusion of the pilot.
2. Community Outreach Activities
Public outreach events regarding the continuation of the ZFY program were held in conjunction with
public meetings regarding the upcoming September 2024 service changes. RTD hosted five in-person
open houses and one virtual public meeting between June 18-26, 2024, to communicate the proposed
changes, answer questions, and collect feedback from customers, stakeholders, and the community. In
addition to these public meetings, staff were available to answer questions about the proposed
extension of the ZFY program during its participation at community events. The public outreach
activities comport with the Federal Transit Administration’s Title VI Requirements and Guidelines and are
illustrated in Section 7 of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
3. Feedback on Staff’s Recommendation
Through the outreach process, significant support was provided for the continuance of the ZFY program.
The following themes regarding the program were present in the feedback:
•
•
•
•
•

Supports youth in accessing school and work
Benefits families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who
see driving as a more affordable option
Meets climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provides youth with independence and agency
Encourages lifelong transit use

4. Final Recommendation Summary
The Board’s adoption of the proposed fare structure would continue the no-cost fare for youth through
August 31, 2025. For comparison purposes, the tables following provide a summary of the existing pilot
fare structure alongside the fare structure for customers, ages 19 and under, without ZFY.

Fare Structure without ZFY

Incorporated into staff’s recommendation, youth customers would be able to travel to any destination,
including Denver International Airport, at no cost.
5. Projected Youth Ridership and Forgone Fare Revenue
With a ZFY program, youth boardings in 2025 are estimated to be 13.9 million. Estimated youth
ridership for the subsequent years, should a ZFY program continue beyond 2025, is shown in the table
below.

Packet Pg. 5

1.E.1

The forgone fare revenue in 2025 due to a ZFY program is estimated to be $2.9 million. Estimated
forgone fare revenue for the subsequent years is shown in the following table.

*RTD fares decreased on January 1, 2024
SB032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up
to $5 million to RTD in FY2024-25, provided that the agency applies for the grant. Should RTD apply
and be approved for this grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in
ridership, provide operating support for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for
other expenses necessary to implement and measure the effectiveness of the program. This includes but
is not limited to reasonable marketing expenses and expenses incurred conducting customer surveys.
In addition to the forgone youth revenue estimated above, additional funds will be necessary to continue
the ZFY program for marketing awareness and informational reminders across RTD’s transit network,
language assistance and effective communications, a survey for youth customers or their guardians, and
an annual report. RTD estimates these costs to total approximately $410,000 from September 1, 2024
– August 31, 2025. Therefore, the $5 million in available grant funding is expected to offset forgone
revenue as well as additional expenses continuation of a ZFY program from September 1, 2024 through
August 31, 2025.
6. Implementation
In order to be eligible for state grant funding, RTD will need to apply to the Colorado Energy Office.
Details on the grant program are not yet available, but RTD is working closely with the Colorado Energy
Office to understand the grant terms and process for receiving funding.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As noted in the Discussion section of this report, the recommendation would result in forgone fare
revenue of approximately $2,900,000 as well as estimated costs of $410,000, for a total financial
impact of $3,310,000. The financial impact would be fully offset by the grant established by SB032,
should RTD apply for and be awarded the grant. The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will
not result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

May 3, 20241.E.1.a

1 Introduction
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
On June 2, 2023, RTD formally requested authorization to proceed with a 12-month Zero Fare for Youth pilot, as
well as a time extension for completing a fare equity analysis of a potential permanent Zero Fare for Youth change
since the pilot extends beyond the normal six-month period allowed under Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
rules. The FTA approved RTD's Title VI Fare Equity Analysis extension request on June 22, 2023, in order to ensure
all critical tasks associated with the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program were completed. This analysis of the Zero
Fare for Youth program was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV and Appendix K of
FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare change
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare change.

2 Overview of Proposed Fare Change
On July 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new fare structure, policies and programs that included
the one year of no-cost transit for youth throughout the district. The fare changes 1 were developed as part of
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, a yearlong review aimed at creating a fare structure
that is more equitable, affordable and simple. Most of the fare changes were implemented in early 2024.
The Zero Fare for Youth pilot program was made available for youth customers September 2023 through August
2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, are eligible for participation in
the pilot. RTD is funding the financial impact resulting from implementation of a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program
for the first year. For long-term sustainability, RTD sought out funding partners to support the continuation of the
program after the pilot. RTD will be positioned to adopt this zero-fare offering if funding is secured.
In January 2024, Colorado lawmakers introduced Senate Bill (SB) 24-032 Methods to Increase the Use of Transit.
SB-032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up to $5 million

to RTD in FY2024-25, provided that the agency applies for the grant. Should RTD apply and be approved for this
grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in ridership, provide operating support
for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for other expenses necessary to implement and
measure the effectiveness of the program.
On May 14, 2024, staff presented a discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee regarding the draft
results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the FTA
Circular 4702.1B. The continuance of the ZFY program meets the definition of a fare change. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for consideration and approval.
On June 11, 2024, staff presented a discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee regarding the results
of the 12-month pilot program from September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024 with the intention of continuing
the ZFY program for the following school year. The discussion item included information about increased youth
boardings, estimated forgone youth revenue, and the potential for grant funding through SB 24-032.
Staff have now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare change and final
Title VI fare equity analysis. Thereby, the proposed fare change to continue the ZFY program will be brought
forward on July 23, 2024 for the Board’s consideration and approval.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 2 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

1.E.1.a
July 2, 2024

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.
RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).

July 2, 2024

Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

4 Fare Equity Analysis Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected. 3 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 4
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority

or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Throughout the document, the following definitions are used:
●
●

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

4.1 Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction
Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the 2019 CSS sample size was smaller than
the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption, which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes. The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any ridership
changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure of rider sensitivity to changes in fare
rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions are essential to modeling anticipated
ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but are often excluded from fare equity analyses.
Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a segment of customers prior to a fare
change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in average fare. This calculation becomes
unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract new customers to the system or from
other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to compare the average fare impacts of the fare
changes on the same segment of customers after the change in pricing and policies.

July 2, 2024

4.1.1 Demographic Data
For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys. RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger
sample of completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic
fare adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched
– MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers.

4.1.2 Demographic Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.
Low response rates for some rider categories, fare levels and fare payment types, as well as the absence of some
fare payment options on the survey pose several challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address the
limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.
The following demographic assumptions are used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, because 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

4.1.3 Additional Average Fare Analysis Assumptions
Assumptions were made regarding the impact of the Zero Fare for Youth program on the EcoPass programs;
namely, the Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass program customers. The EcoPass programs are universal pass
programs, where all (or the vast majority) of a business, neighborhood or college are required to participate. By
having a large group of participants with varying levels of utilization of the system under a single contract, RTD
can continue to charge the contracted entity only for those trips that are taken. But when that cost is spread
across a large group of customers, it results in a relatively affordable rate per customer. In all three cases, the
utilization of the system multiplied by a fare rate is the fundamental determinant of contract pricing, although the
specific calculation steps differ slightly for each Pass Program.
With the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth policy, the utilization of younger customers eligible for the Zero
Fare for Youth program is expected to be excluded from the Pass Program pricing calculation, thereby resulting in
a lower contract amount. For a number of the Neighborhood EcoPass contracts and nearly all CollegePass
contracts, this is expected to result in a notable decrease in future contract pricing. For business EcoPass, some
small contract pricing impacts may be felt however past survey data has suggested that the share of participating
employees that are 19 years of age or younger is a relatively small share.
However, the benefits of the lower contract pricing cannot be easily attributed to any given individual because
pass program participants do not pay on a per-boarding basis, and may not pay for their EcoPass at all. For
example, with the CollegePass program, if 30% of a college community was eligible for the Zero Fare for Youth
program, any assessment of equity impacts would need to know whether the College planned to reduce the per
student CollegePass fee by 30% for all participating students (regardless of age) or planned to allow students 19
years of age and under to opt out of the fee, with the remaining students covering the remainder of the contract
amount (which may increase their CollegePass price). Depending on the decision, these can have markedly
different financial outcomes on individual participants, and these decisions fall to the participating colleges, not
to RTD. In the case of business EcoPass, a number of employers fully subsidize the cost of EcoPass and employees
do not pay anything for their use of the transit system; in these cases, any change in EcoPass pricing related to the
introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program would not have any impact on the per-boarding cost to
employees, it would only impact the overall cost to the employer. Further, with little detail on specific
demographics by contract and by age group, assessing per customer demographic impacts is not possible.

For this reason, the average fare analysis assumes that there are no changes in the average fare for the business
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass programs. It is likely that at least some participants in these
programs will benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program over
time however, given that participants in these programs do not pay on a per-boarding basis, that the distribution
of benefits can vary widely across Pass Program participants, and that the demographic makeup of individual Pass
Program contracts is not known, the analysis cannot fairly assess potential changes in the average fare.

5 System Ridership Demographics Overview
The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

African-American/Black
Asian/Pacific Islander
Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin
Hispanic/Latino
Native American/Indian
Other (please specify)

5.2 Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.
Table 1 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 2 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

5.3 Ridership Demographics
Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.

Figure 2: Ridership Income

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded
to ethnicity- and income-related questions to develop a breakdown of demographics by fare payment type.
Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 3 presents the fare

6 Fare Change Proposal
As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, the public expressed strong support for a zero
fare for youth pilot. Based on this feedback, staff determined it would be beneficial for the pilot to align with the
2023-24 school year. The proposed fare change is summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
RTD launched a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program for a period of up to 12-months beginning September 1, 2023
and lasting through August 31, 2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, are eligible for
participation in the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot
would likely be supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding
partners. A permanent Zero Fare for Youth program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable,
external funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70%
discount on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program is intended as a pilot, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare
Analysis assumes that the fare pricing for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full
fare before and after the pilot. For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 4 in
Section 6.2.

7.2 Zero Fare for Youth Public Outreach Overview
A kickoff media event occurred on August 8, 2023, at the Chestnut Pavilion Denver Union Station with the
following speakers: Debra A. Johnson General Manager and CEO of RTD, Denver Councilwoman Amanda Sawyer,
District 5, Denver Public Schools Board Member Scott Baldermann, District 1, RTD Board Chair Lynn Guissinger,
District O, RTD Board Director Kate Williams, District A.
Staff convened virtual informational meetings with public school districts on August 21, 2023 and August 24, 2023.
These meetings were held with staff representatives from Adams 12, Adams 14, Adams County, Aurora, Boulder
Valley, Brighton, Cherry Creek, Denver, Douglas County, Englewood, Jeffco, Littleton, Mapleton, St. Vrain Valley,
Westminster. The meetings served as an opportunity to provide an overview of the pilot program, seek
administrative support for program evaluation, respond to questions and garner feedback.
RTD implemented a comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy that featured distinctive creative assets to
inform and engage both existing customers and the wider public about the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. The
multi-faceted approach combined digital and social media, a dedicated webpage 5, in-system assets, public
relations efforts, community engagement, partnerships, and paid media, to effectively communicate the benefits
of public transit while encouraging a positive shift in riding habits in the short and long term. To garner direct
feedback from youth and families, RTD administered surveys, virtually and in-person, between October 16, 2023
and March 15, 2024. The survey consisted of questions about youth and/or family travel behaviors and
experiences using RTD services, thoughts on the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program and general information. The
online survey was available in English and Spanish and offered the chance to win a $25 King Soopers gift card for
up to 20 participants. Appendix A provides the full Zero Fare for Youth Survey Analysis Report.
Staff phoned and emailed 105 private schools, 124 youth-serving organizations, 39 recreation centers and 40
libraries to promote the pilot program, distribute English and Spanish toolkits and disseminate surveys to families

7.3 Summary of Public Comments
Significant support was provided for the continuation of the Zero Fare for Youth program. Commentors expressed
overwhelming enthusiasm noting the program would:
●
●
●
●
●

Supports youth in accessing school and work
Benefits families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who see
driving as a more affordable option
Meets climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provides youth with independence and agency
Encourages lifelong transit use

7.4 Changes to Proposal
Overall, public comments demonstrate immense support for the proposed fare change. Additionally, no items of
significant concern were raised in public comments that suggest further review of the recommendation and its
impacts on the community is necessary. As such, no changes were proposed to the ZFY program continuation
recommendation, and the final Title VI fare equity analysis will be presented on July 23, 2024 to the RTD Board of
Directors for review and adoption.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

1.E.1.a
July 2, 2024

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis provides a robust overview of the proposed fare changes. The Average Fare Analysis
analyzes the proposed fare changes described in Section 6, namely the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth
program.
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes are targeted specifically to Youth customers, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all
customers and minority customers and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5%
policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income
customers to a greater degree than all customers. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.

8.1 Average Fare Analysis Results
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, and
notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers benefit to a greater extent than the overall population in the
Average Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by rider
category. The share of Youth customers that are minority and low-income are higher than the other rider
categories. It is important to recognize that a key assumption in the analysis is that Youth customer demographics
align with the demographics of Local, Full Fare customers, as outlined in Section 4.1.2. The methodology of the
2019 CSS specifically avoided targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this customer group is
underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the survey. This leaves open the
possibility that the demographics of Youth customers are different than what was assumed in the analysis, which
would change the results of the Average Fare Analysis. Without any comprehensive survey data on the
demographics of RTD Youth customers, the assumption is used for the Average Fare Analysis.
Appendix B provides the detailed tables that show the average fare for each rider category and fare payment type
under the current and proposed fare structure. A summary overview of the findings resulting from the change,
including the Average Fare per Boarding, Absolute Change and Percentage Change are presented in Table 7 with
the following description:
●

Changes that represent a greater percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., more beneficial
for minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in green.

●

Changes that represent a lesser percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., less beneficial for
minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in yellow.

●

Changes that are outside the Disparate Impact/Disproportionate Burden threshold (+5%) are highlighted
in light / deep red.

8.1.1 Key Findings
The key findings are reflected below:
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.01 per boarding for all customers, $0.92 for minority customers (9% lower than for all customers)
and $0.80 for low-income customers (21% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare per
boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population.

●

No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their average fare with the proposed changes.

●

As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the analysis assumes no change in the average fare paid by participants in
the three EcoPass programs (business EcoPass, neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass). It is likely that
participants in these programs will eventually benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction
of the Zero Fare for Youth program, but given that (1) students in these programs do not pay on a perboarding basis, (2) organizations have some discretion as to how to apply contract pricing reductions, and
(3) with little detail on specific demographics by contract and by age group, the analysis cannot fairly
assess potential changes in the average fare. By assuming no change in the average fare for the Pass
Programs, the analysis is likely conservative and understates the fare reduction benefits of the Zero Fare
for Youth program.

8.1.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 8 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $0.97 to $0.92, a 5.2% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is 1%, indicating that
minority customers are expected to benefit somewhat more than all customers as a result of the proposed fare
changes. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare
changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

customer population. For low-income customers, the average fare decreases from $0.84 to $0.80, a 5.1%
decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage
point difference between the percentage change for low-income customers and all customers is less than 1%,

indicating that low-income customers are expected to benefit more than all customers as a result of the proposed
fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s Disproportionate Burden threshold, the
fare changes do not represent a Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers as the percentage point
difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%
threshold.

9 Cumulative Findings and Mitigations
Zero Fare for Youth aims to enhance the lives of RTD customers and communities by reducing transportation costs
for families. By inviting youth ages 19 and under to ride the bus and train at no cost, the program seeks to remove
barriers to education and employment, while creating access to destinations across the metro Denver region.
The proposed fare change for a permanent no cost fare for youth ages 19 and under do not appear to create any
Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear to create any Disproportionate Burdens on lowincome communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the implementation of the
proposed fare change.

10 Next Steps
It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
change upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
[This section will be completed once RTD’s Board of Directors has been made aware and considered this equity
analysis.]

Zero Fare for Youth Survey Analysis Report

1.E.1.a

Section I: Survey Methodology
The development of the Zero Fare for Youth survey effort began in Summer 2023. Originally, this effort
was to include a pre, mid, and post-test survey of a randomly selected group of students and their
families. To achieve this and considering it would be inappropriate for RTD to have access to school
contact lists, RTD sought out partnerships with numerous local school districts that would facilitate and
administer the survey’s distribution to the selected families. A representative sampling plan (by
enrollment) was developed by RTD and each district was provided with a random number sequence as
well as detailed instructions on how to apply these number sequences to their contact lists to select
the participating families. Unfortunately, engagement with all but one of the district representatives
seemingly ceased upon distribution of the random selection number sequences.
In an attempt to continue the collection of feedback and experiences of youth taking advantage of the
Zero Fare for Youth pilot, RTD decided to distribute this survey instrument to numerous youth-serving
organizations, recreation centers and libraries across RTD’s service area. At this point, the survey
ceased to be randomly selected, and became a self-selection study.
It should be noted that while the data collected in this effort is still valid feedback directly from RTD
customers and youths participating in Zero Fare for Youth pilot, and while general reporting and
comparative analysis can be and was performed on this data, predictive statistical analysis could not
be performed as this study did not contain a random sample of participants.
The survey itself consists of 31 questions and gathered feedback and information on: rider experience,
individual and household transit habits, and personal as well as household demographics. A total of
232 surveys were completed and the reporting and analysis of the survey responses are provided in
the next section.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Zero Fares on National Vote Early Day and Election Day
2024

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to implement
zero fares on October 29, 2024 (National Vote Early Day) and November 5, 2024 (General Election Day)
and to further authorize the biennial implementation of zero-fare days for each National Vote Early Day
and General Election Day thereafter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In July 2022, the Board approved the offering of zero-fare transit for National Vote Early Day (October
28, 2022) and General Election Day (November 8, 2022).
Data from the Survey of the Performance of American Elections from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab demonstrated that, in 2016, approximately 30 percent of
non-voters across the country claimed that the lack of transportation to the polls was a factor in
deciding not to vote. Among persons of color under the age of 30 responding to the survey, 38 percent
cited lack of transportation as a reason for not voting.
While research shows that Colorado’s system of all-mail ballot voting significantly increases voter
turnout both overall and for all major demographic groups, providing zero-fare transit during general
elections would further reduce barriers to polling place access, particularly among traditionally
disadvantaged voter groups. The Board of Directors’ adoption of a policy to provide system-wide zerofare transit on general election days would demonstrate the agency’s commitment to the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this Recommended Action, the Board continues the practice of authorizing zero-fare transit
for National Vote Early Day and General Election Day, both for 2024 and for future years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 86

1.E.2

The cumulative biennially occurring financial impact to provide zero-fare transit on National Vote Early
Day and General Election Day is approximately $494,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2010B Refunding

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution No. ____, Series of 2024, authorizing the
refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2010B.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt
service payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the essential assets of the District. Bonds and COPs are referred
to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either or tax-exempt or taxable. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2023, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.661 billion.

Packet Pg. 88

1.E.3

During the June 11, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff presented a discussion item
regarding a potential refunding of $100 million of RTD’s $400 million Build America Bonds (BABs) debt
portfolio. This portion of the BABs is held as obligations in the form of COPs. Refunding these COPs will
mitigate the financial risk exposure presented by the reduction in the federal interest rate subsidy which
reduces the net in interest cost to RTD. Since 2013, the federal government has paid a lower interest
rate subsidy than originally contemplated by RTD in issuing the BABs. Moreover, further future interest
rate subsidy reductions or possibly even elimination are subject to the federal budget sequestration
process.
Currently, only the $100 million of the $400 million BAB debt portfolio is attractive from a refunding
perspective; however, the additional $300 million will continue to be monitored for refunding
opportunities should market conditions warrant such action.
DISCUSSION
RTD and its municipal advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created opportunities
to take advantage of low interest rates.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2024 to refund the
currently outstanding COPs, Series 2010B, which are BABs. The related contractual documents required
to effectuate the refundings are identified in the Resolution and include:
•
•
•
•
•

The Preliminary Official Statement
The Lease
The Trust Indenture
The Continuing Disclosure Agreement
The Certificate Purchase Agreement

Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential Bond Refunding”. The Investor

Resolution No. __ delegates to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer or to the Chief Financial
Officer the authority (effective for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the Series
2024A refunding certificates of participation, provided that:
(a)
the aggregate principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant
to the Lease, as amended by the Third Amendment to Lease, shall not exceed $175,000,000;
(b)
the maximum annual amount of Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant to
the Lease, as amended by the Third Amendment to Lease, in any Fiscal Year shall not exceed
$21,500,000;

Packet Pg. 89

1.E.3

(c)
the Lease Term shall not extend beyond December 31, 2040, or the average useful
life of the Leased Property related to the Lease, whichever is shorter;
(d)
the maximum net effective interest rate on the interest component of the Base
Rentals relating to the 2024 Certificates shall not exceed 5.25%; and
(e)
the 2024 Refunding Project shall (i) not be required to result in net present value
savings at any percentage of the principal amount of the 2010B Certificates being refunded,
provided that the 2024 Refunding Project shall not result in a net present value loss as a
percentage of the principal amount of the 2010B Certificates being refunded worse than -4%,
and (ii) result in the District realizing a savings greater than zero measured on a gross basis,
without taking into account the present value or net present value of such savings.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Two benefits of this recommended COPs refunding transaction that will contribute to the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success:
1. Eliminate the risk that the BAB subsidy is further reduced or eliminated in the future; this risk has
a potential cost of up to $2.685 million per year through 2040 in relation to these COPs
2. Use existing COPs Series 2010B debt service reserve fund to reduce outstanding debt by
approximately $10 million

year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory
provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year
beyond the then current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment
with respect to the 2024 Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals
and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District
in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2024 Certificates shall
constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond
the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness
or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or
indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
2024 Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of
governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the
meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the
2024 Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond
those budgeted and appropriated for the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, as amended by the Third Amendment to
Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair
rental value of the 2010 Leased Property and do not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place
the District under an economic compulsion to renew the Lease or to exercise its option to
purchase the 2010 Leased Property pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the period during which the District has an option to purchase the 2010 Leased
Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the 2010
Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee for Refunded 2010B
Certificates. In the event that the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to
proceed with the 2024 Refunding Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the
provisions set forth herein, the Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on
the behalf and in the name of the District its option to redeem all or a portion of the 2010B
Certificates as set forth in the Sale Certificate (the "Refunded 2010B Certificates"), on the date
or dates and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate. Prior to the execution of
the Sale Certificate, the District hereby irrevocably instructs UMB Bank, n.a., as trustee for the
2010B Certificates, to give conditional notice of refunding and redemption to the Owners of the
Refunded 2010B Certificates in accordance with the provisions of the Sale Certificate and the
2010 Indenture. In accordance with the provisions of the 2010 Indenture, the District further
instructs the Trustee to recalculate the schedule of Base Rentals set forth in Exhibit B to the
Lease to reflect the principal amount and debt service requirements of the Certificates
outstanding after implementing the 2024 Refunding Project.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2024 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or

otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2024 Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 11.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2010 Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2010 Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Ticket Vending Machine Replacement Appropriation

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to appropriate $6,000,000 from the Unrestricted Fund for replacement of
Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs), which will be replenished with FTA Section 5339 grant funding.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD utilizes TVMs as one of many methods available to customers to purchase fares. TVMs are
primarily located on or near rail platforms; however, some TVMs are also available for use at bus
facilities along Flatiron Flyer routes. TVMs allow customers to purchase fare media in the form of paper
tickets using cash, credit or debit cards. Approximately $13 million (21%) of 2024 budgeted fare
revenue of $64 million is expected to be purchased with cash and the remainder purchased primarily
through electronic means.
Similar to bus fareboxes, TVMs provide customers with a viable alternative to electronic payments by
offering cash purchases for convenience as well as access for those who are unbanked. Offering
alternative payment options reduces barriers, particularly among traditionally disadvantaged groups.
Providing convenient, accessible payment options demonstrates the agency’s commitment to the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Due to the expansion of rail and Flatiron Flyer bus services with respect to the FasTracks program, RTD
currently deploys different TVM models, though all were manufactured by the same vendor. The use of
different models requires staff to utilize two different operating systems to support the TVMs.
RTD has 181 TVMs that are serviced and maintained by RTD’s Treasury Division within the Finance
Department. TVMs have a useful life expectancy of eight to 10 years. RTD’s total average age of TVMs
is 11.5 years, meaning that the majority of TVMs have exceeded their useful service life, resulting in a
shortage of spare parts and aging technology
A table depicting the age and location of TVMs throughout the rail network follows:

RTD initially began planning for TVM replacements in 2021, with a budget appropriation of
$12,000,000. This $12,000,000 has been included in the capital carryforward for each fiscal year as
RTD pursued additional analyses of the necessary number of replacement TVMs needed, while taking
into consideration equity impacts of reducing or moving TVM equipment. The estimated replacement
cost of $12,000,000, or approximately $50,000 per unit, was developed from current TVM equipment
replacement costs with RTD’s current vendor.
Staff recently completed an updated evaluation of replacement costs taking into consideration updated
specifications to ensure Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, compatibility with the ABT system,
improvements to equipment component resiliency and to allow for scalability for possible future
modifications such as ABT card reloads, contactless payments and fare media modifications.
This recent revaluation also factored in inflation and the current cost of TVM replacements, which is
now estimated to be approximately $18,000,000. This cost includes removal and installation costs,
additional parts, and a $1,000,000 project contingency.
As the Board has already appropriated $12,000,000 of the estimated $18,000,000 replacement cost,
this Recommended Action seeks appropriation of the additional $6,000,000 expenditure from the
Unrestricted Fund, which will be reimbursed with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Section 5339
grant funding.
FTA Section 5339 grants are discretionary apportionments for capital projects to replace, rehabilitate,
and purchase buses, vans and related equipment. Section 5339 apportionments are available to RTD,
and, pursuant to conversations with FTA representatives, TVM replacements qualify for this funding.
Upon the Board’s approval of this Recommended Action, staff anticipates an approximate 18-month
procurement and replacement process beginning in August 2024. This timeline aligns with statements
made to the state of Colorado and to Wells Fargo regarding RTD’s intent to achieve PCI compliance by
the end of 2025.

Packet Pg. 104

1.E.4

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The gross additional appropriation is $6,000,000, which amount will be offset with reimbursement from
Section 5339 grant funding resulting in no net additional cost to RTD.

Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Program
Benefits Administration Discontinuance

July 23, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2020, Colorado voters approved Proposition 118, the Family and Medical Leave Insurance
Program (FAMLI), which created a statewide paid family and medical leave insurance program. Employee
benefits under FAMLI are funded by a 0.9% premium on employee wages, split between the employee
and the employer. Private employers and the State of Colorado must participate in FAMLI, while local
governments like RTD have the option to opt out as discussed further below. Premium collections for
participating entities began January 2023, and benefits began January 2024.
FAMLI/Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Comparison
FAMLI is designed to supplement the federal FMLA, which provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks
of unpaid job-protected leave per year for specified reasons. FAMLI provides 12 weeks of paid leave per
year for the same reasons as FMLA, but goes beyond by:
•
•

•
•

Covering a percentage of an employee’s salary during the leave
Extending the definition of family member beyond immediate family to grandparents,
grandchildren, siblings and any other individual with whom the employee has a significant
personal bond
Providing safe leaves for the employee if they or a family member are the victim of domestic
violence, stalking, sexual assault or abuse
Providing an additional four weeks of leave for complications due to pregnancy or childbirth

FAMLI is designed to run concurrently with FMLA. Employees can use FAMLI and FMLA leaves for
circumstances covered by both laws. Eligible employees may take FAMLI related leave for circumstances
not covered by FMLA. Employers cannot require that an employee first use their accrued paid time off or
sick/vacation leave to be paid under FAMLI.
Employee eligibility for FAMLI is based on earnings, whereas FMLA eligibility is based on length of
employment. An employee becomes eligible for FAMLI after earning at least $2,500 in wages within the
previous four quarters, whereas an employee needs to be employed by the same employer for at least

Packet Pg. 117

1.F.1

12 months and must have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours to be eligible for FMLA. An employee who
elects FAMLI coverage must commit to participating in the program for three years.
Paid benefits under FAMLI equate to 90 percent of the State Average Weekly Wage (SAWW) plus 50
percent of the employee’s wages above SAWW, up to a $1,100 weekly max. As of July 2024, the
SAWW annual salary equivalent is $76,509.68.
Local Government FAMLI Participation
Local governments have three options under the FAMLI provisions:
1. Participate fully;
2. Decline participation fully; or
3. Decline employer participation and provide an alternative.
A local government that elects to fully participate in FAMLI must remain in the program and agree to pay
premiums for a minimum of three years. An employee of a local government that has declined
participation is still eligible to elect coverage, pay 50 percent of the required premium (0.45% of wages),
and receive full FAMLI benefits although the local government makes no premium contribution.
During the October 25, 2022, Board Meeting, the Board of Directors elected to decline participation for
the employer, which has allowed employees to decide what is in their best interests.
With the commencement of FAMLI benefits on January 1, 2024, the number of participating RTD
employees has risen steadily each month this year. As of July 2024, 80 RTD employees have opted to
enroll in FAMLI. RTD has been providing administrative support to these employees by deducting and
remitting the employee share of premiums and submitting wage data to the Division of Family and
Medical Leave, Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (Division), which administers the
program. Wage reports and premiums must be remitted to the Division on a quarterly basis.
DISCUSSION
2024 FAMLI Administration Challenges
When RTD initially committed to providing administrative support for participating employees, staff
believed the Division would permit the agency to submit consolidated wage reports and lump sum
premium payments on behalf of all participating RTD employees. In Q2 2024, however, staff learned
that the new FAMLI online services portal requires RTD to access each employee’s individual account
and manually input gross wages and subject wages. The system then requires the agency to access a
separate portion of the employee’s account to remit a premium payment on their behalf. Making
payment requires RTD to manually enter its bank account number and routing number. The process must
be repeated for each participating employee. Manually repeating this process for each employee is time
consuming and creates an increased risk for error. It is estimated that payroll personnel spend
approximately fifteen minutes submitting wage reports and making payment on behalf of each enrolled
employee.

Packet Pg. 118

1.F.1

Also in Q2 2024, staff also learned for the first time that participating employees would be required to
link their individual My FAMLI+ Employer portal accounts to RTD. This provides RTD payroll with the
required authorization to transfer wage data and make payment on behalf of employees. As of one week
prior to the first quarter payment deadline, only four of the more than 60 employees participating at that
time had linked their accounts to the agency. Accordingly, multiple staff members invested substantial
time providing participating employees with information concerning their obligation to link their individual
portal accounts to RTD. Despite RTD’s efforts, approximately nine employees did not successfully link
their accounts prior to the payment deadline, which precluded RTD from remitting premium payments
and wage data on their behalf before the deadline. Multiple employees communicated that their inability
to link their accounts to RTD resulted from technical difficulties on the Division’s website. These
complications caused an interruption in benefits for some employees and may result in late fees.
Nevertheless, RTD has continued to contact employees in an effort to remit payment for the first quarter
on their behalf.
Several employees reported to RTD that Division representatives advised them to remit premium
payments on their own even though RTD has been making deductions from their paychecks to cover the
premiums. These types of inaccurate communications have made it difficult for RTD to comply with
FAMLI requirements and support its employees’ access to benefits.
Unfortunately, there has been no improvement in the Division’s online portal process following the
second quarter payment deadline. As of July 2024, RTD has been unable to remit payment on behalf of
22 employees for the second quarter. Most of the second quarter payment issues again relate to
technical difficulties with the FAMLI website or employees who have failed to properly link their
accounts to RTD, despite RTD’s outreach efforts.
Further complicating matters, at various times the FAMLI portal has indicated that RTD must submit
retroactive payments for employees, dating back to 2023. RTD has been advised by a Division
representative that when an employee enrolls in FAMLI and elects retroactive benefits, the employee is
responsible for submitting back payments to cover the period of their retroactive election. Although
these retroactive premiums were displayed on the RTD FAMLI portal account, RTD was verbally
instructed it should not collect or remit these premiums on behalf of employees, which has caused
additional confusion.
When RTD requested guidance concerning these ongoing challenges, Division staff recommended that
RTD consider terminating its efforts to provide administrative support to its employees. Based on
information obtained from the Division, as of May 2023, 1,321 local governments had opted out of
FAMLI. As of January 2024, 229 local governments opted out of FAMLI but agreed to provide
administrative support. As of July 2024, however, only 58 of those local governments continue to
provide administrative support.
Discontinuance of FAMLI Administration
Although RTD has undertaken significant efforts to administratively support employees who participate
in FAMLI, the online portal system limitations related to the submission of wage data and premium

Packet Pg. 119

1.F.1

payments make it difficult for RTD to effectively do so. Based on FAMLI enrollment numbers through the
beginning of 2024, it is likely an increasing number of employees will continue to elect coverage. Thus,
the administrative challenges related to submitting wage reports and premiums will continue to increase.
It is anticipated that discontinuing the administration of FAMLI benefits will result in fewer employees
experiencing payment issues and benefits interruption.
Following the end of the Q3 2024, RTD will no longer provide FAMLI administrative support to enrolled
employees. RTD employees will be permitted to continue to voluntarily participate in FAMLI but will
coordinate directly with the Division in providing all required information and payments.
RTD will provide communication to employees regarding this new process including reference materials
available on the internal agency website and also continue to assist employees with guidance regarding
FAMLI participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will incur no financial impact in terminating administrative support of FAMLI.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF)

July 23, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) is the financial forecast used as the basis for the
development of the 2025 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The
FYFF was formerly the six-year Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous financial
forecast, the 2024-2029 MTFP, was approved by the Board in October 2023.
The 2025-2029 FYFF is prepared using currently available information to assist in planning and
modification of the Fiscal Policy, if necessary, within projected financial constraints.
This Discussion Item is provided in advance of the September 10, 2024, Finance and Planning
Committee during which staff will present a Recommended Action to approve the 2025-2029 FYFF,
which will include projected cash flows and fund balances over five years. The FYFF is a forecast or
projection of financial results and is not an appropriation of funds and is non-binding.
DISCUSSION
The 2025-2029 FYFF is being prepared using currently available information and does not include
assumptions regarding future potential changes such as passage of the November 5, 2024 Taxpayer’s
Bill of Rights (TABOR) ballot question or new grant funding from SB24-230 Oil and Gas Production Fees.
The FYFF will only include funding source and use projections that have reasonable certainty to occur in
accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal Policy.
In consideration of the Back-to-Basics Strategic Initiative, staff has engaged with an external consultant
over the past year to evaluate and enhance RTD’s financial planning process. The recommendations
from the consultant will be phased from 2024-2027. In addition, staff has met with other transit
agencies to evaluate and incorporate best practices in RTD’s financial planning processes.

Packet Pg. 121

1.F.2

During 2024, staff has implemented financial planning activities including monthly and quarterly
departmental financial reviews, continued refinement of capital carryforward, cross-departmental
planning collaboration, improvements to asset maturity information and coordination between the
financial planning process and 2021-2026 Strategic Planning process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2025-2029 FYFF projected cash flows and fund balances will be provided at the September 10,
2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting and will adhere to the Fiscal Policy requirements and
reflect ongoing fiscal sustainability and Financial Success through 2029.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Draft 2025 Fiscal Policy

July 23, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Policy establishes annually the financial control framework and governance of the agency’s
financial resources for that year. Staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy annually for the Board’s
consideration for the upcoming fiscal year. The Fiscal Policy determines the parameters within which the
Proposed Annual Budget is developed as well as parameters within which financial activities are
performed.
Once approved by the Board of Directors, the Fiscal Policy may be amended by the Board at any time;
the most recent modification was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2023 for the 2024
fiscal year.
Proposed changes to the Fiscal Policy are recommended to the Board to address current and emerging
issues including those that result from regulatory, compliance, legislative, audit, Board-directed, fiscal
sustainability, best practices or other requisite sources.
Staff presented a 2025 Fiscal Policy Discussion Item to the Finance and Planning Committee on
Tuesday, May 14, 2024, that provided initial proposed modifications for Board consideration.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Discussion Item is to continue conversations with the Board to establish
recommended modifications to the Fiscal Policy for 2025.
Recognizing that the Board approved a TABOR ballot question on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, for the
Tuesday, November 5, 2024, General Election seeking voter approval for continuation of the existing
TABOR exemption, modifications to the 2025 Fiscal Policy contemplate that TABOR revenue growth
limitations will be in effect beginning in 2025. Should voters approve the TABOR ballot question on
Tuesday, November 5, 2024, staff will subsequently propose additional 2025 Fiscal Policy modifications
as a result.

Packet Pg. 140

1.F.3

Preliminary recommendations for modifications to the Fiscal Policy are included in the attached
presentation and red-line Draft 2025 Fiscal Policy document. These recommendations include the
following:

•

•

•

•

Revenue Policies
o Pursuit of revenue diversification opportunities to mitigate financial risk
o Ensuring accounting treatment is applied in the most effective manner for TABOR
mitigation
Capital Improvement Policies
o Additional clarification regarding Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan information to be
provided in the budgeting and forecasting process
Fund Balance Policies
o Enhancing the policy documentation regarding the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA)
o Adding a reserve fund for projected TABOR refunds to be included in the annual budget
appropriation
Budget and Financial Forecast Policies
o Additional minimum budget report contents to include comparative cash flows and
beginning and ending projected fund balances
o Incorporating Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) budgeting best practices

Staff will provide a recommended 2025 Fiscal Policy for Board consideration in October 2024, which
will incorporate modifications discussed with the Finance and Planning Committee on Tuesday, May 14
and Tuesday, July 23, 2024, in addition to any recommendations from the Office of the State Auditor’s
2023-2024 performance audit with which RTD agrees.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impacts associated with this item will be determined through discussions with the Board and
included in the 2025 Fiscal Policy Recommended Action to be presented to the Board in October 2024.
