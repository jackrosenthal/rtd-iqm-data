#### 1. Recommendation for Adoption of ADA Program Plan

It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board of Directors affirms that it is a priority of RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to further this policy direction.

Discussion:              Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, stated that the action tonight is requesting the Board adopt the foundation for the ADA program that has been discussed over the past few months.  This item inventories the services provided by RTD and addresses the need to coordinate those services.  Kenn Hardin noted that ADA falls into four categories or components with regards to employment, communication, facilities and service.  He explained that this is a foundational plan that he will then use to develop the specific components to allow RTD to provide the best services for people with disabilities.

Director Hoy asked for clarification about what this policy changes.  He thought that RTD was already complying with ADA requirements.  Kenn Hardin explained that this created a coordinated effort that RTD did not have previously.  It identifies an ADA Coordinator from the Civil Rights Division that was not in place previously.  He said that right now RTD has functional ADA activities, everyone is doing some level of compliance, but there is no oversight of the activity.  General Manager Washington noted that in addition the Board is affirming that ADA is a priority for RTD.  He stressed that the main point of this action is to send a message to the disabled community that this is a priority.

Director Hoy noted that the Board would not be setting up committees; the Board is simply affirming that the Board is in support of the ADA laws of the Government.  He said that RTD does that now but this is just reaffirming the commitment.  Marla Lien explained that this is actually going a step beyond that.  ADA requirements are prescriptive; they say how to design buses, design facilities, grade curbs, etc.  She stated that this is an overall policy that will take RTD a step beyond the prescriptive requirements of the ADA laws.

Director Hoy asked if RTD does not have this program today.  Marla Lien said that RTD complies with ADA but this will hopefully take the agency beyond looking at the prescriptive requirements to have a more holistic approach.

Committee Chair Deadwyler commented that when she first saw this item she was also a little confused; however, this is the first time the agency has stated it is one of RTD’s priorities.  She noted that while RTD complied with ADA, we never assured the public it was a priority.

Director Tobiassen stated that this is a huge step forward.  He said that for the last five years he has run into issues with ADA and RTD where we did not take the next step, for example the website or Board packets not being accessible.  He recognized that RTD has been working in this direction but thinks formalizing a policy is great.  Director Tobiassen noted that staff is more than happy to work to improve RTD but this makes it easier to look at those hurdles.

Director Folska thanked Kenn Hardin and all the staff for their enterprise wide efforts.  She believes this is an important move.  Director Folska is excited to see the shift from silos to a fully integrated system.

Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked Kenn Hardin and staff as well.  She believes this will make people feel more secure now that RTD has indicated that ADA is a priority.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 26, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
