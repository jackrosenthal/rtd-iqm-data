#### 1. Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for a share of the 16th Street Maintenance (Blocks 1-13)

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for the shared maintenance cost of the 13 block portion of the 16th Street Mall between Broadway and Market Street. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to share the cost of maintaining the granite pavers, curbs and transition stones within the transitway.

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, stated that this in an IGA to get reimbursed by the City and County of Denver (CCD) for work done on the 16th Street Mall.  He introduced Jeff Cluphf who manages the 16th Street Mall Maintenance for RTD.  Jeff Cluphf explained that this IGA covers the granite portion of the 16th Street Mall, curb-to-curb.  He said that staff has been working with the CCD for several years to try to negotiate some cost sharing for the maintenance.  This has resulted in the CCD agreeing to pay 30% of the maintenance costs up to $300K annually.  He noted that this is much better participation by the City than we have had in the past.

Director Menten asked for further information as to why RTD was responsible for maintenance.  She noted the case RTD vs. Weaver in 1987 when RTD took over the responsibility.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that RTD contracted for the creation of the Mall and got one of the first UMPTA grants to fund it.  There was a defect allegation against the architects in which a settlement was reached requiring the architectural firm to create a fund that would take care of the Mall maintenance for 30 years.  She said as part of the settlement there was an agreement between RTD and CCD that RTD would take care of the maintenance for the duration of the fund; however, the fund is running out.

Director Lubow asked if staff has ever thought about getting local businesses to share in the cost of the Free Mall Shuttle.  General Manager Washington stated that staff has thought of that and they have not given up on the idea.  He said that staff has been asking that for a number of years.  This IGA is due to staff’s efforts to finally get CCD to contribute which is a big step forward.  He stated that staff would continue to pursue funding from the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) and local businesses.  Henry Stopplecamp noted that the local businesses are responsible for cleaning, snow removal, sidewalks, trees, etc.  He stated the only thing they do not take care of is the actual pavers.

Chair Sisk asked if there are advertising revenues that can be generated from this 13 block area of the mall.  Henry Stopplecamp said that because we only have the 10 foot area the buses travel there really is not an advertising opportunity.  Marla Lien noted that the Mall Shuttle itself does generate significant advertising dollars.

Director Menten wanted to confirm that we would not be doing something like granite pavers on 18th and 19th as part of the Free MetroRide.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that we would not be doing anything other than concrete and asphalt.

Committee Chair James noted that no one has suggested anything different be put in on 18th and 19th.  He asked staff for more information on the capital improvement program that is taking place on the 16th Street Mall.  Jeff Cluphf explained that this is a project with CCD, DDP and RTD.  CCD and DDP are paying 2/3.  He said this will consist of bulb outs, improved lighting, improved paving, etc. and will incorporate some of the lessons learned from the 2011 pilot program.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### C. Other Matters

General Manager Washington said that as the Board is aware, there was concern the previous week that the Platte Bus Barn facility needed some work to shore up some structural defects.  He said that staff did do this on a temporary basis and are working to fix it on a permanent basis.  He stated that staff erred on the side of safety and evacuated the buses and employees in the affected area.  He thanked staff for their responsiveness to the situation.

Director Daly asked where the extra buses were housed.  General Manager Washington said they were parked outside for a short time.  Henry Stopplecamp noted that the facility was back in service at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday so the normal Monday service was out of that facility.

Director Daly asked if there were any conclusions as to what caused the structural defects.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that staff is working with an engineering firm to conduct a thorough assessment of what caused the issue and how to best permanently fix it.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 8:09 p.m.
