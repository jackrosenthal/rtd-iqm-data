#### 1. Civil Rights Committee Update

Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for the Civil Rights Division introduced Adrina Gibson as the new Manager for the Small Business Office (SBO).  Zamy Silva mentioned that Adrina Gibson started with RTD as an intern in 2007 and has been moving through the ranks since then.  She last served as the I-225 Compliance Manager.  Zamy Silva said she has confidence in Adrina Gibson’s leadership of the SBO team.

Zamy Silva introduced Ed Neuberg, Manager for RTD’s American with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office.  She noted that tonight’s update will focus on the ADA Office.  She added that the last part of the update, captured on a slide title “Departmental Civil Rights Division Updates”, contained general updates on the Civil Rights Division.  In the interest of time, she invited the Directors to email her any questions on those items.  The slide, along with the rest of the ADA Office Update presentation, was included in the Civil Rights Committee agenda packet for August 11, 2015.

Ed Neuberg reviewed the ADA Office Update presentation.  The review included the Highlights of the ADA Office since he joined RTD in April, 2015, as well as Trainings and Outreach and Next Steps as the ADA Office moves forward.

Ed Neuberg highlighted the ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration on July 25th, in which Director Folska was a featured speaker.  He pointed out that his office is in the process of creating an Internal ADA Manual for RTD for all departments to have as a reference.  He noted that the 2016 National ADA Symposium will be held in Denver with RTD as one of the organizing partners.  Ed Neuberg mentioned that this was the first time the National ADA Symposium has partnered with a transit agency.  He added that his office will be performing RTD facility evaluations for ADA compliance in the near future.

Director Folska thanked Ed Neuberg for the update.  She noted that it took RTD 25 years to create an ADA Manager position.   She said she was glad that Ed Neuberg is in that position.  She was sorry to miss him during the ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration as she asked for him and could not find him.

Director Folska asked Ed Neuberg to include the newer facilities, like Denver Union Station (DUS), at the top of the list of the ADA compliance evaluations.  She noted that even though the architects and engineers who worked on DUS reviewed facility for ADA compliance, once finished the facility was not compliant.  Dave Genova, Interim General Manager who was then serving as the Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and Facilities, previously said that his team would study the facility.  Director Folska mentioned that she talked to Jadwiga Brown, Orientation and Mobility Specialist/Vision Rehabilitation Therapist for the State of Colorado during the ADA 25th Anniversary Celebration.  Jadwiga Brown brought to her attention that DUS is still not compliant.  Director Folska acknowledged that the list of facilities is long and that the ADA compliance evaluation of RTD’s facilities is a big job.

Director Folska brought to the Committee’s attention the article titled “Reflecting on the Impact of Americans with Disabilities Act Signed 25 Years Ago”, published by the Denver Post on July 26, 2012.  The article stated that the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is 83%.  She noted that even if it was at 60%, which was the last percentage available on this statistic, she wanted to see RTD’s resources for overall hiring, training, educating, and also recruiting for the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program, available for people with disabilities.  Ed Neuberg mentioned that he was not aware of the article or the 83% figure as the last statistic available to his understanding was 60%.  Ed Neuberg added that the Civil Rights Division is working with RTD’s Human Resources to provide ADA training to new hires as well as to make the New Hire Training ADA accessible.  Zamy Silva mentioned that the WIN Program is working to make all its documents ADA accessible.  She pointed out that her team has met with Brenda Mosby, who had contacted the Civil Rights Division previously regarding the accessibility of the WIN Program documentation, to ensure that her concerns are being addressed.  Director Folska asked if Brenda Mosby has been hired by RTD.  Zamy Silva replied that Brenda Mosby does not work for RTD; however, her team is proactively seeking her feedback as she has raised some of these concerns in the past.  Zamy Silva pointed out that making the WIN Program ADA accessible has been a little difficult due to the nature of the work available: short term and dependent on projects.  She wants to ensure that employment under the WIN Program for ADA participants is feasible and long term.  Director Folska noted that it is important to make all types of jobs available and leave it up to the person to decide if they are interested in a specific opportunity.  She added that the history of people with disabilities in the United States is long and deep and that RTD could benefit from an overview of this history and the role that the Agency gets to play in Denver and the state of Colorado.  She noted that transportation is the backbone to individuals with disabilities in reaching full potential and full access to public life at the same level as everyone else.  She noted that disabled people need to be equally at the table.

Director Francone shared her excitement about the 2016 National ADA Symposium coming to Denver.  She asked staff to keep her updated as she would like to participate.

Director Francone asked if the Internal ADA Manual will add new legal responsibilities to RTD.  Ed Neuberg said that the manual will reflect ADA policies.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, confirmed that RTD will not be creating new policies.  Zamy Silva added that RTD has several departments that interface with ADA policies and the intent is to unify the process and have one accessible document for the Agency.

Committee Chair Walker noted that he has interacted with Ed Neuberg on a number of constituents’ concerns and thanked him for his quick responses.
