Subject:

2019 Access-a-Cab Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to provide a subsidy
for Access-a-Cab for calendar year 2019.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
In March 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-a-Ride
program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers may schedule same day trips with participating taxi companies. Current
participating companies are Metro/Yellow Transportation, zTrip, Green Taxi, and Union Taxi. All persons
using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use RTD paratransit service.
The service provided is not RTD-branded transit service but rather taxi trips subsidized by RTD. The
passenger pays the total cost of the trip, and RTD provides a subsidy. The current subsidy is $12.00 per
trip.
The Access-a-Cab program has proved to be very popular. It is also beneficial to RTD because RTD pays
a smaller subsidy per ride than trips taken on the RTD-operated Access-a-Ride service. Trips taken by
those passengers on the regular Access-a-Ride service costs RTD an average of $67.00 per trip, as
opposed to$12.00.
In 2018, Access-a-Cab provided approximately 137,662 cab trips at a total cost to RTD of $1,651,944.
While we do not know whether those same trips would have been taken on Access-a-Ride, if those same
trips had been taken on Access-a-Ride, the total cost to RTD would have been approximately,
$9,223,354.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The budget for 2019 is as follows: Metro/Yellow $1,800,000, zTrip, $75,000, Green Taxi $150,000,
and Union Taxi, $435,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab service is budgeted annually based on
ridership and anticipated demand and must be approved by the RTD Board of Directors on an annual
basis.
Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2019 recommended budget. Funds for Accessa-Cab service in future years will be requested as part of the budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
provide a subsidy for Access-a-Cab for calendar year 2019.
2. Do not approve the recommended action for the Access-a-Cab program and attempt to absorb
the increase in ridership onto the Access-a-Ride program at an increased subsidy per boarding.
This alternative is not recommended as it has the potential of raising the cost of Access-a-Ride
services.

Non-urbanized

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for non-urbanized services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County. These
Agreements are for calendar year 2019 and for amounts not to exceed $387,271.00 for Boulder
County, $380,813.00 for Adams County and $135,243.00 for Jefferson County.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU),
along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized (i.e.,
rural) areas. The section of the Act that addressed the provision of services in non-urbanized areas was
called Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEALU provisions were moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21)
and the specific provisions regarding 5311 funding changed. Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to
various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas
of the District and to provide local match money for federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311
(non-urbanized) services in the District. RTD has provided financial assistance for the provision of nonurbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial assistance for the provision
of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $387,271.00 in 2019. RTD shall also contribute funding
to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount
not to exceed $380,813.00 in 2019.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $135,243.00 in 2019.
Non-urbanized service performance will be assessed at the end of each year to determine if performance
expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreements is warranted.
Performance is evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will
not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it
into conformance. The provision of non-urbanized service in 2018 (thru August) resulted in monthly
performance that ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

boarding ranging from approximately $.87 to approximately $4.61 (subsidy reflects only the RTD
contribution).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the non-urbanized services is included in the recommended 2019 RTD
budget and is subject to formal budget adoption. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for non-urbanized services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson
County.
These Agreements are for calendar year 2019 and for amounts not to exceed
$387,271.00 for Boulder County, $380,813.00 for Adams County and $135,243.00 for Jefferson
County.
2.
Do not approve the funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination
of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties
which would have a negative impact on the individuals that depend on this service.

DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD financial support
and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $780,000.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry between six (6) to twelve (12) riders, and
the vehicles are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render
regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools
eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, RTD and DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of
2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed
that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable
mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area.
Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus
routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and
increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.3

advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
93 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI (Enterprise) took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the
vanpools carry an average of 5.5 riders per van and the fleet is at 77% capacity.
Vanpool performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations
have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreement is warranted. DRCOG vanpool
performance through September 2018 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat of
approximately $3.09.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the DRCOG vanpool program is included in the recommended 2019 budget
and is subject to formal budget adoption. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Provide RTD financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the
Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not
to exceed $780,000.
2.
Do not approve the financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program.
This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would eliminate this transportation option for
residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area
and could result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

City of Englewood Trolley Cost Share

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
Englewood Trolley circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year
2019 and is for an amount not to exceed $433,738.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The service, named the “art shuttle,” was implemented in 2004 as
a free service. In September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, RTD took over funding of
the art shuttle because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood
continued the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood also covered all
marketing and related expenses. In 2018, the City of Englewood gave the art shuttle a new name and
look – The Englewood Trolley. The Englewood Trolley shuttle continues to be a free service that is
sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would
have been paid if the Englewood Trolley charged a RTD fare.
The Englewood Trolley currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service
on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. For 2019, RTD has agreed to extend the hours of operation from
6:30 AM to 8:00 PM for one year. This extension of hours is being implemented to accommodate
employees at Swedish Medical Center and Craig Hospital where shifts end at 7:30 PM. The Englewood
Trolley operates between the Englewood light rail station and Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital.
The Englewood Trolley operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15) to twenty (20) minute frequency.
Ridership has averaged 649.0 boardings per day or 26.3 passengers per hour thru 2018 3rd Quarter.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the Englewood Trolley
in an amount not to exceed $433,738 in 2019.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the Englewood Trolley will be
assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to
determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in
terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation,
RTD and the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.4

conformance. The provision of the Englewood Trolley service through the 3rd Quarter in 2018 resulted
in 26.3 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per Englewood Trolley passenger trip of $1.91. The
City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the Englewood Trolley.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the Englewood Trolley is included in the recommended 2019 RTD budget and
is subject to formal budget adoption. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support
for the operation of the Englewood Trolley circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This
agreement is for calendar year 2019 and is for an amount not to exceed $433,738.
2.
Do not approve entering into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood. This course
of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the Englewood
Trolley circulator service which would have a negative impact on the residents, visitors and
businesses in the City of Englewood.

City of Boulder Hop Cost Share

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at
Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2019 and is for
an amount not to exceed $1,559,509.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday. RTD staff has been working with the City staff in a Hop redesign
planned originally for 2018. Part of the redesign has taken place with the remainder planned for 2019.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,559,509 in 2019.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will
confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through the 2nd Quarter of 2018 resulted in 22.4 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP
passenger trip of $1.93.

2. Do not approve entering into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder. This course of
action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP
circulator service which would have a negative impact on the residents, students and businesses in
the City of Boulder.

Bus Donation to Flat Rock Law Enforcement
Training Facility

Safety,

Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the donation of a 40 foot bus that has reached the end of its useful life, to the Flatrock Training
Center to provide a permanent asset for regional law enforcement and first responder training.
The recommended action proposed supports the following GM Goals:
Core Goal #5 Effective Communications and Community Outreach
DISCUSSION
RTD is required to conduct Emergency Preparedness Drills and Exercises throughout the year to ensure
local /regional first responders are familiar with and adequately trained to respond to emergencies on
RTD vehicles. This requirement is a part of the new Safety Management System Regulations 49 CFR
Part 674 and 673 and our goal to be better prepared for emergency response. RTD receives requests
throughout the year to provide a bus for such training and currently we must pull a bus to provide that
training.
The donation of this bus to the Flatrock facility will provide a permanent asset for all local and regional
first responder agencies to train to better respond to emergencies that involve RTD buses. The Flatrock
training facility is currently used by over 50 agencies (list attached) in the Denver Metro and surrounding
communities; and is open to all agencies. This donation will benefit RTD’s employees and customers by
having better trained first responders in the event of an emergency anywhere in the District.
The Procedure for Disposal of Vehicles in the Procurement Manual states buses will be sent to auction
when they reach the end of their useful life. There is also a procedure in the Procurement Manual that
allows for donations to charitable organizations:
1.4.7 Donation to Charitable Organizations. Under special circumstances, donation to charitable
organizations can be considered. If the items were purchased with Federal funds, FTA permission
must be obtained. If purchased with only RTD funds, Board of Directors’ approval will be
requested.
The bus that will be selected for donation was not purchased with Federal funds and therefore a
Board of Directors action can authorize this donation to the Flatrock Training facility.
FINANICAL IMPACT
RTD typically receives between $500 to $1500 for each bus at auction.

training.
2. Do not approve the donation of the bus to Flatrock, sell it at auction, and continue to pull buses out of
service throughout the year to ensure adequate first responder training.

Re:

Service Availability - October 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.49% of all scheduled hours of bus service in October 2018. Lost
service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a decrease during the month of October over the same month last
year. Although lost service year to date is higher, a large portion of lost services occurred during the first half of

2018. Service delivery has improved significantly since June 2018. Lost services are summarized as follows:





October 2018 – 419.61 hours
October 2017 – 1,105.31 hours
Year to date hours for 2017 – 5,185.36 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 9,747.86 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.49% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it was necessary to cover
2,536 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled days off). This represents approximately 20,288 hours
of service being provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev. This number is also trending downward with this October numbers lower
than October of last year.

Other items to note include improvements in the vacancy rate, recruitment numbers and retention numbers over 2017.
Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in October was a University of Colorado A-line and B-line service disruption

ADA Expert Review – Third Annual Report
October 2018

In March of 2014, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) entered into a joint
Settlement Agreement in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the securement area on
board RTD fixed-route buses for passengers who use mobility aids. At that time, RTD adopted a policy
to ensure individuals who use mobility aids, including wheelchairs, have equal access to the securement
area on board fixed-route buses. The key components of the policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items (such as strollers) must be collapsed prior to boarding, and non-disabled passengers
must use the seats behind the securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, non-disabled
passengers will not be allowed to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding at bus stops

An additional requirement of the Settlement Agreement was for RTD to retain the services of an “ADA
Expert” to periodically review, audit, and prepare several written reports to ensure that RTD
implemented and was enforcing the policy required by the Agreement.
The ADA Expert submitted the “Initial Expert Report” which was shared with the Board of Directors in
November of 2014; the “Mid-Year Report” which was shared with the Board of Directors in September
of 2015; the “First Annual Report” which was shared with the Board of Directors in July of 2016; and
the “Second Annual Report” which was shared with the Board of Directors in August of 2017.
In August, 2018, KFH Group, Inc., of Bethesda, Maryland, (the “ADA Expert”) returned to Denver for
the purpose of preparing the third of three “Annual Reports” as required by the Settlement Agreement.
The “Third Annual Report” was prepared based on data collected by KFH Group, and it included
interviews with RTD staff personnel, representatives of CCDC, members of the disability community,
and observations made while riding several RTD buses. A review was also conducted on the current
Securement Area Report (passenger pass-up data) and ADA-related customer complaints for fixed-route
bus service.
The conclusions presented by KFH Group, Inc., stated that “RTD’s efforts in implementing the
Settlement Agreement requirements demonstrate that RTD has improved fixed route bus service for
riders with mobility aids and specifically improvements in ensuring access to the securement areas.”
Although the ADA Expert did not identify any formal deficiencies, the ADA Expert recommended that
RTD continue to follow the on-going requirements that were implemented as a result of the Settlement

Agreement to ensure continued improvement and access for passengers using mobility aids.
specific procedures recommended for continuing are as follows:

The






Continue to use the ADA Pass-Up form by bus operators.
Continue to collect and capture the data elements for the Securement Area Report.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
This report is the third of three Annual Reports required by the Settlement Agreement
(Agreement) between the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) and the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) of Denver dated February 2014.
As background, the CCDC filed a lawsuit in 2013 asserting violation of Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended. The matter
was resolved with the February 2014 Agreement that set out specific requirements for the RTD.
The term for the Agreement began with its execution by CCDC and RTD in late February 2014
and was to continue for three years thereafter.
Among the requirements of the Agreement, the RTD was to retain an expert consultant
qualified in and experienced with ADA compliance with fixed route bus service and otherwise
unaffiliated with the RTD (“ADA Expert”) to review and audit RTD’s implementation and
enforcement of the Policy required through the Agreement and to prepare specified reports.
The Policy, titled Boarding Individuals with Disabilities Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access,
is included in Appendix A to this report. The purpose of the Policy as set out in the Agreement
is: “RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including Wheelchairs, have equal
access to its buses and to the Securement Areas.”
The KFH Group has served as the ADA Expert, reviewing RTD's implementation and
enforcement of the Policy and monitoring the data reporting required of the RTD. Our review
and assessment of RTD’s efforts have been documented in the following submitted reports, as
required by the Agreement:

This current report is the third and final Annual Report required of the ADA Expert according
to the Agreement.
Our tasks to prepare the Third Annual Report, which reviews data and efforts during 2017, are
similar to those for prior Annual Reports and include:


Summary

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REQUIRED REPORTING
The Agreement requires that RTD monitor bus operators’ compliance with the Policy in two
ways: (1) completion of the “CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report”
(Securement Area Report), and (2) through a “Complaint Process” concerning the Policy. RTD
also monitors its bus service through deployment of Street Supervisors and its Undercover Ride
Check Program.
The Securement Area Reports are to document each time that a bus operator presses the ADA
PAX PASS-UP button and each time that a passenger complains that a bus operator has
violated the Policy. Specific data are required to be reported in both cases.
For each instance when the operator presses the ADA PAX PASS-UP button, for example, RTD
is to document the date and time, route number and stop location, time the next bus on the
that route is due, whether a transfer was offered to the rider being passed up and whether it
was accepted, among other details. The Securement Area Reports—large spreadsheets—are
then made available to the CCDC, Denver Regional Mobility Access Council, and posted on the
RTD website. We note that as of September 2018, the most recent Securement Area Report
shown by link on the RTD website documents data for calendar year 2015. Reports for calendar
years 2016 and 2017 have been completed.

Summary data from the Securement Area Reports completed since the execution of the
Agreement are shown in Table 1. For each of five time periods, the table shows the number of
ADA Pass-Ups categorized by the reason for the Pass-Ups, with a total for each time period.
Note that the first two time periods are less than one year: the Agreement required a
Securement Area Report within 90 days after the Settlement became effective, with this data
shown in the first column of Table 1 and the remainder of 2014 shown in the second column.
Securement Area Report for 2017
The most recent Securement Area Report covers all of calendar year 2017 and its data is
reviewed in this report.
A total of 720 PASS-UPs was reported for 2017. Of those, 620—86% of the total—occurred
because the two wheelchair securement areas were already occupied, by either two riders with
wheelchairs, one rider with a wheelchair and a second rider with a different mobility aid, or
two riders each with a mobility aid other than a wheelchair. With the securement areas
occupied, there is thus no room on the bus for another rider with a wheelchair.
Of all Pass-Ups in 2017, 42 or 6% of the total occurred because the wheelchair lift was not
operable and therefore the rider could not board. As shown in Table 1, the number of Pass-Ups
for this reason has decreased over the past three years. It will continue to decrease as RTD
phases out buses with wheelchair lifts and procures new buses that are equipped with a ramp
rather than a lift. Ramps have a simpler design than lifts and they are less prone to
breakdowns.
Another 6% of the Pass-Ups are shown as “Other.” We reviewed all of these, looking for any
patterns, and categorized those where the reason for “other” appeared the same or very similar.

6 Incidents—Two riders using mobility devices are traveling together and could not be
accommodated as one of the securement areas was already occupied by a rider with a
wheelchair or other mobility device.
5 Incidents—The bus operator reports that the seats over the securement area could not
be raised.
3 Incidents—Ambulatory rider seating in seats over the securement area refuses to
move.
3 Incidents—Rider using an electric wheelchair could not board as the wheelchair had
no power.
2 Incidents—Rider with oversize/overweight wheelchair unable to board.
2 Incidents—Snow or large object obstructing the bus stop and the operator could not
safely deploy the lift to allow boarding.

The five incidents where the seats over the securement area could not be raised deserve note.
Perhaps these were anomalies in 2017. Bus operators’ pre-trip inspections include checking the
seats over the securement areas to ensure that the securement areas will be available during
service. And RTD reports that bus operator training includes hands-on experience with each
type of bus the operators drive and that the training specifically covers the pre-trip inspection
of the securement areas. The inspection includes checking seats—lifting the seats or, for the
over-the-road coaches, moving the seats forward to allow access to the securement areas.
Despite this, the incidents in 2017 suggest that this pre-trip inspection task regarding seats
over the wheelchair securement areas may deserve more attention.
The routes generating the largest numbers of Pass-Ups in 2017 include the #15 (East Colfax
Ave.), #0 (South Broadway), and #16 (West Colfax Ave.). The headways on these routes are
generally frequent—ten to fifteen minutes—so that a rider using a wheelchair who cannot be
accommodated on a particular trip does not have long to wait until the next bus arrives.

COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE POLICY
In addition to the Pass-Up data, the Securement Area Reports document complaints regarding
the Policy. These complaints have been handled as part of RTD’s customer service function,
which handles all complaints (as well as questions and comments) about RTD service, and
complaints related to the Policy were folded into this function.
Complaints coded as ADA are investigated by specific staff responsible for complaints for RTDoperated service and by staff responsible for complaints related to contractor-operator service.
The findings of the investigation for every ADA related (and Policy related) complaint are
detailed in monthly Customer Service Reports. The complaints related to the Policy are then
added to the Securement Area Report, as required by the Agreement. A new comprehensive
Complaint Procedure was put in place in November 2016 to ensure compliance with the ADA,
as discussed in our Second Annual Report.
Table 2 displays the complaints related to the Policy since the start of data collection required
by the Agreement and through the end of 2017. The number of complaints for 2017—six—is
significantly less than in the prior years.
We note that the number of Policy-related complaints is a very small number when compared
to total operator-related complaints in 2017—19,199 in 2017. But regardless of the fact that
complaints about the Policy may not be numerous, it is important to monitor all those related
to the Policy and take actions to address any trends shown.

Reasons for the remaining “Other” Pass-Ups were a mix of uncommon situations. For example,
one rider with a mobility device did not want to board the bus when the rider saw a guide dog
on-board. This rider apparently decided to wait for the next bus.

The Agreement required RTD to provide eight hours of ADA training for all new bus operators
as well as other operating staff and Customer Care Department staff. The Agreement also
required three hours of ADA refresher training annually for all bus operators and the other
identified staff.
We note that RTD’s bus operator training program has included training on the ADA for many
years prior to the Agreement.
With the Agreement in place, new materials were developed to cover the Policy and
accompanying procedures (e.g., use of the ADA Pass-Up Form) and incorporated into the new
operator training program. As discussed in our Initial ADA Expert Report, the ADA training for
new operators is more than 14 hours when both classroom and on-the-road instruction is
considered. The on-the-road ADA–related training includes, for example, use of the ramp and
lift, wheelchair securement, and use of the PA system when needed for stop/transfer
announcements.
RTD has also provided refresher training annually for bus operators prior to the Agreement.
The training program has covered a range of topics, including the ADA, with eight hours of
instruction. Once the Agreement was in place, this refresher training was revised to ensure that
it included the required three hours of training on the ADA and with at least 45 minutes on the
Policy and its accompanying procedures (e.g., the ADA Pass-Up Form).
RTD reports that the refresher training is now provided in two-hour sessions at four times over
the year. The transit agency has found that this training is more effective when provided in this
way rather than through one eight-hour session.
Training programs need to be assessed on a periodic basis to ensure they remain relevant and
cover what the trainees need to know. Bus operator training is no exception. Senior managers
in the Bus Operations Department specifically noted in our discussions that they monitor bus
operations and bus operator compliance with policies and procedures, including those related
to the Policy, on an on-going basis to watch for trends or issues that need attention. Training is
then modified as necessary to address any identified trends or issues, which includes operators’
efforts to provide access for riders with mobility devices to the securement areas.
The required refresher training, including the required instruction on the Policy, has been
completed for 2017. This includes the training for both RTD operators and operating staff as
well as the contractors’ operators and operating staff.
As noted in an earlier Annual Report, the ADA refresher training for the contractors’ operators
and other operating staff is provided through the contractors’ monthly safety meetings.

INPUT FROM RIDERS WITH DISABILITIES
Our on-site efforts in prior years included meeting with the Denver Regional Mobility & Access
Council's (DRMAC) Transit and Accessibility Task Force. This year we met instead with the
Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD), a committee first established last
year to address the range of issues relevant and important for riders with disabilities across all
modes with the exception of ADA paratransit (which has its own advisory committee). We also
met with a representative of CCDC, as we have done in past years.
Discussion topics and issues raised from the input are summarized below.

Use of Ramp
Discussion at the ACPD included comments about the use of a ramp vs. wheelchair lift for
riders using wheelchairs. An ACPD member said that using the ramp in some situations can be
very difficult—when the ramp is deployed to the street or other location lower than the curbed
sidewalk. The ACPD member noted that during the winter, snow sometimes prevents the bus
operator from using the normal bus stop and from deploying the ramp to the sidewalk at the
bus stop location. In such cases, the vehicle’s ramp may be deployed to an alley, driveway or
the bike path. When the ramp is deployed to that level, the ramp slope is steeper than when
deployed to the sidewalk. This may be unavoidable because of snow build-up, the ACPD
member noted, but in those situations, the ramp is quite steep for a rider with a wheelchair.
Bus operators should be attentive to these situations and, to the extent possible, identify a
location closely proximate to the bus stop so that the ramp might be deployed to a sidewalk or
at least to a portion of the street that is not sloping away from the bus. It is also important for
bus operators to fully kneel the bus, which helps decrease the ramp slope.1 Ramp deployment
in winter situations or when deployment is not possible at a curbed sidewalk should be
included in bus operator training, if it is not already addressed.

Wheelchair Access on Regional Buses
Another topic of discussion at the ACPD was wheelchair access to RTD’s regional buses. These
buses are over-the-road coaches with a wheelchair lift and two wheelchair securement areas.
According to the discussion, access from the lift to the securement area can be difficult for a
rider who uses a larger mobility device such as a scooter.

The refresher training for Customer Care Department staff, which is slightly modified so it is
more relevant and applicable for the Telephone Information Representatives and their duties,
has also been completed for 2017.

1.C.2.b

Figure 1: Wheelchair Securement Areas on Regional Bus
(RTD photo)

To facilitate access for riders with mobility devices such as wheelchairs and scooters, the bus
operator can maximize the space for the rider to maneuver into a securement area by
completely sliding up the two sets of seats in front of both securement areas and also flipping
up the seats on the set of seats behind the securement areas. This would give the rider more
room to safely move into the securement area.
If there is already a rider with a mobility device in one securement area when a second rider
with a mobility device boards, then providing this maximized space for the second rider is not
possible.
However, bus operators should be aware that they can give riders with mobility devices more
maneuvering space on the regional buses by completely moving forward the two sets of seats
on both sides of the bus, assuming that the rider boarding is the first to need access to the
securement area. But operator training for regional service should add this to the curriculum.

Access to each securement area is provided by sliding the two sets of seats in front of the
securement area completely forward and flipping up the seats on the set of seats behind the
securement area. See Figure 1.

1.C.2.b

Operator Training

A comment provided by the CCDC representative whom we met with prior to the ACPD
meeting brought up the topic of bus operator attitude and how that impacts the experience of
riders with disabilities including those traveling with mobility aids. A negative attitude or even
one that does not convey courtesy and acceptance of the rider can discourage riders with
disabilities from using accessible fixed route transit. And even if it does not discourage riders
with disabilities from using accessible fixed route, a negative or unwelcoming attitude is an
unpleasant experience that may stay with the rider.
One of the ADA regulations speaks to the need for transit operators and other staff to treat
individuals with respect and courtesy. Through 49 CFR §37.173 Training Requirements, ADA
regulations require that transit entities “shall ensure that personnel are trained to proficiency,
as appropriate to their duties… and properly assist and treat individuals with disabilities who use
the service in a respectful and courteous way [emphasis added], with appropriate attention to
the difference among individuals with disabilities.”
RTD should ensure that its training program for bus operators and other staff, as appropriate
for their position, addresses this requirement: bus operators and other staff should show
respect and provide courtesy to riders with disabilities when providing transit service, in
keeping with the ADA regulations regarding personnel training. An attitude that conveys
respect and courtesy encourages and supports riders with disabilities in using accessible fixed
route, when many of the riders may also be eligible for ADA paratransit. Use of fixed route
benefits the riders with more spontaneous travel options, and it is also less costly for the riders.
Use of accessible fixed route by riders with disabilities also benefits transit agencies as the
operating cost for fixed route trips is significantly less than for ADA paratransit trips.

Vehicles
Our last year’s report—the Second Annual ADA Expert Report—discussed the ordering and
deployment of the new 6300 series buses. Significantly, the planning for this bus procurement
included input from an ad-hoc group of people with disabilities, including CCDC
representatives. The input from this group was considered in the design of the wheelchair
securement areas, and RTD ordered 40 of the buses with the first of the vehicles placed into
revenue service last summer.

There was a general comment at the ACPD from a committee member about training for bus
operators—that “more was needed,” however no specifics were included.

The buses feature a new configuration for the securement areas, providing improved access for
riders using mobility devices and a re-designed Extra Space Area. See Figures 2 and 3. One
significant change is the staggered placement of the two wheelchair securement areas, which
specifically provides more room for a rider with a wheelchair to maneuver into the securement
areas. RTD has ordered another 60 of the 6300 series vehicles, with a delivery scheduled for
this calendar year.

Positive Comments Regarding 6300 Series Buses
Vehicle design impacts the usability of fixed route bus service for riders with disabilities
particularly those who travel with wheelchairs and other mobility aids. Positive comments
were made at the ACPD and by the CCDC representative about the 6300 series buses, for
example, that the buses provide more “options” for riders with mobility devices as there is more
space for riders with wheelchairs.
This was observed during one of our bus trips on route #15: a rider in a power wheelchair
positioned himself in the space provided when the two aisle-facing seats in front of the
curbside wheelchair securement area are flipped up. That area is not an official securement
area; it is specifically available to provide riders using wheelchairs more maneuvering space for

Figure 4: Rider with Power Wheelchair in

Space for Riders Using Walkers
An observation we made last year, as documented in the Second Annual ADA Expert Report, is
that the Extra Space Area in the 6300 series vehicles (see Figure 3) is too small for larger
walkers.
Space on the vehicles for riders with walkers was an issue also observed this year. Based on a
number of trips on route #15, half of which were served by a 6300 vehicle, we noted that riders
with walkers had some difficulty with seating. While some of the walkers could be folded,
riders tended not to do so. When seated in the front on priority aisle-facing seats, the walkers
obstruct the aisle for other riders. Only in one case—on a very crowded trip—did we observe a
rider who folded her walker.
The new 6300 vehicles improve access for riders who use wheelchairs yet the Extra Space
area—a space intended for riders with walkers as well as others traveling with larger items—is
not large enough for the larger walkers. In the next bus procurement cycle, RTD should
consider improved space for riders who travel with walkers.

Third Annual Report l KFH Group

access to the curbside securement area. The rider we observed on this trip positioned his
wheelchair in that space in front of the curbside securement area, which left the seats over the
securement area available for other priority riders. See Figure 4.

1.C.2.b

Another consideration for RTD when procuring new buses is inclusion of priority signage
directly on the seats over the wheelchair securement area. Such signage makes it very clear that
riders who sit in those seats may need to move and “Yield These Seats” to a rider using a
wheelchair. See Figure 5, showing the interior of a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority (SEPTA) bus with clear signage on the priority seats.
Such clear and explicit signage might help address situations that RTD bus operators
encounter—riders seated in seats over the securement area who refuse to move when asked to
do so by the operator to provide access to the securement area for a rider with a wheelchair.
Data from 2017 show that riders’ refusal to move from seats over the securement area caused
three Pass-Ups, and discussions with staff while we were on site for this Report noted several
recent complaints from riders who did not want to move from seats over the securement area.

Figure 5: Priority Signage Imprinted on Seats over Securement Area, SEPTA
Buses

The ADA regulations regarding access to the securement area require the bus operator to ask
riders sitting in the seats over the securement area to move when the area is needed by a rider
with a wheelchair, but the regulations specifically do not require the transit agency to enforce
that request. Signage directly on the seats over the securement would serve to directly inform
riders who sit there that they may be asked to move and might facilitate the bus operator’s job
when it is necessary to clear those seats for a rider needing access to the securement area.

Seating Over Wheelchair Securement Areas

1.C.2.b

Our role as the ADA Expert comes to a formal conclusion with this report, however we want to
strongly recommend that RTD continue certain activities implemented with the Agreement
that have been effective in improving fixed route bus service for riders with disabilities who use
mobility aids.
We also recommend RTD continue and consider several other actions to ensure effective bus
service for riders with disabilities who use mobility aids.

Continue Certain Requirements of the Settlement Agreement
The Agreement stipulated that its requirements begin on its Effective Date—the date when the
Agreement is fully executed by CCDC and RTD—and terminate three years thereafter, unless
otherwise specified. With an Effective Date of February 20, 2014, the three-year tem has ended.
We note that RTD has continued to follow requirements that were ongoing requirements
(certain requirements defined by the Agreement were one-time efforts, such as installing
specific signage on the buses) through the end of calendar 2017 and continues with those
requirements into 2018 as of the writing of this report.
We recommend that RTD continue to use the ADA Pass-Up Form and to produce the
Settlement Area Report, as discussed in more detail below. This recommendation is based on
our work over the past five years—which includes input from riders with disabilities, review
and assessment of the various reports, and discussions with RTD staff where managers credit
the Agreement requirements with reducing complaints from riders with disabilities. These
efforts have been effective in improving access for riders using mobility aids, including
wheelchairs, to the buses and to the securement areas. This is the intent of the Policy.
ADA Pass-Up Forms
Since late March 2014, RTD bus operators have followed very specific procedures as specified
in the Agreement when they are unable to provide boarding for a rider using a wheelchair or
other mobility aid at a bus stop.
The procedures include, among others, pressing the ADA PAX PASS-UP button on the invehicle mobile data terminal (MDT), filling out an ADA Pass-Up form and giving the first copy
of that form to the rider with a mobility device who cannot be accommodated. Figure 6 shows
the ADA Pass-Up Form used by bus operators, and Figure 7 diagrams the flow of the
procedures.
We suggest that RTD continue use of the ADA Pass-Up form by bus operators. This helps
ensure that bus operators maintain a focus on serving riders with disabilities, particularly those
who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids, and it will show that RTD is continuing its
commitment to provide effective bus service to riders with disabilities.

CONTINUING AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

As noted in discussions with RTD staff, the use of the forms and other efforts such as operator
training has focused operators’ attention on improving bus service for riders with disabilities,
resulting in fewer concerns and complaints by riders with disabilities. To terminate use of the
forms might suggest that providing effective bus service to riders with disabilities is no longer a
priority for the transit agency.
Also as noted in discussions with RTD staff, the Pass-Up Form procedures — while they require
extra time for the bus operator—are not a significant cause of bus service delays nor a frequent
concern from bus operators regarding their responsibilities.

The Agreement requires that RTD collect and document specified data for the ADA
Securement Area Report and report the data on an annual basis beginning in 2015 for the next
three years following the Effective Date of the Agreement. RTD has done that, with Securement
Area Reports for nine months of 2014, for calendar years 2015 and 2016, and with the most
recent Securement Area Report documenting ADA Pass-Ups and complaints about the Policy
for calendar year 2017. RTD staff is continuing to collect the same data for 2018.
We suggest that RTD continue to collect and capture the data elements for the Securement
Area Report. The focus should be on the data elements that are meaningful and useful in
monitoring bus operators’ compliance with the Policy. Appropriate RTD managers now
involved in and responsible for the data capture and reporting might discuss whether certain
data items are less or not important and might be options for elimination. What’s important is
that RTD continue to collect the relevant data allowing managers to properly monitor bus
service for riders with disabilities—particularly those traveling with mobility aids—and to then
take any needed remedial actions.
Our discussions with RTD staff firmly indicated that the process established by the
Agreement—whereby bus operators use the ADA Pass-Up Forms when they are unable to
board a rider using a wheelchair or other mobility aid and staff enter data about the Pass-Ups
into the Securement Area Reports—is working and therefore helping to meet the objective of
the Policy. Given this, we strongly support RTD in continuing the process or at least the most
relevant elements of the process that allows the transit agency to meet the Policy and provide
effective service for riders with disabilities who travel with a mobility aid.
ADA Training
ADA training for new operators should continue to include instruction on the Policy which
includes procedures for use of the ADA Pass-Up Form. We also recommend that the ADA
component of the Refresher Training be continued and that information on the Policy be
included as is the currently the case.
RTD has explained that its bus operator training materials are revised and changed as
appropriate—not only to add instruction on any new requirements or procedures but also to
address trends or issues that have arisen from monitoring efforts and that require attention.
This is good practice and helps ensure that bus operator training is effective and relevant.
Without ongoing attention to training sessions and materials, instruction can become stale and
less effective.
We note that the Agreement has required collaboration with CCDC on the training curriculum
for the ADA Training and ADA Refresher Training. We believe it is a good practice to include
the perspectives of riders with disabilities in bus operator training, whether this involves
collaboration in developing training materials, participation of selected individuals with
18

disabilities in actual hands-on training sessions as appropriate, or engaging riders with
disabilities to speak about what having accessible, reliable transportation means for them
(including riders who use wheelchairs speaking about how critical it is to have access to a
securement area). Inclusion can be done in various ways and with involvement of different
organizations in the disability community.
We recommend that RTD’s bus operator training continue to include the involvement of the
disability community in an appropriate and useful way. This will help ensure the training is
effective and sensitive to issues facing people with disabilities when they ride the bus.
Complaints Regarding the Policy
Complaints by riders with disabilities were an issue in our prior ADA Expert Reports: there had
been concerns expressed about ADA-related complaints at meetings of the Transit and
Accessibility Task Force that we attended and by the CCDC representative with whom we met.
We did not receive any feedback from riders with disabilities about the complaint process
during this year’s on-site work. As discussed earlier in this report, there were few complaints
related to the Policy in 2017.
We want to recognize RTD’s comprehensive complaint procedures, issued in November 2016,
titled The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Complaint Procedure Under The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). The document explains that the procedure may be used by anyone
who wishes to file a complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision
of services, activities, programs or benefits by RTD. Accordingly, it is "designed to provide
complainants the opportunity to quickly and effectively resolve any issue(s) as it relates to the
ADA and RTD."
RTD provides various avenues for riders including riders with disabilities to complain (e.g.,
through the RTD website, via telephone, and through an alternative format by contacting
RTD’s ADA manager). Complaints categorized as “ADA” receive special attention. Apparently,
a large number of complaints have been mis-categorized as ADA and new efforts are underway
to discern which complaints accurately relate to possible discriminatory actions so that RTD
can respond accordingly.

Other Recommendations
Consultation with Riders with Disabilities on New Bus Procurements
RTD should continue the practice of involving riders with disabilities including those using
mobility aids when planning new bus orders. The input from riders with disabilities during
planning efforts that resulted in procurement of the 6300 series buses was significant in
suggesting improvements to the securement area design. RTD used an ad-hoc group of riders

1.C.2.b

Importantly, the riders to be involved should be a mix of riders with disabilities (ambulatory
and not ambulatory) and using different mobility aids (e.g., wheelchair, walker, cane). They
should also be active riders of accessible fixed route with experience and insights to share.
Inclusion of riders with disabilities in planning for new bus procurements is among the ways to
demonstrate a commitment to effective service for riders with disabilities, and perhaps more
importantly it is a way to get real-life feedback from those who use the service that could make
significant improvements for their use.
Bus Operator Training
Bus operators serve a central role in providing effective transit service to all riders including
riders with disabilities. Discussions with riders with disabilities to prepare this Annual Report
provide several suggestions that RTD should include to enhance and strengthen bus operator
training:


Bus operator training should specifically include the need to treat riders with disabilities
with respect and courtesy. Transit personnel are to be trained to “proficiency as
appropriate to their duties” as required under 49 CFR §37.173 Training Requirements.



Training for operating the regional service that uses the lift-equipped over-the-road
coaches should include information to facilitate access to the securement area for riders
using wheelchairs and scooters. Specifically, the bus operator can maximize the space
for the rider to maneuver into a securement area by completely sliding up the two sets
of seats in front of both securement areas and also flipping up the seats on the set of
seats behind the securement areas. This would give the rider more room to safely move
into the securement area.



Training should include attention to the kneeling feature of buses and particularly the
importance of fully kneeling the bus so that the ramp slope is as low as possible, making
it safer for a rider using a wheelchair to board. This is a particular issue when the
operator cannot serve the regular bus stop because of obstruction from snow or some
other obstacle. In such case, the bus operator may need to deploy the ramp to the street
or bike lane and the ramp slope will be steeper. Fully kneeling the bus may make that
slope somewhat less steep.



A review of the ADA Pass-Ups in 2017 found more than a few that occurred because the
operator could not raise the seats over the securement area. RTD reports the bus
operators’ pre-trip inspection includes a check of the seats——for the 40-foot and 60foot buses as well as the over-the-road coaches—to ensure that the wheelchair
securement areas are fully available for riders with mobility aids. RTD should ensure

with disabilities during the planning that preceded the 6300 series order. In the future, the
ACPD might be an appropriate committee to provide input.

1.C.2.b

SUMMARY
Our review and assessment of RTD’s efforts in implementing the Agreement requirements,
input we have received from riders with disabilities, as well as other efforts such as involving
riders with disabilities when planning the order of new buses, demonstrate that RTD has
improved fixed route bus service for riders with mobility aids and specifically improvements in
ensuring access to the securement areas.
According to a comment from a member of ACPD at the August 2018 meeting, the majority of
RTD’s bus operators “do just fine” in serving riders with disabilities. Our discussions with riders
with disabilities indicate that access to the securement areas has improved considerably since
2014. In particular, comments from riders with disabilities indicate that efforts in
implementing the Policy have noticeably reduced conflicts with strollers, which had been a
significant problem for riders with disabilities traveling with a mobility aid. This is not to say
that the issue of strollers has disappeared—there continue to be incidents where a rider refuses
to collapse the stroller, though these are isolated according to the Securement Area Reports.
There are also incidents where ambulatory riders seated in seats over the securement area
refuse to move after being asked to do so by the bus operator. Again, these are isolated
incidents according to the data.
The ability to monitor such incidents impacting access to the securement areas and to assess
progress comes directly from the data collection required by the Agreement—the ADA PassUps forms, the Securement Area Issues Reports, and documentation of complaints regarding
the Policy. This speaks to the value of continuing these efforts. This will allow RTD to continue
monitoring trends and then take any needed corrective actions.
Continuing the data collection activities also demonstrates a continued commitment on the
part of RTD to ensuring effective service for riders with disabilities including those who use
mobility aids.
We trust RTD will build on its efforts since 2014 into future years to provide effective fixed
route bus service for riders with disabilities and to ensure access to the wheelchair securement
areas for those riders who travel with a mobility aid including wheelchairs. We also hope our
role as the ADA Expert in reviewing, assessing and documenting RTD’s implementation of the
Agreement and related efforts towards improving bus service for riders with disabilities have
supported RTD’s efforts.

The Policy: Boarding Individuals with Disabilities
Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access

Packet Pg. 44

1.C.2.c

EXHIBIT A
Boarding Individuals with Disabilities who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access Policy

RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including Wheelchairs, have equal access
to its buses and to the Securement Areas. This policy is effective on March 24, 2014.
2. Definitions
Individual with a Disability means an individual with a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of that individual and any individual
who identifies to a bus operator that the individual has a disability.
Mobility Aid means a device, such as a Wheelchair, scooter or walker, used by an Individual
with a Disability for the purpose of mobility, not just for convenience only.
Priority Seating means the first row of seating that is not the Securement Area or Securement
Areas.
Securement Area or Securement Areas means one or both of the areas required on a fixed route
bus for the purpose of securing a Wheelchair.
Wheelchair means a Mobility Aid belonging to any class of three- or more-wheeled devices,
usable indoors, designed or modified for and used by individuals with mobility impairments,
whether operated manually or powered.
3. Good Customer Service
All passengers with or without disabilities are to be treated with the highest degree of respect and
concern for safety. Passengers using Wheelchairs or other Mobility Aids may be particularly
vulnerable if left stranded at a bus stop. They do not want to wait for the next available bus any
more than other passengers. Therefore, if you are unable to accommodate a passenger using a
Wheelchair or other Mobility Aid for any reason, you are required to report the situation to the
dispatcher and remain there until cleared to proceed.
4. Boarding Strollers and Other Large Items
Articles, baggage or packages are not permitted on buses if they are dangerous or restrict free
movement of passengers. Articles permitted on the bus must not interfere with the vehicle
operation or any other passenger. Grocery carts must be folded or positioned so that they do not
block the aisle of the bus. Whatever a passenger brings on the bus must be readily movable. When
a passenger with a stroller boards the bus, require the passenger to collapse the stroller prior to
boarding. Passengers will not be allowed to board with large strollers or other items that cannot be
collapsed and/or stored in the seats behind the Securement Areas and Priority Seating.
You must advise the passenger upon boarding to use seats behind the Securement Areas and
Priority Seating for themselves and their objects because if they do sit in the Securement Area, they
will be required to move if needed by an Individual with a Disability using a Mobility Aid. Do not
permit a passenger to fold up the seat to make room for items brought on board the bus, other than
a Mobility Aid.

1. Purpose

1.C.2.c

5. Boarding an Individual with a Disability who uses a Mobility Aid

(1) Do not assume or state that the bus is too crowded to board a passenger with a
Mobility Aid.
(2) Get up and look first to see if other passengers are blocking the Securement Area or
access to the Securement Area. Disabled passengers using Mobility Aids must have
access to the Securement Area, because these are the only places they can sit and
therefore have equal access to the bus.
(3) If a passenger is utilizing a Securement Area, get up from the driver seat, approach the
individual occupying the Securement Area and say, “I need to use this area to allow a
passenger with a disability to board please. You will need to move to a seat behind the
Securement Area.” This applies to any person regardless of what equipment or items
the individual has brought on the bus, expect Mobility Aids. Request that Individuals
with a Disability not using a Mobility Aid or using a Mobility Aid that does not require
securement to move from the Securement Area. Offer to assist in finding a seat, if
necessary.
(4) When you are at a bus stop with both able-bodied passengers and passengers using
Mobility Aids, you must clear the Securement Area to accommodate the boarding
passenger using a Mobility Aid. It is not acceptable to allow the able-bodied
passengers to board first, leaving insufficient space for the Individual with a Disability
with a Mobility Aid. You should attempt to board Individuals with a Mobility Aid
prior to boarding others waiting at the bus stop to ensure access to the Securement
Areas.
(5) Once sufficient space is made available to board the passenger, deploy the lift (if
applicable), board the passenger, and then continue on the route.
(6) Never blame the passenger who uses a Mobility Aid for delays, inconveniences or
imply the passenger is holding up the bus. Keep your interactions polite and
respectful.
(7) Unless the person occupying the Securement Areas is an Individual with a Disability
who, for some disability-related reason needs to remain in the Securement Area, the
person who is unwilling to move is in violation of RTD policies and is preventing the
Individual with a Disability who uses a Mobility Aid from accessing the only seats
available. You may not ask about disability, but the person may divulge. If the person
offers a disability-related reason for being in the Securement Area or the reason is
apparent, do not inquire further. If the Individual with a Disability does not use a
Mobility Aid, ask the person to move to the Priority Seating. If the person does not
offer a disability-related reason for being in the Securement Area and the reason is not
apparent, see Section 6.

In order to ensure an Individual with a Disability who uses a Mobility Aid will have access to the
bus when the Securement Areas are occupied, RTD operators will take the following steps:

1.C.2.c

6. When an Individual in the Wheelchair Securement Area Does Not Move
If an individual in the Securement Area does not move, RTD operators shall do the following:

(2) Inform the passengers on the bus that the operator is required to contact the dispatcher
to get further instructions because the individual in the Securement Area refuses to
move. Do not leave the bus stop until cleared to do so by the dispatcher or supervisor.
(3) Contact the dispatcher. On equipped buses, use the preprogrammed radio data
message, “ADA PAX PASS-UP”. This places your request for assistance to a high
priority level. That means that your call will be handled ahead of other routine calls.
(4) If you are unable to use the ADA PAX PASS-UP message, you must attempt to
contact dispatch by other methods available and obtain instructions from a supervisor
or dispatcher before leaving the stop.
(5) The dispatcher will provide you with information on how the passenger will be
accommodated. If practicable, RTD will send a street supervisor or security officer to
the bus to talk to the passenger. If warranted, the street supervisor or security officer
may issue a warning for suspension of service or take other appropriate action.
(6) You must relay whatever action will be taken to the waiting passenger with a disability
as soon as possible. Dispatch will instruct the bus operator of the alternative
transportation, if applicable under Section 8 below, or offer a courtesy transfer.
(7) You must provide a completed ADA PAX PASS-UP form to the waiting passenger
with a disability. You must provide the information in writing and offer to read such
information to the waiting passenger with a disability.
Only after following these steps are you to proceed.
7. When the Securement Areas are Occupied by Individuals with Disabilities who use
Mobility Aids
If both the Securement Areas are occupied by Individuals with Disabilities who use Mobility Aids,
the following shall apply:
(1) The operator must inform the waiting passenger of this condition.
(2) An operator may only inform the waiting passenger that the Securement Areas are full
or occupied by Individuals with Disabilities who use Mobility Aids if it is absolutely
clear that the passengers occupying the Securement Areas are, in fact, Individuals with
Disabilities who use Mobility Aids, e.g., both passengers use Wheelchairs. If there is
any doubt as to whether the persons occupying the Securement Areas are Individuals
with Disabilities who use Mobility Aids, the operator must follow all of the steps in
Section 6.
(3) The operator shall provide the waiting passenger with the ADA PAX PASS-UP form
as required in Section 6, shall offer the waiting passenger a courtesy transfer and use

the preprogrammed data message, “ADA PAX PASS-UP” or, if that message system is
unavailable, contact dispatch to notify RTD that in Individual with a Disability who
uses a Mobility Aid did not board the bus because the Securement Areas were
occupied. The dispatcher will provide instructions on alternative transportation.

When an Individual with a Disability using a Mobility Aid is refused service because RTD informs
the waiting passenger the Securement Areas are occupied and the next bus is not scheduled to
arrive for 30 minutes or more, RTD will provide the rider with alternative transportation to ensure
the passenger reaches the intended destination in a timely fashion.

Call-n-Ride Renaming

INFORMATION
Call-n-Ride service renaming.
BACKGROUND
In March, 2000, RTD added a new service, “Call-n-Ride,” to its family of services. Call-n-Ride has 21
service areas and utilizes 40 vehicles during the peak hours, accommodating approximately 1,900
average weekday boardings. Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, Call-n-Ride can be
defined as, “shared-ride, demand responsive public transportation provided in a defined geographic
territory where customers typically arrange for pick-up/drop off and pay a local bus fare.” Call-n-Ride
service areas are usually located in a low density suburban area where bus service is not feasible.
The service uses a small vehicle that seats up to 14 passengers. The vehicle can accommodate 2
passengers in mobility devices and 2 bicycles. Customers can book trips with 60 minutes to 30 days
advance notice and also book recurring trips (subscriptions). Service is available on a first come, first
served basis. Trips are grouped for shared-riding to be productive and cost-effective. It is not a taxi-type
service.
Over the years Call-n-Ride service has been customized to suit each service area to include some of the
following features: 1) timed connections at BRT or rail stations where customers transfer to Call-n-Ride
without booking a pickup; 2) flex routes where customers can board at scheduled checkpoints without
booking a reservation; and 3) establishing common pick-up/drop-off locations (checkpoints) within
service area zones (for example, a school, an apartment complex or mobile home park). In 2010, RTD
introduced MobilityDR software to provide for completely automated scheduling, which allowed
customer trip booking via the Internet.
DISCUSSION
Call-n-Ride has evolved over the years to a service where over 60% of the trips are not booked in
advance (passengers simply board buses waiting at light rail stations or along “flex routes”), and a
majority of passengers book online rather than “calling” for services. Consequently, the name “Call-nRide” does not fit the way service is provided today. Working with RTD’s Marketing and Market
Research Divisions, staff sought to develop a new name more reflective of the current service through
the assistance of the RTD Online Customer Panel. The Panel, comprised of 400 individuals who frequent
RTD buses and trains, was asked to identify service attributes most important to customers.
Based on Panel feedback, the name FlexRide was developed and selected to reflect the fluid, flexible,
and contemporary nature of the service as it now stands. In contrast to a fixed route, FlexRide is a
service that is designed with each community’s specific needs in mind—whether for first mile/last mile
or community-circulation or both. New features currently in development will include trip booking on a
smartphone app and reducing the advance reservation time from 60 minutes to only 10 minutes.

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.3

To correspond with the new name, enhancements to booking services, and with a strategic agency-wide
brand refresh, geared to strengthen, consolidate, and modernize the existing agency brand identity, 32
new FlexRide vehicles will debut with the January 13 service change. These vehicles feature an updated
RTD logo presentation, a more stylized and current “mountain” symbol reminiscent of the mountains
currently on our fixed fleet, and top trim in the corporate RTD agency red. They also feature a descriptor
“Your neighborhood connection” at the top of the vehicle to more fully illustrate that FlexRide serves as
a vital community-based link to destinations, in first mile/last mile scenarios, and as a connector to other
modes of transit (e.g., rail). This descriptor language also evolved from the Customer Panel feedback.
The remaining 22 green vehicles will have naming logos changed to reflect the new service. As these
vehicles are replaced over the next couple of years, their look will be refreshed on the new buses to the
updated brand look. Schedules, shelterboards, and other key informational materials will be migrated to
this updated look across the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The expenses associated with changing the name of the service from “Call-n-Ride” to “FlexRide,”
including new bus signage, updating print media and electronic references, and the additional marketing
efforts to communicate this change, will be covered as part of the normal service change process and
the vehicle procurement. The 32 vehicles being replaced this year are being replaced under their normal
replacement cycle.

Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation
Agency Safety Plan

Safety,

Board Meeting Date: November 13, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
Under new Federal Transit Administration (FTA) rulemaking, RTD is required to transition from an
Agency System Safety Program Plan to a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) using the
Safety Management System (SMS) Framework by July 28, 2020. However, the new FTA rule on State
Safety Oversight (SSO) became effective in August 2018. The new SSO rulemaking requires that the
PTASP be signed by the Accountable Executive, the General Manager and CEO, and approved by the
Board of Directors annually.
DISCUSSION
The FTA created a new State Safety Oversight regulation 49 CFR Part 674 in 2016 and the Colorado
PUC was certified in April of 2018 making the new ruling effective in August 2018. The new regulation
replaced State Safety Oversight/System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) regulation 49 CFR 659 which
required transit agency’s to develop a System Safety Program Plan. The new regulation requires Rail
Transit Agencies to develop a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) based on a Safety
Management System (SMS) framework that is signed by the Agency Accountable Executive (General
Manager and CEO) approved by the Board of Directors and submitted to the State Safety Oversight
Agency for certification annually.
However, the FTA only recently (July 2018) released the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
regulation 49 CFR Part 673 which requires agencies to develop and be compliant with a PUC approved
PTASP by July 20, 2020. As a result of the mismatched timing of the regulations, we are in a
transitional period, still technically under Part 659 SSPP as an Agency, but also technically beholden to
the new Part 674 regulation. Therefore, we are submitting an initial PTASP in the SMS Framework that
is a bridge document that includes all certified SSPP elements plus some additional SMS elements. We
are asking for your review of this PTASP bridge document submission, understanding that it will meet all
requirements for the current 49 CFR Part 659 SSPP requirements and the current PUC 49 CFR Part 674
Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan transition requirements. We will be submitting a more finished
PTASP for your approval in the 4th quarter of 2019 for what we plan to be a more complete SMS

I POLICY
Pillar I of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Policy. This is at its most simple, the
safety policy developed, approved and signed by the district. However, this pillar also describes RTD’s
commitment to safety, its objectives and safety goals and the organizational structure established and
plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
RTD was created on March 2, 1969 by the Colorado Legislature. RTD is multimodal agency comprised
of light rail, commuter rail, bus, and special services.RTD's mission is to strengthen and connect
communities, enabling individuals to pursue a fuller life with greater ease and convenience by leading in
partnering, planning, and wise investment of physical, economic, and human resources. In accordance
with the directives of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, (MAP-21) and Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, RTD undertook the conversion of the Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan (SSPP) into the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)
in 2018. The PTASP consists of a series of policies and procedures, which must be undertaken to ensure
the safety of its customers, employees, emergency responders, and the general public. Development of the
PTASP was completed in accordance with Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 53,
Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and
Standards 49 CFR Part 674; Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) and Federal Railroad
Administration rules and regulations (FRA). The PTASP is the system-wide governing safety document
for all transit modes operated by RTD.
The RTD PTASP has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety
throughout the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four pillar foundations as
described in the following table.
SMS Component
Safety Policies and Procedures
Safety Risk Management
Safety Assurance

Safety Promotion

Description
Definition of safety policies, procedures and
organizational structure
Formal process for management of hazards to
an acceptable level of risk
Establishment of process measures, assessments
and controls to assess the effectiveness of risk
control strategies
Safety training and risk communication practices to
promote a culture of safety

Described throughout the PTASP are: RTD’s safety policies and procedures; safety risk management in
the form of RTD’s hazard management program; safety assurance mainly accomplished through RTD’s
internal safety review program; and training and practices to support safety promotion.

Authority

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a special transportation district of the State of Colorado
and authorized under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the District has its own
taxing power and operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver,
Douglas, and Jefferson. The District is managed by a fifteen member elected Board of Directors who have
authorized the RTD General Manager to develop and implement a comprehensive and integrated Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan. To that end, the General Manager, by signature authority of the
District’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General
Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management to develop and implement a Public Transportation
Agency Safety Plan as an operating document of the District for all modes of operations including
commuter rail, light rail, and bus/paratransit. RTD’s contractors, including RTD’s commuter rail operator
– Denver Transit Partners - are also governed under this Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
In April 2005, the U.S. Congress expanded the FTA regulatory role by granting authority to develop state
safety oversight programs, as defined by 49 CFR 659 - Final Rule, Rail Fixed Guideway Systems; State
Safety Oversight.
The FTA recognizes Colorado PUC, as the state safety oversight agency for RTD. PUC-SSO is FTA's
certified safety oversight agency, working cooperatively to regulate RTD's light rail transit, by ensuring
compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance, as applicable.
The FTA functions as both an administrator of funds for capital projects and as a federal regulator as
defined by 49 CFR 659, 670 and 673. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the state safety oversight
agency (PUC- SSOA), to determine the SSO's and RTD's compliance to the FTA's general requirements.
RTD's light rail service is regulated by the FTA, and PUC SSO agencies.
RTD's commuter rail service is fully regulated by the FRA, and is not regulated by the PUC- SSO
(excepting at-grade crossings), or the FTA.

I 1.3

Policy Statement

Safety is a core value at the Regional Transportation District (RTD). RTD is committed to a positive
safety culture and creating a workplace that is safe, healthy, and injury free. Our employees are our most
valuable assets and their safety and health is critical. This policy statement applies to all personnel and
every aspect of the company’s activities. A positive safety culture includes ownership by all employees,
effort to identify and correct deficiencies at all levels, personal accountability and effective
communications.
RTD is committed to:
 Integrating safety management among the primary responsibilities of all managers and employees
 Clearly defining accountabilities and responsibilities for the delivery of RTD’s Safety
Management System performance for all levels of staff
 Supporting safety management with appropriate resources
 Developing an organizational culture that fosters safe practices, and encourages effective
employee safety reporting and communication
 Enhancing hazard identification and analysis, and safety risk evaluation activities, including an
employee safety reporting program, to eliminate or mitigate the safety risks resulting from all
activities to an acceptable level of safety (ALARP)
 Complying with federal, state, and RTD safety-related requirements, rules, and standards

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment and
training
Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets
Continually improving our safety performance through management processes that ensure
appropriate actions are taken and assuring effectiveness
Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet RTD’s safety performance standards.

RTD utilizes a Safety Management System (SMS) to prevent accidents, to reduce risk of injury and
minimize damage to property and equipment. We will work proactively towards identifying and reducing
the existence of hazards and risks in the workplace and in our system.
As the Accountable Executive for all operations and activities I will ensure that resources are available to
ensure our SMS is robust and successful. RTD management will take steps to prevent workplace
incidents, injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. They will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards, and regularly review the company safety programs.
RTD supervisors are responsible for supervising and training workers in safe work practices. They are
expected to enforce company safety rules and work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Supervisors will
lead safety efforts by example.
All RTD employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities including reporting
hazards, reporting unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a
safety committee/department representative. All employees will wear required personal protective
equipment (PPE) and participate in and support safety activities. Employees will serve as Safety
Ambassadors by working safely, complying with requirements and serving as an example to others.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports
any accident, incident, concern or hazard. All employees are required to abide by the standards and
procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Elements such as illegal activity, negligence, acts
of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the Chief Safety and Security Officer who reports
directly to me. All levels of management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest
level of safety performance, starting with the General Manager and CEO.

Goals and Objectives

The RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) establishes formal structure and
processes to be used by RTD to identify, assess, track, control, minimize, and resolve hazards
associated with RTD bus and rail systems. The PTASP will be used as a means of preventing
injuries, incidents, system disruption, accidents, environmental damage, and other losses. It
demonstrates RTD's commitment to safety and compliance through loss prevention programs.
The plan is consistent with federal, state, and local regulations, and it sets forth procedures to
comply with standards and conditions of industry, 49 CFR Part 674, PUC's SSO Program
Standards, and applicable FRA rules and regulations applicable to Commuter Rail as contained in
49 CFR.
The PTASP applies to the planning, design, procurement, construction, activation, operations,
and maintenance services of the bus and rail system. The PTASP is approved by the General
Manager /CEO and implemented under the direction of the Chief Safety and Security Officer and
Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC). RTD embraces and participates with the
Colorado Department of Transportation in achieving the state wide goal of “Zero Fatalities”
program. “This is a goal that everyone can live with”.
RTD's annual objectives are:
 Zero Fatalities in RTD operating systems; Bus, Light Rail and Commuter Rail
 Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
 Bus less than 2.0
 Light Rail less than 2.0
 Commuter Rail less than 2.0
 Lost time employee injuries less than 1.0 per 100 employees
 10% reduction of OJI’s
 Eliminate or mitigate Serious and High Hazards
 Close maximum number of identified hazards
The overall consideration in the development of the RTD PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of passengers throughout the transit system. The passengers and the general public
must be confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this it is necessary to
design, construct and maintain a system that is free from recognized hazards with the safety of
passengers and the general public in mind. RTD’s objectives will be met by drawing information
from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific RTD
requirements into a unified document to ensure a safe transportation system.

Integrating Safety into all Aspects of RTD

The objective of safety at RTD is the continual improvement of our processes and operations to
maximize safety to the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual
opportunities for employees to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their
operations, and multiple means for each employee to identify potential hazards.
We accomplish this through Safety Moments at RTD meetings, Safety committee meetings,
weekly Safety messages, safety poster campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards,
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within the different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety are presented. As

Management—Key Role in Safety Overview

RTD's safety program is incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service
managers. Safe operations of bus and rail units are the responsibility of the Assistant General
Manager (AGM). Each operating division has an appointed AGM, who along with managers and
supervisors are responsible for implementing policies and procedures for safe operations. The
assistant general managers of the rail and bus units have charged their management teams to
effectively manage safety, and to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training, policies,
and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance
facilities are staffed with a manager of maintenance responsible for the safe operation of the
facility, and are supported by shift supervisors and maintenance workers during their performing
maintenance, servicing, and inspection.
Supervisors' responsibilities place them at the forefront of RTD's rail and bus services safety
efforts. A significant portion of their duty is to serve as frontline safety officers; monitoring,
ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance, rules compliance, and promoting a strong safety
climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are RTD's key to
improved safety-related behavior, and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the
responsibility to monitor safety compliance of their employees and ascertain that employees
understand their job functions and the safety requirements of that job.
RTD safety compliance is managed at the lowest levels. Each employee is trained in safety, job
duties, and given responsibility for their own safety and the safety with whom he/she works. All
employees have the authority to halt an operation if it is deemed to be unsafe. RTD's system
safety processes emphasize open and fair dialog between leaders and subordinates to increase the
commitment to safety at all levels.
In an oversight role, safety compliance officers report to the manager of safety who reports to the
chief safety officer. Safety compliance officers have a role in executing the functions necessary to
ensure safety, to include the following:









Coordinate safety activities of the agency.
Compile safety data and perform analysis to identify and assess operational risk.
Assist in the investigation of accidents and incidents as appropriate.
Evaluate hazard resolutions proposed by departments.
Perform analysis to identify and resolve hazards.
Evaluate proposed system modifications from a safety perspective.
Conduct safety reviews and inspections.
Provide safety support such as field and laboratory testing.

1.C.4.b

The Safety Department will conduct regularly scheduled internal safety reviews to evaluate
compliance and conformance with RTD's PTASP, PUC-SSO Program Standards 49 CFR Part
674; and 49 CFR 673. Safety compliance officers serve as alternates to each other. Safety
compliance officers work closely with management and employees, through various processes
and committees, and have authority to determine compliance. When warranted, safety compliance
officers may issue corrective action plans (CAP), and ensure appropriate departments implement
those plans. Safety compliance officers are the designated contacts to regulatory agencies, and
serve as alternate contacts to the PUC-SSO oversight agency.

Climate / Geography

The Denver Metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined
seasons. Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not
oppressive since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the
hottest month with temperatures reading 90– 100 degrees F. Winters are cold, but usually not
severe. The average annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at the Denver airport but much higher
amounts fall in foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall
but may be heavy in the spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean are moving through the area
more frequently than at any other season of the year.
The RTD transit services extend throughout the Front Range Area approximately 60 miles wide
(E-W) between Pine Junction, Denver and Denver International Airport. The area also ranges
from Longmont on the north to Lone Tree on the South, a distance of 70 Miles. Service areas
include the foothills situated along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range
from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater than 9000 feet above sea level in the
foothills.

I 5 TRANSIT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
I 5.1

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit
system. In 1989, the Colorado Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional
Transportation District was eligible to collect a Use Tax that enabled the District to accumulate
funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991 and
construction on the initial 5.3 mile rail system and a functional maintenance facility began
without Federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October of 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of
September, 1994 and the system opened for revenue service with eleven light rail vehicles on
October 7, 1994.

I 5.1.1 Scope and Service
Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak (AM
and PM commuter times) and off-peak hours, weekends and weekdays, and special events, such
as conventions, sports, and parades. Light rail transit carries over 60,000 riders daily. Trains
operate as one, two, three, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the Light Rail Transit System
safely, reliably and efficiently and to integrate the light rail’s operation with bus service for the
greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the integration of transportation
services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion, and
improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3 mile Central Corridor, the 8.7 mile Southwest
Corridor the 1.8 mile Central Platte Valley Spur, the 19 mile Southeast Corridor, and the 12.1
mile West Rail Line, and the 10.5 mile I-225 corridor. The system accommodates six lines; C, D,
E, F, H, L, W and R.

I 5.1.2 Organizational Structure
The Light Rail Safety Compliance Officer’s office is located at the Light Rail Operations center.
Thus, the lines of communication between System Safety and Light Rail Operations are effective.
Key positions with Light Rail Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,

Packet Pg. 94

General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, Manager of Light Rail Transportation,
General Superintendent of Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Manager of Light Rail Maintenance
of Way, General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance, and Manager of Light Rail
Vehicle Maintenance. All of these key positions have daily contact with the Light Rail Safety
Compliance Officer.

I 5.1.3 Light Rail Corridors
Central Corridor
Central Corridor transit service is supported by a maintenance facility, light rail vehicles, 15
passenger stations, administrative offices, warehousing, traction power substations, and exclusive
and public rights-of-way through service areas. The light rail maintenance facility is located in
Denver at 655 Mariposa Street near 6th Avenue. Light rail operates at high speed along an
exclusive right-of-way section adjacent to freight rail from the south, through the central or
downtown section at reduced speed, and continues at reduced speed through a
business/residential area to the north. The Central Corridor operates on 5.3 miles of trackway
with 15 stations including 5 park-n-ride locations. Light rail operates at surface level except for
one fly-over structure near Kalamath. There are two controlled high speed grade crossings along
the Central Corridor alignment, one at 13th Avenue and one at Bayaud.
The Central Corridor extends from I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end to 30th Avenue and
Downing Street on the north. Operations through downtown Denver is a contra-flow relative to
normal traffic, with trains heading northeasterly on California and southwesterly on Stout. The
Central Corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer
facility, Broadway Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th
Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center Transit Stations, and Union Station, Five Points, and
many major hotels and businesses in between).
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th
Street Mall shuttles include the Denver Center for the Performing Arts Complex, Federal
Courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center, State Capitol, Denver Art
Museum, Denver Public Library, Colorado History Museum, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Exhibit I shows the alignment of the Central Corridor and the locations of the fifteen passenger
stations which it serves.
The majority of the Central Corridor alignment is double tracked and parallels I-25 to the east on
an existing railroad right-of-way purchased by RTD from the D&RGW Railroad. The southern
terminus is at the I-25/Broadway Transfer Station where the alignment proceeds adjacent to the
freight rail corridor down to the Colfax viaduct and Auraria campus. From the Auraria campus on
through the Central Business District area and out to the northern terminus, the trackway is part
of the Denver public streets. The I- 25/Broadway southern terminus station serves as a major bus
transfer facility for Express, Regional and local buses previously destined to the Denver Central
Business District.
Approximately ½ mile north from the south end of the alignment and I-25/Broadway, another bus
transfer facility and passenger station is located at the Broadway Marketplace at Alameda.
Further north, the alignment is grade separated from Santa Fe and Kalamath by an elevated
structure. There are two high-speed grade crossings, one at Bayaud and one at 13th Avenue. Each
crossing is protected by a street median, flashing lights, gates and warning bells. Flashing lights

1.C.4.b

Continuing north, the Colfax at Auraria passenger station near the Auraria Campus allows direct
access to the campus via a plaza as well as a bus transfer point. After leaving the Colfax at
Auraria station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath and Speer Boulevard,
across a structure over Cherry Creek along Stout to the Convention Center Station near 14th
Street and Stout. At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along
California. The outbound track continues on Stout Street between 14th and 19th Streets. There are
two passenger stations located on Stout at 16th and 18th Streets. The inbound track along
California travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction across 15th Street to the 16th
Street and California passenger station located on the bus mall. Continuing on the single northeast
bound track the alignment then crosses 17th Street to the next passenger station at 18th
Street on California. The single track proceeds northerly along California and southerly along
Stout and lying between 14th and 19th Streets and is referred to as the Crossmall. The Crossmall
is a loop formed by the single-track along the streets of California, 19th, Stout, and 14th, and
provides contra-flow in normally counterclockwise movements.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th where it joins the westbound track to Welton and where
the double track now travels east on Welton Street to the 20th Street passenger station located
between 19th and 20th on Welton. The double track alignment continues as it crosses over to the
south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th and 25th the double track
configuration transitions into a single track configuration. The single-track alignment is retained
as it continues northeasterly on Welton and next proceeds to the 25th Street passenger station
located at the nearside of 26th Street. Still traveling northeasterly along the alignment, the LRV
approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th Streets, the alignment then
enters the 29th Street passenger station located on the far side of 29th Street. Following this
station between 29th and 30th the single tracked configuration transitions into a double track
configuration as it enters the 30th Avenue/Downing northern terminus station.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize Automated Fare Equipment for ticket sales and ticket
validation. Fare Inspectors monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving Rail Supervisors,
contracted security specialists, and local police departments provide platform security.
An initial fleet of eleven light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the operation of Central
Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. The LRVs are a
Siemens Duewag SD100 model. They are 6-axle, single articulated, double ended, bi-directional,
high floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches in width, 13 feet
high and operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
from an overhead wire by 750 volts direct current and capable of speeds up to 55 MPH. Each
vehicle is able to seat 64 passengers and will accommodate up to an additional 61 standing
passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be accommodated at a crush load capacity.
Exhibit II shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize the level of
comfort with which the passenger is afforded for their trip. In addition, the LRV is equipped with
air conditioning and good lighting configuration.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio
communication, operational procedures and train orders govern operators regarding all
movements of the vehicles. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit signage and wayside

and warning bells protects the 6th Street crossing near Auraria. Another passenger station is
located at 10th and Osage. The station is primarily accessed as a pedestrian and kiss-and ride.

signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossing are protected by coordinating adjacent street intersection
traffic signals while the at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by a gate
crossing with flashers and warning bells. The crossing at 6th Street is protected with flashing
lights and warning bells. The crossing at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and
maintained by the Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.
A 2.5 acre yard and Light Rail Operations Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific
Railroad switching yard near 6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the
double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads at either end of the storage yard,
allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Operations Facility includes a
yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support
maintenance. Central Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational
governing authority for all mainline vehicle movement. Central Control personnel
(Controller/Supervisors) direct, control and monitor revenue-service operations using radio,
telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations is controlled by a schedule
timetable and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules,
rules and procedures. Controllers implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service
schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment failures, emergency situations, or
weather related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance and non- revenue
maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shop.
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail System began October 7, 1994. The system
is operated by Denver’s Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit
system which includes local bus routes, express bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes,
and demand-response service for disabled customers.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July of 2000. It is an 8.7 mile extension of
the existing light rail system. Integrating into the existing system at I-25 and Broadway in
Denver, the Southwest Corridor extends south to Mineral Avenue in Littleton. There are five light
rail stations at the following locations: Evans Avenue Station; Englewood Station near Hampden
Avenue; Oxford Avenue Station; Littleton Station (downtown Littleton); and Mineral Avenue
Station. Each station location has an associated Park-n-Ride with the exception of the Oxford
Station. Refer to Exhibit I for a diagram of the Southwest Corridor alignment.
The corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks,
two light rail tracks, and Santa Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is
grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight spur crossing at the Evans Avenue
Station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout
the corridor. To enhance patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight
rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue, and on the west side of the freight corridor
from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate grade separation
between freight railroad and light rail tracks; one near Tufts Avenue where the east/west
transition occurs, and one near Iowa where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.

1.C.4.b

The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a
maximum speed of 55mph. An additional fourteen light rail vehicles were added to the existing
fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles are Siemens Duewag SD100 models,
the same vehicle in use for the Central Corridor. The light rail maintenance facility has been
expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the
Southwest Corridor are similar to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor.
Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, eighteen additional SD 100s have been
placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley Spur
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) Spur is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing
Central Corridor light rail line at Colfax Avenue to the Denver Union Station. This is a doubletrack alignment along the entire corridor including the junction.
The CPV Spur begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and 6th Street (at the location where the
existing Central Corridor light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The
alignment generally follows the Burnham Freight Yard lead track from Colfax Avenue to
approximately 100 feet west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this
point, the alignment turns north and parallels 5th Street to Walnut Street. The alignment crosses
Walnut and the Air Liquid property diagonally to parallel the Consolidated Mainline. The
alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline, past the Pepsi Center, turns south at 16th Street
and ends at the Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new Administration Building of
the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing "Sports Walk" that serves Sports Authority
Field at Mile High Stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving the Pepsi Center and Elitch Gardens;
and the Denver Union Station.
The alignment has several at-grade crossings: 6th Street, Curtis Street, 5th Street, Walnut Street,
Wewatta Street, and 16th Street at Denver Union Station. The alignment includes control and
safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic in these areas. Specifically, these include
active warning devices at the light rail crossing of 5th Street, Walnut Street, 16th Street and
Wewatta Street.
During major events, such as games and concerts at the Pepsi Center, Coors Field and Sports
Authority Field at Mile High Stadium special service will be provided with trains running as
frequently as every four to five minutes between the event venue and the Southwest Corridor.
Some of these special events trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway station while other will
continue to the Mineral Avenue end-of-line station.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. The Southeast Corridor
consists of 30.78 kilometers (19.12 miles) of double-tracked light rail transit, beginning at the
existing Broadway station and ending at Lincoln Avenue. This includes an alignment along I-225
in the median, from I-25 to Parker Road. There are 13 stations: Louisiana; University; Colorado;
Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Dayton; and
Nine Mile: . All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and
other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

1.C.4.b

The Southeast Corridor LRT alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing
Broadway Rail Station. This connection allows LRT vehicles from the Southeast Corridor to
access both the Southwest Corridor and existing LRT line to downtown. Following the wye
tracks, the LRT alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After
crossing Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on ramp and
drops down to match the grade of I-25. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross
streets maintaining a 5.1-meter (17-foot) vertical clearance above the top of rail. Through the
Narrows (Broadway to University) the LRT alignment parallels I-25 between I-25's collector
distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the
highway bridges through a separate LRT bridge structure.
At the University interchange, the LRT alignment moves away from I-25 and runs along the
outside edge of the University off-ramp and rises up to pass over University on the aerial
structure. After crossing University, the LRT alignment continues along the outside edge of the
University on-ramp, returning to an alignment adjacent to the I-25 shoulder and at the same grade
as the highway.
Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the LRT alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under
Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel section. After passing under Colorado, the LRT alignment
remains below grade, in an open trench section, and again parallels I-25, remaining as it passes
under Evans in a tunnel section.
Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the LRT alignment rises up to return to the highway grade running
adjacent to the highway to Yale. At Yale Avenue, the LRT alignment runs along the edge of the
Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the LRT alignment follows along the west side of I-25, to Hampden Avenue. At
Hampden, the LRT alignment enters a very short tunnel section under Hampden and then returns
to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden.
The alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I- 225
freeway interchange. Special track-work at this location allows for a wye connection to the LRT
alignment located along I-225. These connecting tracks are primarily at- grade and pass below the
I-25/I-225 interchange.
Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the LRT alignment passes under Union Avenue
along the west edge of I-25. After passing under Union Avenue, the LRT alignment continues
south to Belleview where it travels along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure.
Continuing south from Belleview, the LRT alignment runs adjacent to I-25 to Orchard where it

interchange, the LRT alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 to the C-470/E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the LRT travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over
C470, around the western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I- 25, where it
continues south to an end-of-line station north of Lincoln Avenue.
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The LRT alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I25 alignment through a wye connection, allowing LRT vehicles to connect to both the
northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 LRT alignment. After the wye connection, the LRT
alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The LRT alignment continues in the
I-225 median to Parker Road where it passes over Parker and terminates with tail tracks on the
north side of Parker.
The Corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors including traction power
substations and signal systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project
and is retrofitted into the existing system.

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April
2013 extending from Denver Union Station (DUS) to Jefferson County, through Denver,
Lakewood and Golden. The West Rail Line has twelve stations including Auraria West,
Decatur/Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Wadsworth, Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red
Rocks Community College, and Jeffco Government Center.
The alignment is double track from DUS to the Federal Center and is single track from the
Federal Center to the Jeffco Government Center station. Total travel time from DUS
to Jefferson County Government Center-Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to
existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station the alignment travels to the Pepsi Center-Elitch Garden
Station, Sports Authority Field at Mile High Station, and then the Auraria West Campus Station.

the descent the alignment goes under the I-25 viaduct and continues onto the West Rail Line
alignment traveling to the Decatur-Federal Station.

I 5.1.4 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system. The SCADA system provides two types of general functions: control over certain system
41
Packet Pg. 101

elements from the Central Control center; and system monitoring and status information to the
Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain capabilities such
as remote capability to power down sections of the alignment and control over power switches. It
also provides information to the light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light
rail system. SCADA information includes: train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal
status and a variety of additional system information.

I 5.1.5 Light Rail Vehicles
The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD
160. The vehicles are very similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC
propulsion system and sliding plug doors where the SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle and there are 49 vehicles in the fleet.
The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68 were delivered with
an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An
additional 29 SD 160 vehicles were added in July 2018.RTD now has a total of 201 vehicles in
revenue service. Refer to Exhibit II for vehicle diagrams.

I 5.1.6 Operations
Central Control, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and
SCADA, governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains
contact with the train operators by means of radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail
operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case of cab radio failure. Controller/Supervisors
rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide support and coordination
between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an emergency or upset in the
system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response
and investigation.
Current operations consist of eight lines; C, D, E, F, H, L, W and R. The C line serves from
Mineral Avenue to Denver Union Station. The D line serves from Mineral Avenue to 30th and
Downing. The E line serves from Lincoln to Denver Union Station. The F line serves from
Lincoln to 18th and California. The H line serves from Nine Mile to 18th and California. The L
line is a downtown loop between 16th and Stout and 30th and Downing. The W line serves from
Jeffco Government Center to Denver Union Station. The R Line which opened February 2017
serves from Nine Mile to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for certain special events. Early morning or late
night headways on weekends and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or breakdown of the system, the controller controls train movement
using a manual block system. When necessary, buses are used in a “bridging” procedure to move
passengers around a trouble area.

regulations, and inspections. Hours of operation are, generally, 3:00 a.m.–1:30 a.m.

I 5.3

BUS OPERATIONS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in
1969 and became an operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency
was to provide a regional approach to public transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting the half percent sales tax and became fully
operational. RTD initially inherited 321 buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was nine million miles per
year, with fewer than 20 million riders annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance
capacity for buses in the small system operating in the District. These systems served several
local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six
fragmented bus systems that had provided service to different areas of the District were integrated
into a single, unified system. New and improved service became the focal points for future
growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes, new local and express routes; more
frequent service; new nighttime service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas
of the District; exclusive bus lanes and the inauguration of special service for the elderly and
disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to service the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors
led to a significant increase in ridership.
To support and encourage new riders, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n- Ride
facilities. Additional bus maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the
growing bus fleet.
The Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit
concept, which would pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and
provide opportunities for additional suburban service.
The District has evolved into a transit system that has a service area of 2,348 square miles. It
serves 40 municipalities in 8 counties. The system is comprised of 148 routes. The fleet currently
has 1011 buses of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently four maintenance
and storage facilities District wide, 77 Park-n-Rides and 6 transfer stations.

Packet Pg. 103

1.C.4.b

Regular service of the bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and
off-peak hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of
344,339 weekday boarding’s. Denver Union Street Station and Civic Center Station are the main
transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The Bus Safety Compliance Officer’s office will be located at the Bus Operations center. Thus,
the lines of communication between System Safety and Bus Operations are effective. Key
positions with Bus Operations are the Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, Deputy
Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, General Superintendent of Bus Transportation,
Manager of Bus Transportation, General Superintendent of Bus Maintenance, Manager of Bus
Maintenance, and Manager of Street Supervision. All of these key positions have daily contact
with the Bus Safety Compliance Officer.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch
maintains control with bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and the
Global Positioning System. Street Supervisors also carry portable radios in the event of a system
failure. Street supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their role is to provide
support and coordination between Dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient service to all
areas served by our mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from
four divisions with 910 full-time and 133 part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days
a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street Supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to insure the safe, efficient,
on-time delivery of scheduled bus service. The District also provides continuous evaluation of
routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters and facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of
the service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles.
Information is received and relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination
for bus operations. Communication is provided through the radio system, telephones, and a stateof the art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, who operate
approximately 50% of RTD’s fixed route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit
centers, transfer stations and the Telephone Information Center. The District also coordinates
special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and Street
Supervisors will coordinate bus activities.

I 6 Integration with Public Safety and Emergency
Management
I 6.1

System Security Plan (SSP)

The security program for RTD is described in the System Security Plan (SSP) filed with the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The
SSP is considered sensitive security information (SSI) per 49 CFR 15 and 1520, with distribution
controlled to only those with a need-to-know. The SSP complies with DHS guidance including
the National Response Framework, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National
Preparedness Goal. For response to terrorism or natural disaster incidents, RTD Emergency
Management Plan is based on partnerships with the Urban Area Security Initiative working
group, and first-responder organizations of cities and counties throughout RTD's service area.
For traditional security functions as well as terrorism prevention, RTD's plans are based upon a
formally-adopted policy of awareness, observation and reporting by all employees, especially
front-line personnel, combined with effective responses by both RTD Security Operations
Command and first-responder law enforcement and emergency management organizations. RTD
riders are also asked to report suspicious behaviors or packages to employees, the RTD Security
Command Center, via the RTD Transit Watch App for mobile phones, or call 9-1-1 in the event
of an incident. RTD's Transit Police Division works in partnership with Police and Sheriff’s
departments throughout RTD's service area for high responsiveness to calls for police assistance
on the transit system, for application of the RTD Code of Conduct throughout the RTD service
area, and for effective criminal investigations and prosecutions. In support of security awareness
and reporting by transit system employees, RTD design criteria for new service projects applies
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles, and provides Closed
Circuit Television and other equipment throughout the system to enhance security.

I 6.2

Emergency Management

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit
service during a special event, emergency, or during the recovery from a catastrophic incident,
including but not limited to:
 Earthquake
 Fire
 Flooding
 Hazardous material spill
 Medical emergency
 Severe weather
 Transit related accidents
 Acts of Violence

1.C.4.b

Acts of terrorism

A more extensive discussion of RTD emergency management activities is contained in the RTD
Emergency Preparedness Plans, which are being developed/revised for RTD. Each mode within
RTD has the requirement to develop their specific emergency response plan. Light Rail
Emergency Response Plan, Commuter Rail Emergency response Plan and Bus Emergency
Preparedness Plan. These plans detail activities and responsibilities for Rail Service personnel
and are the responsibility of the Safety Department. This plan (along with the safety program
documents and SSP) also describes coordination of the following emergency
preparedness/management activities:
 Incident management – RTD management of an emergency event or incident is based on
the principles of NIMS and the Incident Command System (ICS). Using National
Incident Management System (NIMS) principles allows emergency response agencies to
communicate with RTD Field Supervisors and/or the RTD Security Command Center
(SCC) by clearly identifying responsibilities and designated individuals assigned to those
responsibilities in accordance with ICS. The structure of the ICS can be as simple as a
single RTD Field Supervisor responding to an incident, or may require the activation of a
field Incident Command Post or the RTD Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 Coordination with external agencies – the RTD Chief of Police and Emergency
Management is principally responsible for the coordination of incident management
resources with various emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction
between RTD and those agencies. Liaison with law enforcement agencies is primarily
the responsibility of the Chief Safety Officer, with assistance from the Chief of Police
and Emergency Management
 Emergency response planning and mitigation – RTD establishes a Fire/Life Safety and
Security Committee for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee is comprised of safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and
engineering representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area
emergency response agency representatives. The committee reviews transit system
designs and recommends fire protection, life safety and security measures, and
procedural response and training needs related to the new extension or facility project.
 Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan
area, RTD is a member of the Regional Emergency Management COOP and Urban Area
Security Initiative (UASI). It is RTD’s intent to develop a task force with regional
Emergency Management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response,
recovery, and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the
metropolitan area, emergency response agencies, RTD, utility companies, and other
critical groups. RTD, with assistance from the Fire/Life Safety and Security Committee,
has developed emergency management operating plans and procedures to address a wide
range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity, earthquakes, fire at
transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases, medical
emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the RTD transit system.
 Emergency preparedness exercises – a minimum of one emergency tabletop or field
exercise is planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans
and procedures; readiness of RTD personnel to perform under emergency conditions;
effective coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination
of regional emergency exercises that are facilitated through……. All exercises are

followed by after-action analyses and reports to document lessons learned and actions
needed to improve RTD’s emergency operations capabilities.
Emergency response training – All front line RTD transportation and maintenance
personnel will undergo emergency response training to ensure they have a full
understanding of their role and responsibility during an emergency incident. The level of
training will be based on their anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum,
training is provided on the emergency plans and procedures that the employee may be
required to implement. Training to familiarize fire, rescue, and other emergency service
personnel with special transit system requirements is coordinated through the Fire and
Life Safety Committees and Safety and Security staff with assistance from the
Transportation and Maintenance Departments, as appropriate.

I 7 Hazard/Risk Management Overview
The hazard management program is developed and implemented by the Safety and
Environmental Division. Under the direction of the RTD Chief Safety and Security Officer,
Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior Manager of
Safety and Environmental is responsible for managing this program. RTD utilizes the American
Passenger Transportation Association (APTA) guidelines and Military Standard 882E regarding
the identification and classification of hazards based on severity and probability. The hazard risk
index matrix is used to determine the overall hazard risk index. Hazard identification and
notification is accomplished in a variety of ways. Any employee may report potential hazards to
the Safety and Environmental Division by: use of the RTD safety issue/hazard reporting systems
that include Safety Committees, Safety Concern Reporting (HUB), Safety Hotline, Safety
@RTD-Denver.com, and Safety Suggestion boxes, or by contacting any of the Safety Division
staff or their immediate supervisor. Many hazards are reported and managed through the safety
committee process. Hazards will also be reported through formal mechanisms such as facility and
equipment inspections, internal safety reviews, system modification proposals, design review,
safety open items lists, integrated testing, and safety and security certification. This is an
integrated, system-wide approach to hazard management.
Once identified and reported, the Safety and Environmental Division will conduct a formal
hazard analysis. All identified hazards will be tracked by the Safety and Environmental Division
and documented in the RTD Hazard/Event system. Regarding hazard control and elimination, the
system safety or hazard reduction precedence will be applied: design for minimum risk (eliminate
hazard through design when feasible/practical); incorporate safety devices; provide warning
devices; and develop policies, procedures and training.
The State Safety Oversight rules require that transit agencies with fixed rail guideways develop
and implement a hazard management program. The requirements include that the program
identify minimum thresholds, using RTD system data for the notification and reporting of hazards
to the oversight agency. For RTD’s program, hazards defined as meeting the minimum threshold

of hazard risk assessment matrix “High/unacceptable” – 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 3A) will be
reported to the PUC as soon as practicable, but not later than 24 hours from the time of
occurrence or discovery. Hazard investigation reports will be provided to the PUC within 45 days
of the initial report date and include all PUC required information including a corrective action
plan and schedule for implementation. RTD will provide the PUC with quarterly progress reports

for hazards defined as reportable to the PUC. Refer to section 3.3.2 for additional information on
hazard management program. Hazards that do not fall into the “High/Unacceptable” category
will be reported to the PUC in monthly reports and will have all corrective action plans created
and implemented by RTD staff as outlined in the Safety Risk Management and Safety Assurance
sections of the PTASP.

Hazard management for the existing and future commuter rail system is described in Commuter
Rail Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.

Safety Assurance Overview

Safety Assurance is accomplished through implementation of safety oversight and risk
monitoring activities. As RTD implements its SMS, several activities will be initiated and tools
will be developed to support these safety oversight and risk monitoring activities. Safety
assurance includes safety reviews, evaluations, reviews, and inspections, as well as safety data
collection, tracking, and analysis, from various sources, including investigations; and
development of Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s).
Safety Assurance also requires RTD to describe safety performance measures, and RTD will
initially focus on areas based on existing data delivered to the National Transit Database (NTD),
as the following:
 Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
 Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by
mode
 Safety Events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles
by mode
 System Reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode
These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four
measures and each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor safety
performance of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD will select additional performance
measures, both leading and lagging, to insure continual improvement of our Safety Management
System.

I 8.1

Management of Change

Change Management is critical to an effective Safety Assurance program. The primary purpose of
change management, system modification, and safety and security certification is to ensure that
changes to the baseline/existing or significant capital projects for the transit system are reviewed
for conformance with existing RTD standards and to identify and assess potential hazards before
making changes to documents, equipment, facilities, or transit routes. Safety critical operational
documents, bus and rail fixed facilities, revenue and non-revenue vehicles equipment, and transit
routes are subject to change management and formal document control procedures. They include,
but are not limited to, agency policies standard operating procedures, emergency operating
procedures, safety and operating rules, training materials, drawings, and engineering reference
information.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

51
Packet Pg. 111

These documents are subject to review or revision as a result of (not exclusive):
 Incidents or mishaps
 Major service changes, excluding routine schedule adjustments
 Line extensions
 Accumulation of special instructions or notices, which warrant revision to a “parent”
document
 Proposed design changes to facilities, equipment, or vehicles.
 External TOD, improvements, right of way permit requests, etc.
 Policy changes
RTD will be developing and implementing a Change Review Committee (CRC) in 2019 to ensure
all changes are reviewed and analyzed prior to implementation. Details of the change
management process and the safety and security certification process can be found in the Safety
Assurance Section of the PTASP. In addition, the RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan
and State of Good Repair efforts are managed separately, but are inputs to the SMS processes.

I 8.2

Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is defined by FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines
safety performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies. RTD uses Continuous Improvement Teams (CIT) as temporary teams of
managers, supervisors, and frontline employees assembled to address specific safety and security
issues. The teams are temporary, typically lasting several weeks or months; until the team actions
are fully implemented. CIT’s have addressed many processes and concerns already (Maybe list
some of these) In addition, SS&AM directed teams evaluate risks/safety concerns, create and
execute Corrective Action Plans, when needed, to continuously improve the safety of RTD. These
team activities are also expected to include any improvements and changes needed for the RTD
SMS based on experience and changes in the risk environment.

I9

Safety Promotion Overview

Safety promotion includes safety culture, safety-related lessons learned, and reporting systems,
recommendations based on safety metrics, data, and safety training. The intent of safety
promotion is to foster a positive safety culture in which RTD employees receive ongoing training
and updates of safety progress; feel comfortable reporting safety issues or concerns; and
understand why safety is important and how staff actions or inactions impact safety. Through
safety promotion, the Leadership Team broadcasts its commitment to safety and the SMS, and
demonstrates its commitment to the importance of safety.
The RTD Safety Promotion plans focus on three main areas:
1. Safety Culture - A positive safety culture focuses on finding and correcting systemic
issues rather than finding someone or something to blame. A positive safety culture
flourishes in an environment of trust, encouraging error-reporting and discouraging
covering up mistakes. The need to address behavior that is malicious or recklessly
negligent must be balanced with the need for a just culture that is not excessively
punitive. A positive safety culture goes beyond simply adhering to procedures. It is

1.C.4.b

52
Packet Pg. 112

1.C.4.b

2. Safety Communication - Effective communication of safety risks is critical and a key
component of the safety culture.
A Safety Promotion Communication Plan will be created with the assistance of the RTD
Communication Department. The Safety Promotion Communication Plan will include at least the
following topics:
 Dissemination of safety messages, progress towards safety performance targets, and
lessons learned
 Safety Hazards and risks
 Inform employees of actions taken in response to Safety Concern Reporting and trends
 Measuring or assessing safety culture
 Safety culture promotion
Safety Communication also includes the riders of the transit systems and the public that interacts
with the transit system. RTD leads and participates in several safety outreach activities and
provides safety awareness messages for riders and the public. The RTD Senior Specialist, Safety
Communications works directly with the SS&AM department to ensure a consistent internal and
external safety messaging.
3. Safety Training - Appropriate safety training is provided for each employee
commensurate with their position.
All RTD personnel will receive training to become familiar with:
 Safety Management Systems Overview
 Safety Reporting /Risk Management
 Safety Assurance
 Employee Roles and Responsibilities

I 9.1

Specific Job Safety Training

Safety specific training is provided by the division and department for employees. The training
includes an understanding of safety risks and controls, rules, and procedures. It is the
responsibility of department managers and supervisors to ensure the training requirements are
identified and fulfilled. SS&AM coordinates with department training instructors in formulating
and refining the training programs.
Managers and supervisors must arrange appropriate safety training for each position. This
includes both technical and non-technical training, on-the-job training, and refresher training.
Trainers must be competent and qualified in the delivery of training. A complete and
comprehensive training and qualification record by employee is maintained.
Suitable qualifications of employees are maintained and revalidated in accordance with the
requirements of the division and department, and regulatory requirements.

Pillar II of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Risk Management, describing how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks and mitigates hazards and risk in the organization and on the
transit system. In this pillar, the processes undertaken by the authority are provided in sufficient
detail to be effectively undertaken. Acceptable risk levels, performance targets and mitigation
measures are established.

II

Risk Management Program

II 1.1 Hazard Management
The management of identified hazards is a vital component of the RTD Safety Management
System. A hazard is defined as a condition or set of conditions, internal or external to the RTD
system, which when activated could cause injury or death or damage or loss of equipment or
property. An unacceptable hazard is a condition that may endanger human life or property or
result in system loss. This includes harm to passengers, employees, contractors, equipment, and to
the general public. These hazardous conditions must be mitigated. Hazards are identified in
several different internal and external sources. Hazards may be observed in the operating
environment, through procedures, during system modifications and capital projects, accidents,
extensions or operational changes.
RTD has implemented the guidance as outlined in FTA’s Clarification letter September 6, 2007
on the hazard management requirements. The Hazard Management Program applies to all RTD
employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe hazards in their work areas and report
them to their safety committee, the safety compliance officer or to their supervisor or manager.
The overall hazard management program incorporates a system-wide hazard identification
process, including activities for:
 Identification
 Investigation
 Evaluation and analysis
 Control and elimination
 Tracking
 Ongoing reporting to PUC SSO and RTD senior management relating to hazard
management activities and status

II 1.1.2

Local Hazard Management

RTD Department Managers will play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure
that the process has been fully integrated within their departments. Managers will also ensure the
following elements of the hazard management process are present in their departments:
 Ensure employees have the ability to report hazards to management in person or through
the use of the electronic hazard reporting form via the hub;
 Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation;

committee;
Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual /Point Of Contact;
Participate in assigning hazard ratings (in accordance with the RTD Risk Assessment
Matrix); and
Ensure employees receive appropriate hazard management training.

II 1.1.3

Local Hazard Logs

Department managers along with safety compliance officers will ensure local hazard logs are
used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained
within the department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis.
Hazards placed on the local log receive their initial and final hazard rating using RTD’s 21 box
risk assessment matrix. Management may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are
received and final ratings when they are closed. Management may also present hazards to the
local safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the Safety Department for assistance in rating
hazards. Hazard ratings may be changed when new information or as a result of data analysis.

II 1.1.4

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the
local safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding
Safety Department Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the future Safety and Security Review
Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will represent key department managers that have the ability to
make decisions and will employ multiple disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level
budgeted solutions.

II 1.1.5

Safety Department Hazard Logs

Safety Compliance Officers (SCO) are responsible for the maintenance of Safety Department
Hazard Logs. SCO’s ensure that hazards meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate
category within the Hazard Reporting System for accurate record keeping. Hazard rating can be
assigned by the either the SCO or the future SSRC. The following are Specific hazards that are
identified and mitigated at the corporate level:
 Unacceptable hazards (High Hazards);
 Hazards identified from reviews from outside agency’s (PUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA);
 Hazards identified from accident investigations;
 Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000;
 Serious or high hazards on local department hazard log over 180 day;
 When warranted by the Safety Department

II 1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

Corrective action plans are utilized within RTD for hazards that meet certain criteria. The
following hazards require the usage of a corrective action plan:
 Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);




Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations;
When warranted by the Safety Department

In the following instances corrective action plans must receive prior approval by the SSO
Manager before corrective action plans may be carried out:
 Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards);
 Review findings from regulatory agencies resulting in Non-conformance (PUC, FTA,
FRA, OSHA);
 Accident investigations requiring corrective action,
 Testing or reviews of Industrial Hygiene which potentially exceed OSHA PEL limits,
CAP’s are assigned a specific tracking numbers by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and
are and are linked with its associated hazard. CAP’s must contain at a minimum:
 A person of responsibility for the corrective action
 A proposed completion date
 Plan approval when applicable

II 1.1.7

Corrective Action Plan Development

Corrective action plans are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the
Safety Department and associated safety committees (Local Safety Committee, future SSRC, and
ESSC). Accident Evaluation Groups (to be formalized) will also be utilized when developing
CAP’s resulting from hazards identified after an accident. SCO’s will ensure that the CAP
process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed.

II 1.2 Hazard Process Overview
RTD's hazard process includes light rail, commuter rail, and bus systems. The following hazard
management flow chart lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated,
analyzed, controlled or eliminated, tracked and reported to RTD senior management and PUC
State Safety Oversight.
 The Safety Compliance officers assigned to light rail, bus, and capital projects are the
primary points of contact (POC) for the hazard management process.
 Safety Committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze
hazards.
 The SCO’s will enter identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system.
 The SCO and or committee will develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for each
unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry and identify point of contact or owner of the
hazard and places this information within the hazard reporting system for tracking
purposes.
 CAP's may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation.
 Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of
the hazard.
 Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is
identified as having a mitigation that involves multiple departments, or requires cost or

changes beyond the safety committee or department abilities or budgets the hazard will
be elevated to the future Safety and Security Review Committee (SSRC). The SSRC will
represent key department managers and have the capability to employ multiple
disciplines at RTD and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.
Recommendations/Results from Contractor or Internal review, testing, industrial or
environmental sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard
log for follow up and possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or
Environmental requirements.
If mitigation or control of a hazard is not achieved through the future SSRC, the hazard
mitigation process may be elevated to the Chief Safety Officer’s Safety and Security
Committee (ESSC) for final resolution.

II 1.3 Hazard Identification
Identification of hazards is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. The
continuous identification, monitoring, and elimination of hazards is key to an effective system
safety program.
 Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
 Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors,
 Reports from safety committee members, passengers, customer service, and field
personnel,
 Evaluation of accidents, incidents, near misses, to include data trends and projections.
 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction,
 Safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system modification,
configuration management verification, and inspection processes,
 Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations
 Internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews
 Controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback
 "Lesson learned" inputs.
 Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards
 "NTSB, FRA, FTA, OSHA, safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts
 Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports (NCR and CARS)
Examples of observed hazards may include:
 An uneven sidewalk joint that could cause a trip and fall
 Opening in a section of corridor fencing which allows access of a trespasser
 A forklift that has an oil or hydraulic leak
 Ice formation on stairway
 Missing fire extinguisher in a maintenance shop
The RTD hazard logs (by mode – light rail, bus) are managed by the safety compliance officers
(SCO). Hazards identified by an employee to his/her supervisor may be resolved by the employee
and supervisor. For example, a discharged fire extinguisher may be identified by an employee and
brought to the attention of his/her supervisor and the supervisor gives the employee authorization
to order a newly charged extinguisher from the supply room for a replacement. If the supervisor
is unable to solve the identified hazard, he/she will forward the hazard to a safety committee
representative to be brought to the safety committee for resolution. The safety committee and
SCO will review the hazard and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR) and place the hazard into the

in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level and actions taken to move
the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

Potential Sources of Hazard Identification

II 1.4 Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis
RTD is currently in the process of developing and refining a database where incidents and
observed hazards can be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This
will allow management to be proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns should be identified and corrected at the lowest level (employee/department) as
soon as practicable. Safety concerns that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a safety
compliance officer. Reported concerns will be assessed by the SCO and or safety committee to
determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial hazard rating (IHR).

II 1.4.1

Root Cause Analysis and Accident Evaluation

Hazards are investigated as they are identified through evaluating accidents, incidents, and near
misses. Hazards originating from accidents are reviewed by the safety compliance officer and
respective safety evaluation committees. As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause
analysis using the “FIVE Why?” methodology is used to help focus on the bottom-line
fundamental cause and determine the most effective solutions to mitigating hazards. The primary
purpose of the accident evaluation process is to determine root causes potential hazards that may
have contributed to an incident. A third party expert may be used to assist with an investigation if
deemed necessary. This will be determined based upon a RTD hazard assessments, to be
determined frequent and high (Catastrophic HIGH).
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis
made by management, safety committee or the safety compliance officer receive immediate
attention/control. A high hazard rating requires corrective action.
Hazards that receive a high hazard rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

Packet Pg. 121

SERIOUS hazards (1D, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and
decisions by management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local
hazard logs no more than 150 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety Department
Log.
MEDIUM (1E, 2D, 2E, 3C, 3D, 3E, 4A, 4B) hazards may be acceptable with review by
management. Events from a medium hazard are less likely to occur and are less severe in nature.
LOW (4C, 4D, 4E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.
ELIMINATED hazard is no longer present.

II 1.4.2

Hazard Reporting Threshold to PUC

RTD will notify PUC of all hazardous conditions that affect the immediate safety or security of
the rail system. At a minimum, RTD notifies PUC within one business day, according to the
notification procedures in the PUC standard, of hazardous conditions that are rated as High and
set forth in the transit agency’s Hazard Identification/Resolution Matrix:
 I-A (Catastrophic/Frequent)
 II-A (Critical/Frequent)
 I-B (Catastrophic/Probable)
 II-B (Critical/Probable)
 I-C (Catastrophic/Occasional)
RTD is responsible for assigning severity/probability ratings to hazardous conditions.
RTD will include in its hazard log and hazard management process all hazardous conditions,
incidents, occurrences, and events that meet the criteria listed below:
 Incidents involving individuals working in the transit agency-controlled right of way that
are investigated by the transit agency.
 Malfunctions of safety-critical systems that could result, or have resulted in catastrophic
or single-point failure.
 Broken or missing safety-critical equipment, infrastructure, or systems that could result,
or have resulted, in employee or passenger injury, or damage to RTD property.
 Discoveries of systemic or patterns of employee non-compliance with transit agency
rules and procedures.
 Rail transit vehicle collisions with fixed objects on the mainline or in the yards.
 Rail transit vehicle derailments in the yards.
 Face-up or near miss of rail vehicles.
 Grade crossing warning system activation failure.
 Speed restriction or track closure due to track or facility damage.
 Fire or smoke on the track, on a vehicle, or in a facility.
 Broken or loose wheel or axle.
 Fallen or dragging rail vehicle equipment
 Split switch without derailment
 Train uncoupling in revenue service.
 Signal violation or overrun.

Hazard Severity

Hazard severity is a subjective determination of the worst case that could be anticipated to result
from human error, design inadequacies, component failure or malfunction. The categories of
hazards based on the modified MIL-STD-882 are as follows:
Category 1 Catastrophic - Operating conditions are such that human error, design deficiencies,
element, subsystem or component failure or procedural deficiencies may cause death or major
system loss and require immediate termination of the unsafe activity or operation
Category 2 Critical - operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies may cause severe injury, severe occupational illness or major
system damage and require immediate corrective action.
Category 3 Marginal - Operating conditions are such that they may result in minor injury,
occupational illness or system damage and are such that human error, subsystem or component
failures can be counteracted or controlled.
Category 4 Negligible - Operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component
failure or procedural deficiencies will result in less than minor injury, occupational illness or
system damage.
The categorization of hazards is consistent with risk-based criteria for severity; it reflects the
principle that not all hazards pose an equal amount of risk to personal safety.

II 1.4.45

Hazard Probability

The probability of a particular event or a specific hazard occurring may be defined as a nondimensional ratio of the number of times that a specific event occurs to the total number of trials
in which this event will occur during the planned life expectancy of a system. Generally, hazard
probability is described qualitatively in potential occurrences per units of time, miles, trips/runs
or passengers carried. A hazard probability may be derived from the analysis of transit system
operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety data, the analysis of reliability and failure data, or
from historical safety data from other passenger rail systems or bus systems. (see Exhibit VIII)

1.C.4.b

Packet Pg. 125

II 1.4.6

Hazard or Risk Assessments

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk for each identified hazard to determine
what action(s) must be taken to correct or document the hazard risk. This assessment system has
been incorporated into the formal system safety analysis which enables the Safety Compliance
Officer or safety committees as decision makers to understand the amount of risk involved in
accepting the hazard in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to reduce the hazard to an
acceptable level.
The Hazard Matrix (6.4.2) identifies the hazard risk index (HRI) based upon hazard category and
probability and the criteria for defining further actions based upon the index.

II 1.5

Hazard Control, Elimination, and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or eliminated so that the
hazard does not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner as long as
the hazard is controlled. The process of controlling, tracking, and elimination, of hazards is
recorded on the hazard log which is generated from the electronic hazard reporting system. The
hazard log will be forwarded to PUC SSO on a monthly basis.
All hazard log entries require a corrective action plan (CAP), tracking number, brief description,
projected completion date, and an initial hazard rating (IHR) using the RTD Hazard Analysis
Matrix.
Corrective action plans include the following information:
 Element of activity identified as deficient
 Planned activities to resolve deficiency
 RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
 Scheduled completion date for implementation
 Estimated cost of implementation
Hazard log entries with their associated corrective action plan are reviewed regularly by the
safety department, safety committees, PUC SSO and periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAP's may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed the
hazard log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored in the enterprise content management system Laserfiche by
hazard tracking number.

Hazard Resolution and Elimination

Hazard resolution is defined as the analysis and subsequent actions taken to reduce to the lowest
level practical, the risk associated with an identified hazard. Hazard resolution is not synonymous
with hazard elimination. In a transit environment, there are some hazards, which are impossible to
eliminate and others, which are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk to the lowest
practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways from protective and warning devices to
special procedures.
1. Design out or design to minimize hazard severity. To the extent permitted by cost and
practicality, identified hazards will be eliminated or controlled by the design of
equipment, systems and facilities.
2. Hazards that cannot reasonably be eliminated or controlled through design will be
controlled to the extent practicable to an acceptable level through the use of fixed,
automatic, or other protective safety design features or devices. Provisions will be made
for periodic functional checks of safety devices and training for employees to ensure that
system safety objectives are met.
3. When design and safety devices cannot reasonably nor effective, eliminate or control an
identified hazard, safety warning devices will be used (to the extent practicable) to alert
persons to the hazards.
4. Where it is impossible to reasonably eliminate or adequately control a hazard through
design of the use of safety warning devices, procedures and training will be used to
control the hazard.

II 1.6

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards, findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted
to PUC SSO as required for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a
tracking number and placed on the Hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the
corrective action the safety department will submit to PUC as required. The completed CAP is
formally adopted by receiving PUC SSO's signature. The Hazard Log will then be updated to
show the status of the identified hazard with its CAP to "CLOSED".
RTD will monitor all Corrective Action Plans with the use of the RTD Hazard Log and will
provide PUC with an updated hazard log monthly.
Internally, the safety department will coordinate with the appropriate department to develop a
Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and fill out a CAP form for the identified hazard. The CAP form
will be assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the
hazard log with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

Ongoing Reporting To State Safety Oversight Agency

The safety compliance officer will review the current status and identify any issues with the
resolution action and dates. The hazard log, at a minimum is provided to the SSO monthly
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked
and reported to PUC along with the corrective action plans for each unacceptable hazardous
condition found. All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be
separately tracked and reported to PUC with determination of an unacceptable hazardous
condition.
PUC will notify RTD in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the corrective action plan and in
accordance with procedures specified in the PUC SSO standard. The RTD CAP form requires the
PUC SSO electronic or wet signature approval indicating the assigned resolution and completion
of the CAP. The CAP is maintained in the Laserfiche hazard reporting system files and is
identified by a specific hazard log identifier tracking number. After a hazard has been resolved, it
will be assigned its final hazard rating.

II 1.8

Job Safety Briefing

Hazards that are identified in the work area will be recorded on the hazard log which is
maintained by the Safety Compliance Officer to the specific transportation mode at RTD. All
employees are encouraged to identify and control or resolve hazards at the lowest management
level possible. Employees that perform job tasks are required to discuss job tasks and identified
hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during job briefings. Identified hazards
that cannot be controlled with PPE or procedures must be resolved or mitigated through the
hazard management process.

Environmental Management System and Policy Manual

An environmental management system (EMS) is in place at RTD to assure that all materials
ordered have safety data sheet (SDS) forms shipped with the materials or prior to shipment. If
these types of materials are ordered, they are not received until the SDS is provided. SDS forms
are forwarded to the safety compliance officers and environmental compliance officer who place
the forms in the appropriate SDS database in RTD’s facilities and electronic system.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

Packet Pg. 128

RTD will develop a comprehensive Environmental Management System Policy Manual that will
have jurisdiction over all hazardous materials activities and aspects of the organization. RTD
employees and department managers will be provided with and will be required to comply with
this management system. The manual and the EMS standard operating procedures (SOPs) will
require RTD personnel to comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
The EMS policy manual will govern hazardous materials procurement, receiving, storage, use,
and disposal, as well as complying with legal and other requirements. A continual process of
assessment, corrections, and improvement will be adopted by RTD management as a part of the
adoption of the environmental management system program.
During 2013 the new addition of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) was announced by
OSHA. RTD has incorporated awareness training and announced the new changes to the Hazard
Communications 29 CFR 1200 which are to be implemented over the next two years. All
material safety data sheets (MSDS) will change format and be known as SDS sheets and are
accessible through an Intranet-based system. All MSDS/SDS are available through the SharePoint
Site:
https://otis.osmanager4.com/#/chemical/righttoknow?rtkid=61fabd57-17a7-4a23-88d708aa3caec485&hv=7EBC55B743Z39E5A3578D01BB9E04008
Each employee receives training on hazardous materials management and is instructed as to their
responsibilities right to know about potential hazards that they work with. RTD's safety and
environmental compliance officers, as described in the EMS manual, review compliance with this
manual.

II 2.3

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, RTD facilities must maintain a
safety data sheet (SDS), and submit the SDSs (or a list of the chemicals) to their state emergency
response commission (SERC), local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and local fire
department. RTD facilities must also report an annual inventory of these chemicals by March 1 of
each year to their SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. The Environmental Department has
been given this reporting responsibility. The information must be made available to the public.
There are over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and over 600 extremely hazardous chemicals
subject to reporting. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity. RTD submits an
annual Tier II chemical inventory report for our facilities that are subject to reporting.
The common hazardous materials used by RTD that are subject to reporting are:
 Diesel Fuel
 Gasoline
 New and used oil
 Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)
 Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

The liquids are stored in tanks or drums within secondary containment. RTD also uses many
hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and aerosols. These
hazardous materials are described in the product-specific safety data sheets (SDS).
69
Packet Pg. 129

RTD is also a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is a hazardous
material that has outlived its usefulness or has become contaminated through use. Hazardous
wastes, can be generated by:
 Discarding a hazardous material (oil-based paint, pesticides, some soaps, expired
products)
 Using a product (used batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, paint thinner, aerosol
dregs)
Hazardous wastes are stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas.
These containers are labeled hazardous waste and are located near where the waste is generated.
The environmental compliance officers are responsible for preparing appropriate manifests,
scheduling hazardous materials transportation, and final disposal.

Pillar III of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Assurance, which describes
how RTD will measure and review its processes to ensure that it remains in compliance with
established standards. These processes and reports will provide the confidence to RTD leadership
that the organization and system is functioning in an acceptable level of safety. The reviews,
inspections, rules checks and compliance verification procedures are described, required
schedules set and acceptable measures established.

III 1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually
parallel to the PUC to assure compliance with the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan and
that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. The overall light rail system is reviewed to assure that activities
required by RTD’s operating, maintenance, and Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan are
completed. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed to the various light rail
departments reviewed. The Executive Safety and Security Committee may also discuss safety
reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, recommend
corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An annual
internal light rail review report is compiled in January of each year and submitted to the PUC by
February 15 of each year. The report documents the review findings for the year including the
results of the internal reviews performed during the previous year, a summary of required
corrective actions taken, if any, and provision for follow up to ensure timely implementation and
to determine effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. The annual report
will be accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the General Manager indicating
that the RTD is in compliance with its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan and system
security plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the General Manager, by letter, will identify
the activities RTD will take to achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are
maintained in the Safety and Environmental Division.
As part of the safety review program, all RTD departments are subject to review. Under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year, one in the spring and one in the
fall. Within a three-year period, all system safety plan elements are reviewed for compliance with
the plan and state safety oversight requirements. The sixth review cycle is usually reserved to
review and revise the review process to assure that all elements are completed and that the
program meets the state safety oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review. The review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. . Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review
cycle is complete.

Packet Pg. 132

An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review; in some
cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the checklists are
distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy; the schedule is then set
with the affected departments. The actual internal safety review consists of interviews with key
personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite activities, the
checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the affected parties. Parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties.
Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the annual
internal safety review report is prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of
the adequacy and effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles. Findings will be tracked
under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

III 1.1 System Safety Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and safety reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual safety reviews are conducted in parallel with the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission to document compliance with established standard operating procedures,
maintenance plans and the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. Any deviations from
required activities or identified safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.
For additional information on system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 1.2 Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting and Corrective Action Plans
Formal investigations shall be conducted for all light rail and bus accidents. All accidents are
investigated by either a Light Rail Supervisor or Transportation Street Supervisor Regarding bus
accidents, if damage is minor, personnel are unavailable or certain weather conditions exist,
operators may be instructed by Dispatch or law enforcement personnel to just complete an
accident report. Subsequent accident investigation reports are completed and distributed to the
Operations Division and the Safety and Environmental Division.
Light rail control will notify Safety Division of every accident that meets the criteria listed below.
Upon notification, Safety Division will determine the level of investigation to be performed by
the Safety Unit. Light rail accidents and incidents are investigated according to RTD Standard
Operating Procedure 103.2 – Incident/Accident Investigation.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

This procedure is included as Exhibit V.
Safety Division personnel will either conduct light rail accident investigations or evaluate
accident investigation reports conducted by others, determine which agencies require notification
73
Packet Pg. 133

and make notification, determine most probable cause, prepare all necessary reports for the PUC
and other agencies, coordinate the preparation and implementation of corrective action plans if
necessary, prepare an accident tracking matrix, and provide summaries to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee. Light rail accidents will be tracked and evaluated by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee. The Safety Division will also coordinate all accident
investigation activities with the PUC and will provide as much advance notice as practical to
notify the PUC of an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in rule
7347(a), RTD will give prior sufficient telephone or facsimile notice to the PUC's staff of the
times that an accident investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections,
examinations, or tests to determine the cause of the accident.
Serious bus accidents are similarly investigated by the Accident Investigation Team consisting of
the following members: Street Supervisors, Manager of Dispatch-Street Supervision, Liability
Claims Representative, Division Manager, Manager of the bus operator’s division, Transportation
Manager of the bus operator’s division, Safety Compliance Officer/Bus Operations, and
Technical Services Representative.
Notification is required within two hours pursuant to 4 CCR 723-7-7348(a) for any accident
occurring on an RFGPTS where one or more of the following occurs:
1. Fatality at the scene, or confirmation of death within 30 days of accident
2. Serious Injuries as defined in Rule 7341 (tt) requiring immediate medical attention away
from the scene for one or more individuals
3. Property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
4. An evacuation due to life safety reasons
5. A collision at a grade crossing
6. A derailment of a rail transit vehicle
7. A runaway train
8. A collision between a rail transit vehicle and a second rail transit vehicle, or a rail transit
non-revenue vehicle
Accident notification under 4-CCR 723-7, 7347(b) is not required by RTD as RTD has no light
rail track that is shared with the general railroad system.
RTD will also provide accident follow-up notification by fax or e-mail in the form of a checklist
to the PUC including the following information:
 The nature of the accident as described above.
 The time, date, and location of the accident.
 The time and date of the notification to the PUC.
 A description of the vehicles, rail transit vehicles, passengers, individuals, rail transitcontrolled property, and other property involved in the accident and the direction they
were traveling at the time of the incident, if known.
For accidents involving a rail transit vehicle or taking place on rail transit-controlled property
where one or more of the above thresholds are met, the RTD will conduct accident investigations
for RTD and on behalf of the PUC. Written accident investigation reports will be provided to the
PUC within 45 days from the date of occurrence and shall include the following:

III 1.3 Collect, Analyze and Report System Safety Data, and Maintain Records
76
Packet Pg. 136

System safety data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information,
accident investigation reports, internal safety reviews, safety committee meetings, occupational
injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident matrix, system monitoring including testing
and inspection records, and the hazard management program. The information collected from
these sources is analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are reported to
appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports, memos, and recommendations from
the Executive Safety and Security Committee. Records of system safety data are maintained in
the office of the Safety and Environmental Division. Certain information, such as safety
certification back up documentation is maintained by RTD’s document control process managed
by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety and Environmental
Division maintains data and documentation of activities required by the Public Transportation
Agency Safety Plan. Distribution of safety-related reports and data is accomplished through the
RTD Executive Safety and Security Committee. RTD will include data collected from external
agencies such as the SSOA, FTA, and other sources as a part of the analysis process.

III 1.4 System Modifications
New equipment modifications and retrofits are determined, reviewed, and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the Technical Support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5 System Modifications and Configuration Management
System modifications are managed according to Light Rail Standard Operating Procedure 101.11,
Light Rail System Change Procedure. The SOP defines system change as follows: modifications,
alterations, additions, or deletions to the contracts, specifications, components, equipment or
facilities affecting any part of the light rail operating system.
This procedure is intended to assure that any potential hazards that may be introduced through
system modification are addressed through RTD’s hazard management program, and affected
RTD Departments are afforded the opportunity and given due consideration for any proposed
change or modification to the light rail system. System changes are proposed by submitting a
“Proposal for LRT System Change” form. This system change form includes the following
information:






Brief description including support data
Description of benefits expected
Resources required
Operation implications
Safety considerations

Completed forms are forwarded to the initiator’s supervisor, department head, and lastly to the
Executive Safety and Security Committee via the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security
and Asset Management. Upon receipt of the proposed change, the Safety Unit determines if a
preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is necessary. If a PHA is necessary, it is performed by the
Safety Unit. All information is distributed to the Executive Safety and Security Committee for
evaluation based on safety, operational, and cost criteria. The Committee must reach consensus
for the proposal to be accepted. Recommended proposals are forwarded to the Assistant General

1.C.4.b

Documentation is accomplished by tracking the system change form and keeping a log of
proposed changes with notes and final action disposition. The scope of this section applies to the
light rail system.
Configuration management is managed in a similar fashion. Authority to make configuration
changes lies with the consensus of the Executive Safety and Security Committee. The process for
making configuration changes is controlled by the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
Specific members of the Executive Safety and Security Committee participate in the design
review and acceptance of modifications, new equipment and facilities, and system expansion. In
managing this process through the Executive Safety and Security Committee, all departments are
assured the opportunity to review and provide input. Design is further controlled by RTD’s Light
Rail Design Criteria. Any deviation from the design criteria must be approved by the Executive
Safety and Security Committee. The formal safety certification process is applied to system
expansions and new systems. Refer to safety certification section for additional information.

III 1.5.1
Resolution

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the hazard management
program process as described in sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, and 3.3.4. This process is administered by
the Safety and Environmental Division and performed jointly by the Engineering Division, the
Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental Division. New equipment,
system expansions, and modifications are ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 1.5.2

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the
Engineering Division, the Light Rail Operations Division, and the Safety and Environmental
Division. This review is conducted to assure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications
safely and operationally integrate into the existing system.

III 1.5.3
Acceptance

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification

Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Light Rail Operations Division
performs rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the Vehicle and Equipment
Acceptance process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the
Light Rail Operations Division. This information is presented and approved by the Safety
Certification Program and described in section 3.3.13. The Safety and Security Certification
Program provides an identification, design, review and verification process for system expansions
and modifications. Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Chairman of
the Executive Safety and Security Committee.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

Manager of Rail Operations for final signature approval. A review schedule is followed to ensure
proposals are evaluated in a timely manner. The Executive Safety and Security Committee meets
monthly to address proposals and other light rail safety and security issues.

1.C.4.b

Exceptions to Established Design Criteria

Exceptions to RTD’s Light Rail Design Criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the
Executive Safety and Security Committee. If appropriate, the Design Criteria may be amended or
modified to accommodate acceptable modifications. The Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the light rail design criteria.

III 1.5.5

Procurement Procedures

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements such as light rail construction
related projects or procurement of light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop detailed specifications through
the design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of
design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee. In addition to procurement specifications, the Safety
and Security Certification Review Process described in Section 3.3.13 governs light rail
construction. This procurement procedure in combination with the system modification
procedure, established design criteria, and hazard communication program precludes the
introduction of unauthorized hazardous materials and supplies as well as defective or deficient
equipment into the District’s Transit Systems.

III 1.5.6

System Modifications

New equipment modifications and retrofits are determined, reviewed, and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the Technical Support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

III 2 Management of Change
Configuration control within RTD will be managed through the Configuration Control
Committee once formalized (CCC, name not final) process during design and construction, and
the management of change (MOC) process during operations. The CCC process is managed for
RTD by Capital Development. The MOC process is managed by the Safety and Security Review
Committee (SSRC) chaired by the chief safety officer.
Configuration management within RTD consists of the Configuration Control Committee (CCC)
process during design and construction, and the management of change (MOC) process during
operations.
The CCC process is managed for RTD by Capital Development, and coordinates new systems or
extensions before they are implemented in the existing operating environment. Project managers
use the Project Management Plan (PMP) to guide capital projects. In addition to the Project
Management Plan (PMP) the Project Control Specialist will implement guidance from the Project
Control User Manual. This manual is updated periodically and contains direction for as built and
document control procedures. Specific guidance for document control procedures, File Creation
(4.2), File codes, SIRE use (4.2), is provided in The Project Control User Manual Section 4.0.
Smaller projects may include an abbreviated PMP specific to the project.
Representatives from each involved department and safety are represented in the CCC process.
Project changes to existing structures or facilities is critical that effected RTD personnel, public,
or other effected groups be notified of the change which might have potential safety or security
impacts. Effected personnel are invited to participate in project meetings and coordinate any
changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance procedures, bulletins
or SOP’s may need to be developed. General public may be effected. The Public Relations
Department personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or effected groups. There
is an essential element of communications that must take place after the project is completed and
being used. Any observed negative or hazardous impacts of a change must be reported to
management personnel as soon as possible.

III 2.1 Safety and Security Certification
System Safety personnel develop and implement Safety and Security Certification Programs to
assure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation of rail
passenger operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, modification or
replacement of equipment. RTD utilizes the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and Security
Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification program. An
individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. For minor
extensions, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of safety and
security certification forms applicable to the scope of work. Modifications are managed through
the light rail modification process. Regarding new equipment, if it is procured as part of a new

1.C.4.b

Packet Pg. 140

maintenance facility, the equipment is included in the certification program for the facility. Rail
vehicles undergo a formalized acceptance program under the supervision of rail operations. The
Safety and Security Certification Program has the following goals: verify that acceptable safety
and security levels are met or exceeded; document the verification of safety and security
standards; and provide consistency for project certification. With these goals in mind, the
objectives of the Program can be more narrowly defined. Objectives of the Program include:
identify and verify safety and security requirements of the system design; identify and verify
safety and security requirements for construction and system equipment installation; identify and
verify safety and security requirements are met or exceeded for system testing; and identify and
verify safety and security requirements are met for changes or modifications to standard operating
procedures, training manuals, rule book, and system elements. Under the direction of the RTD
Chief Safety Officer, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the
Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental and the FasTracks System Safety Project Manager
are responsible for the management of the Program. The Executive Safety and Security
Committee, chaired by the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset
Management, oversee the process.

III 2.2 Quality Assurance
Large projects at RTD have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the
design and construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In
general, QA/QC activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to
review by the FTA and others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the
contractor, and submitted in his quality plan prior to initiation of construction. RTD retains
qualified inspectors and testing firms to provide Quality Assurance by document submittal
reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout the project.
Received goods are compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other certifications as required
on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel assure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing
personnel or safety compliance officers will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices,
and other devices for compliance with specifications. Items will also be periodically functionally
tested to assure they meet standards.

III 3 Rules Compliance
III 3.1 Reports and Data Analysis
In the future results of the operational tests are compiled and reviewed quarterly by the Manager
of Rail Operations or a designated supervisor(s) and the Safety Manager. A written form of the
discussion and review will be provided to the Safety Department within 30 days after the end of
the quarter. An annual report is completed by a designated supervisor(s) summarizing the
previous year’s results of the operational tests. The annual report is turned over to the Safety
Department for further review and trend analysis. See SOP 109.23 Operational Rule Compliance
Testing.

III 3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the corporate positive people management process (PPM)
which includes: coaching, retraining, and, formal discipline (performance agreement and
termination) that may result in termination. See RTD Corporate Policy 6.3.1. Rail operations
maintains a log for all stop indications and wrong route violations, and may further investigate
any rules violation that is reported, or that may be part of an accident or incident. Additionally, all
accidents and incidents are reviewed by supervisors and the safety administrator to determine if
rules have been violated, or if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary.

III 3.1.2

Hazard Management

The safety compliance officer may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or
procedure into the hazard management program for resolution. Hazards unresolved by the Rail
Safety Committee (RSC) are directed to the SSRC committee for further tracking, review,
resolution, and or correction. Non-compliant review findings determined to be hazardous are
documented in the hazard log. A date of observation, description of the hazardous condition,
corrective action required, and implementation date are tracked until the hazardous condition is
corrected. See the Hazard Management Program portion of the PTASP for further information.
The Safety Administrator conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to determine
the effectiveness of the rule compliance program. Rail Service and the Rail Safety Committee
review rules and procedures regularly to determine if changes, revisions, or additions are
necessary.

III 3.2 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

Adopted Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Employee Rule Book strictly govern
light rail operations. The SOP manual is comprehensive with procedures for every aspect of light
rail operation including: administration, communication, operations- normal, operations-

Packet Pg. 142

abnormal, safety, and signals/switches. SOPs are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary
according to the following guidelines: prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new
corridor; prior to opening a new rail maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal
safety review process. A committee consisting of Light Rail Controller/Supervisors, Operators,
and the Light Rail Safety Compliance Officer performs review. Recommended SOP changes are
reviewed and approved by the Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations and then sent for
review and approval by the Executive Safety and Security Committee.
The Employee Rule Book contains the body of RTD’s light rail operating rules. It has been
designed to meet the following three purposes to ensure the safe operation of the system.
 To identify RTD’s operating practices and standards;
 To aid in the instruction of these practices; and
 To serve employees as a reference manual whenever questions rise on the safest course of
action.
The Rule Book contains the General Manager’s Statement, instructions for use, types of operating
regulations, and the operations policy statement. Rules are segregated by the following
categories: safety rules, general rules, train operating rules, and standard operating procedures.
The Rule Book is printed in a portable format for ease of reference. Similar to the SOPs, the Rule
Book is periodically reviewed and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines:
prior to revenue service of a system expansion or new corridor; prior to opening a new rail
maintenance facility; or as recommended by the internal safety review process.

III 3.3 Emergency and Contingency Planning
The RTD outlines emergency and contingency plans in the Light Rail Emergency Response Plan.
The purpose of this program is to provide direction on roles and responsibilities to RTD and
emergency response personnel in the case of an emergency situation, which adversely affects
operations. There is a training component to familiarize Denver metropolitan area emergency
response agency personnel with safety features and operating characteristics of RTD’s Light Rail
Transit system.
Included in the program are brief descriptions of system elements and illustrations that depict
these elements.
The objectives of this program are threefold:





Generate common knowledge among personnel in emergency response agencies, such as
police and fire departments as well as paramedic units, to enhance their interaction with
RTD personnel when required;
Minimize potential danger to passengers during incidents, emergency or otherwise, that
requires response from agencies external to RTD; and
Maximize the effectiveness of responding personnel dealing with emergency situations
by increasing their overall knowledge of unique elements within the respective
communities.
Implement after action findings as required

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

Planning, updates, and drills are discussed in the emergency plans. Documentation of drills is
tracked either through specific files for each drill or the Executive Safety and Security
83
Packet Pg. 143

Committee. The light rail emergency plan is reviewed and updated if necessary according to the
following criteria: following an emergency incident to review and critique operations if requested
by a Fire Life Safety Committee Member, upon change or modification to the light rail system
requiring changes to this plan, upon the request of any Fire Life Safety Committee Member, or at
least annually to review/revise the plan and arrange for periodic drills and possible refresher
training. Emergency drills are documented in the plan. After action reports will be completed for
all exercises and managed incidents.
Emergency response procedures (internal RTD standard operating procedures) are reviewed and
revised as necessary and distributed to RTD personnel accordingly. Additional information
regarding emergency management is included in Section I 6.1.

III 3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus Operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the “Trailblazer”.
Standard rules of conduct and procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have
been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations and are considered necessary for
rendering a quality level of service to customers. The “Trailblazer” is comprehensive manual with
procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations including: the performance code;
passenger relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating
procedures; emergency and legal procedures; equipment care and operation; personal appearance;
radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures; routes maps and diagrams;
maintenance tips; fleet data; and street guides.
Service Planning/Scheduling updates the “Trailblazer” on an as-needed basis. Transportation
bulletins are a common practice that addresses day to day issues.

III 3.4.1
Book

Review of Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule

The Safety personnel review Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), the Trailblazer, and the
Employee Rule Book as necessary. These reviews are conducted when system monitoring and
data analysis imply that either the SOPs or rules are not as effective as possible, or when change
or expansion to operations occurs. Review also occurs during the RTD internal safety review
process. Recommendations for any policy or rule change are presented to the Executive Safety
and Security Committee for approval.

III 4 Facilities, Structures and Equipment Inspections
RTD's bus and rail facilities and equipment will be inspected on a regular basis according to
company policies and SOPs, equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as
required by local, state, and federal regulations.
Rail Facilities Maintenance employees utilize a “Facilities Maintenance Plan”. Assignments are
made to individual maintenance employees to ensure the purpose and scope of the plan is
fulfilled.

III 4.1 Facilities and Equipment to Be Inspected
Operating facilities and equipment routinely inspected and tested by employees, supervisors,
management, and safety and environmental personnel include the following:
 Bus and rail maintenance/support shops/administrative offices, and equipment within the
shops
 Fire system equipment
 Safety eyewash and shower systems
 Floor and portable hoist systems and cranes
 Heating, air conditioning, lighting, and ventilation systems
 Hydraulic presses, grinders, welders, wheel-truing equipment, lathes, etc.
 Hazardous materials handling and storage, etc.
 Locomotives, cab-cars, passenger cars, light rail vehicles, and buses
 Support equipment (i.e. rolling stock) including high-rail vehicles, track maintenance
vehicles, bucket trucks, loaders, forklifts, aerial lifts, etc.
 Infrastructure including rail station platforms, track, switches, OCS, bridges, gradecrossing equipment, etc.

III 4.2 Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures
Preventative maintenance inspection schedules are generated through the computer system per
equipment manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations, and as required by local, state, and
federal regulations. A maintenance supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections and assigns
the work out to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists (Exhibits E) to identify
potential physical hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts, and policy and procedural deficiencies
with the facility or equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are
returned to the supervisor for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection
and repair records to confirm the inspection process.

1.C.4.b

M.O.W. (Line, Signal and Rail Maintenance) Standards and
procedures

Line and Signal uses a maintenance of way plan “MOW Procedures” that outlines specific testing
and maintenance procedures in accordance with FRA regulations. These are in accordance 49
CFR parts 233 - 236.
Right of way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan “rail maintenance standards” to maintain
the track in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR part 213. The standard outlines all aspects
of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

III 4.3

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

The majority of safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees, and
supervisors, and require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive
immediate attention are forwarded to the appropriate supervision and will be reported to the
safety administrator or safety committee. An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be
corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the hazard log for tracking purposes and
managed by the SSRC committee. A corrective action plan, responsible person, and completion
date will be assigned. Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

III 4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management and Inspection Program

The railroad Bridge Safety Management Program (BSMP) has been developed and implemented
by RTD to minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges carrying RTD
traffic, to safeguard their ability to carry RTD traffic, and to minimize risk of human casualties.

III 5 System Safety Inspections and Reviews
The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections and reviews. Maintenance facilities are
inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations and local fire codes.
Semiannual reviews are conducted in conjunction with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
to document compliance with established standard operating procedures, maintenance plans and
the System Safety and System Security Program Plan. Any deviations from required activities or
identified safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process. For additional
information on system safety reviews, refer to section 5.3.

III 5.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews of the light rail system are conducted semiannually in
conjunction with the PUC to assure compliance with the Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for
occupational safety issues and local fire codes. The overall light rail system is reviewed to assure
that activities required by RTD’s operating, maintenance, and Public Transportation Agency
Safety Plan are completed. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed to the
reviewed parties. The Executive Safety and Security Committee may also discuss review
findings, evaluate the effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, recommend

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

III 4.2.1

86
Packet Pg. 146

corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An annual
internal light rail review report is compiled in January of each year and submitted to the PUC by
February 15 of each year. The report documents the review findings for the year including the
results of the internal reviews performed during the previous year, a summary of required
corrective actions taken, if any, and provision for follow up to ensure timely implementation and
to determine effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. The annual report
will be accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the General Manager indicating
that the RTD is in compliance with its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan and system
security plan. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the General Manager, by letter, will identify
the activities RTD will take to achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are
maintained in the Safety and Environmental Division. The Safety Unit and the PUC have
developed a review program to gain efficiency and maximize resource utilization.
As part of the internal review program, all RTD departments are subject to review under the
direction of the Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, the Senior
Manager of Safety and Environmental is responsible for and has complete authority to conduct
internal safety reviews. Two reviews are conducted each year, one in the spring and one in the
fall. Within a three-year period, all Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan elements are
reviewed for compliance with the plan and state safety oversight requirements. The sixth review
cycle is usually reserved to review the review process to assure that all elements are completed
and that the review program meets the state safety oversight requirements.
RTD will notify the PUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
review. The internal review team consists of representatives from the Safety Unit of RTD. Each
checklist is assigned a lead reviewer for the final development of the checklist and to be the
responsible person to complete the checklist including back up documentation when the review is
complete. When a review element under the administration of the Safety and Environmental
Division is conducted, PUC staff serves as the lead reviewer to assure an independent review
process. Written checklists are developed by the lead reviewer.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to review and the review
team. In some cases an opening conference is not required. At the opening conference, the
checklists are distributed and each checklist is discussed and reviewed for accuracy. The review
schedule is then set with the affected departments. The actual review consists of interviews with
key personnel, documentation review, and observation of activities to assess compliance and
understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion of the onsite review activities,
the checklists are completed and a written draft report is developed. The draft report may include
recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to make
improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment
to the reviewed parties. Reviewed parties have 30 days to respond to the draft report including an
opportunity to correct any findings. A final report is completed and distributed to the reviewed
parties. Recorded findings require the development of a corrective action plan. Each year, the
annual review report prepared and submitted to the PUC, will include an evaluation of the
adequacy and effectiveness of the new Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

Recommendation and findings will be tracked in two ways. Recommendations from previous
review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent review cycles. Findings will be

87
Packet Pg. 147

1.C.4.b

tracked under the corrective action plan process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet
and the subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports filed with the PUC.

5.2

Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment and facilities is performed by the RTD in
accordance with manufacturer’s manuals, codes, standards and established procedures.
Maintenance is performed at a level of readiness that ensures safe, efficient and reliable mass
transit. RTD maintains data to track scheduled maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment that are involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason
to suspect equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident or if a fatality is involved.
Vehicles or equipment are returned to service only after it is determined that there are no defects
that could have contributed to the accident. The light rail maintenance crew has an established
strategic plan to ensure rapid deployment, recovery and return to service in the event of an
emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient light rail operations.
The LRT Maintenance Department has standards that make safety and reliability the primary
objectives of the system. These goals are met by the incorporation of preventive and repair
maintenance programs for all aspects of the rail system. These systems include: traction
electrification (substation and overhead wire), signals, trackway, rail vehicles, and support
equipment such as shop equipment, non-revenue vehicles, and facilities (shop, passenger stations,
park-n-rides, right-of-way). The foundation of the rail maintenance documentation material is the
Rail Maintenance Plan. A well-developed plan ensures: 1) a high degree of continuity and
consistency in routine maintenance activities, 2) a structured process for improving the
productivity and efficiency of Rail Maintenance functions, and 3) a fulfillment of FTA’s Section
9 requirements.
The Rail Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas: 1) Preventive maintenance programs
will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures. 2) Changes in preventive maintenance
programs may be expected periodically as experience is gained on the equipment maintained. 3)
Preventive maintenance goals and polices will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress. 4) Effective maintenance procedures require much
record keeping and information storage/retrieval. 5) The technical sophistication of the LRV, the
tracking of a large, expensive inventory and the scale of the physical plant, place a heavy
responsibility on the information capabilities of the Rail Maintenance Department.
The maintenance philosophy for LRT is to incorporate a mix of in-house and contracted
maintenance activities so that the system is safely and efficiently maintained. This type of
philosophy has successfully been implemented in other transit properties. The maintenance
philosophy also utilizes existing RTD transit operations, and in many instances will share
organizational services, personnel, and equipment.

III 6 Drug and Alcohol Program and Medical Monitoring
6.1

Drug and Alcohol Program

The RTD maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with U.S. Department
of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration regulations and to ensure the safe operation
and maintenance of systems and equipment. The program includes criteria for random testing of
safety sensitive personnel and testing for cause either accident related or from observed behavior.
The RTD Finance and Administration Department manages this program. The program is subject
to frequent review by the FTA. To date, the program has been found exemplary by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Policy. The program is administered by RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Coordinator
which includes verification of compliance with the program and training. Training is given to all
employees during orientation training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees.
If necessary, follow-up training is provided.
Compliance and knowledge of the program is accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.

GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work
environment for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree
90
Packet Pg. 150

that employees of the system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment.
At the same time, every effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all
employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the
public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to
restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and
drug testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an
effective employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights
and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implement this policy to
1. Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing;
2. Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol
problems;
3. Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and
discipline; and
4. Enforce RTD’s goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate
discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be
aware of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of
intervening when a substance abuse problem is suspected. Exhibits A to this policy contains
additional discussion of these matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 1998, July
2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many elements of this policy are required by
federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this
policy are not required by federal regulations but are official RTD policy.
Exhibits B to this policy explains which elements of this policy are not federally required.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact RTD’s
Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended
or revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be
familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All
existing and new RTD employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and
the signs and symptoms which may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD’s drug and alcohol testing program,
is a required condition of employment.

APPLICABILITY
III 6.2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property
of RTD to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and
vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safety
sensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as
amended and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special
requirements set forth in this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an
employee is performing, ready to perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to
the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
 Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service.
 Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.
 Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.
 Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
CDL.
 Carrying a firearm for security purposes.
 Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items a-e above.
RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to
determine which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job
functions may require the performance of safety-sensitive corporate policies.

III 6.3

Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification and
Performance Testing

RTD employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to
job classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are
rail and bus operators, and rail and bus maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below.
However, each training and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training, and
written exams. Certification documentation, including tests and test scores, are maintained in
employee files and are subject to review during the RTD internal safety review program.
Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The ontrack safety training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to
work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format
allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified
through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards. The Safety and
Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the program.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

III 6.2

92
Packet Pg. 152

Regarding performance testing, any operating or maintenance rule is subject to verification and
compliance. Compliance with rules, training and certification requirements is verified in several
ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field by supervisors and safety unit
personnel. If supervisors observe an issue, they discuss it with the operator as soon as practical. In
addition to this on-going monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal
ride checks in which supervisors, usually anonymously or covertly, observe bus and rail operators
according to a predetermined criteria or check list. These ride checks are documented, reviewed
with the operator and maintained in the operator’s employee file. These records are subject to
verification during the RTD internal safety review process. If a trend or issue is discovered during
system monitoring, observation and ride checks, they are reported to the RTD Executive Safety
and Security Committee for inclusion into the RTD hazard management program.
Bus, rail and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision including observation and
verification of their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is
reviewed and approved for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order
process. When a maintainer completes their work assignment, their direct supervisor verifies and
approves the work through observation and signature approval on the work order. In late 2007,
this process was automated in the new enterprise system. The maintainer will enter in the system
that the work is complete, the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, and then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also
observed during the RTD internal safety review process. Supervision is also assessed during the
RTD internal safety review program by the review of documentation and compliance with
schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in the
review report. Review findings are referred to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
for inclusion in RTD’s hazard management program.

specific training classes. The training includes the Rail System Safety Course presented by the
Transportation Safety Institute and other courses covering occupational safety.
Personnel outside the safety unit may receive the Rail System Safety Course and attend APTA
seminars. System safety personnel conduct in-house training for RTD personnel regarding safety
certification, hazard analysis, and construction safety.

III 6.4

Procurement

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by RTD’s Procurement Standards Manual.
Each procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the
requesting manager. Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the
scope of the procurement. As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review.
Minor procurements require authorization from the Contracts and Procurement Division and the
Division Manager of the requesting division. Major procurements, such as light rail construction
related projects or procurement of light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Engineering Division and Technical Support Staff develop detailed specifications through
the design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of
design, peer reviews by personnel from other transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the
Executive Safety and Security Committee.

IV PROMOTION
Pillar IV of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is Safety Promotion. This section
describes the responsibilities of staff to the safety program, and encouragement of others to
follow established policies. It describes the committee structure established to form the means of
discussing, solving and if necessary elevating safety issues and concerns to resolution. Training
and certifications to enhance the qualifications and competencies of RTD staff are described,
along with the reoccurring activities at RTD designed to promote and remind all employees about
safety in the organization.

IV 1.1

PTASP Implementation Activities and
Responsibilities

PTASP Committees and Position Responsibilities

RTD implements the PTASP through a series of committees and department positions who have
responsibility for specific areas, yet work in a coordinated manner to ensure the safety of the
authority. As related in section 3.2, safety is a key responsibility of all managers at RTD. All
employees have the right to present safety concerns to their immediate supervisor, manager, or
safety compliance officers. Any employee, supervisor, or
manager that brings an
incident, accident, safety concern, or hazard, in good faith will not be adversely affected, or be
subjected to harassment or intimidation. These retaliations are not tolerated by RTD.

IV 1.2

PTASP Committees

RTD implements the PTASP collaboratively through a series of committees coordinating bus and
rail operation and maintenance services. Concerns, if not resolved by the manager or supervisor,
will be referred to and addressed by the respective safety committee. The following hierarchy of
committees at RTD are established to address all safety issues.

IV 1.2.1
(ESSC)

General Managers Executive Safety and Security Committee

The ESSC is RTD's highest level safety committee, chaired by the General Manager. The
committee is alternately chaired by the Chief Safety Officer. The ESSC is comprised of members
of the RTD corporate staff, which includes representation from the executive level, and the rail,
and bus, and facilities business unit general managers, and the Safety, Security, and Asset
Management Department.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

Packet Pg. 157

The ESSC reviews and approves safety policies, goals, and objectives. It coordinates the support
and resources needed to maintain high safety standards for all aspects of service and system
safety. The general manager (GM), through the ESSC, is the ultimate authority for safety
certification, system modification, and configuration management. This authority includes
approving each project's safety and security certification statement.
The ESSC committee meets quarterly monthly to review reports on safety, accident trends, major
accidents, urgent/safety critical concerns or hazards, internal/external review findings,
certification recommendations, items referred from the SSRC, and other items of concern to the
ESSC for comment, direction, resolution, and execution. Minutes are maintained and
disseminated to members of the committee.

IV 1.2.3

Management of Change (MOC) Teams

Configuration management within RTD consists of the CCC process during design and
construction, and of the management of change (MOC) process during operations. The MOC
process is more extensively examined in section III 3 of this PTASP.
This process is controlled by the SSRC during operations. As part of this process MOC teams are
assigned to resolve and implement corrective action plans (CAPs) to improve the system or
correct an identified hazard. CAPs are developed by the respective safety committees (RSC,
BSC) and approved by the SSRC. Responsible staff to lead the MOC team are recommended by
the safety committee and approved by the SSRC.
MOC process applies to existing bus and rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment
that may not require formal safety certification but which may have safety impacts.

IV 1.2.4

Bus Safety Committee (BSC)

The bus safety committees coordinate on-going safety efforts within the Transportation,
Facilities, and Maintenance departments of the bus system. They meet monthly to update and
mitigate hazards within their facilities, and on their Systems. Committees are formed for the
District Shops, Platte and Treasury, East Metro, and Boulder Divisions. The BSC committees are
chaired by the Safety Division’s delegate, usually a Safety Compliance Officer. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the Division, and an employee(s) from the following areas:
bus operators, bus maintenance workers, facilities maintenance workers (to include Service and
Cleaning), Health and Wellness, RTD Security, and any other unique area (i.e. – Treasury). The
union (ATU) appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes will be maintained and distributed
to the members of the BSC, the Transportation Managers, and posted to the local Safety Board in
the division, and be made available to others.

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

1.C.4.b

The BSC minutes will contain an open item log listing issues brought forward at BSC meetings,
submitted through the Hazard Management System, and the Safety Suggestion Boxes posted at
each Division. The log will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the
committee, an initial hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code), and the estimated month/year the
corrective action will be complete. There will also be a log of closed/completed items, as well as
98
Packet Pg. 158

informational items for RTD employees. This log will be posted at each Division for all
employees to view. Most safety issues will be resolved within the parameters of the BSC. Issues
not resolved in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
BSC actions will include the following:
 Reviews facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff,
reviews, or inspections
 Assigns responsibility for correcting hazards
 Reviews open items for completion
 Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (FTA, PUC)

IV 1.2.5

Rail Safety Committee (RSC)

The rail safety committees (RSC) coordinate on-going safety efforts within the operations and
maintenance services of the rail system. They meet monthly to update and mitigate hazards in
their facilities and on their systems. A committee is formed for light rail. The committees consist
of the Operations manager, two representatives (one Union rep, one admin rep) from operations,
LRV maintenance , Facility Maintenance, Maintenance of Way and the safety compliance
officer-rail, who serves as a technical advisor and Chair to the committee. The corresponding
maintenance facilities (Elati, Rio Court, and Mariposa) are represented respectively on their RSC.
The union appoints bargaining unit employees to the RSC annually to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department, voicing safety concerns to the RSC.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the RSC
committee through an open communication process. Minutes of discussion and action will be
maintained and distributed to the members of the RSC, and be available to others.
The RSC will maintain a local hazard log listing issues, corrective actions, and close-out dates.
The log will include the date entered and the responsible party to correct the action. Most safety
issues will be resolved within the parameters of the RSC. Issues not resolved in the RSC, or
safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSRC.
RSC actions are similar to those listed under the BSC above. Additionally the RSC examines
compliance with General Code of Operating Rules (GCOR), (FRA 49 CFR Part 214, 49 CFR
200-399; FTA 49 CFR 659).

IV 1.2.6

Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC)

The Fire and Life Safety and Committee serves as a liaison between project safety and local
police, fire and emergency response agencies. The FLSSC is chaired by the System Safety
Engineer. Members include local police, fire, and EMS staff, and RTD's public safety, bus
operations, and rail supervisors.
The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance in the system. Drills are initiated during the
activation phase, and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an
effective inter-agency rapport.

IV 1.2.7

Configuration Control Committee (CCC)

The Configuration Control committee (CCC) has been established as a management tool to assist
in evaluating recommended changes to a particular project and providing final approval for
configuration and budget changes. The CCC’s function is to address the need for continuity
through the entire life of the project. It is essential that changes to the project be communicated
through the proper channels and that all necessary personnel have been notified. More
importantly, the function is to monitor, evaluate, recommend and carry out any changes in the
scope of the project through all project stages.

IV 1.2.8
/ (FAC)

Activation Committee (AC) / Rail (RAC) / Bus (BAC) / Facility

The Activation Committee is a working committee of managers that meets regularly, combining
safety and security verification process functions into RTD's construction, systems integration,
and testing phases of new rail projects. The RAC is made up of an activation manager (RAM) and
one manager from each of the following four supporting disciplines: Safety, Civil, Systems and
Operations.
RTD has instituted the use of the Activation Committee and the Hold Point process to bring on
new bus and facility projects. The membership of the committee may change slightly to best fit
the role of the RAC, BAC or FAC. The remainder of this section describes the Rail project
process, but is readily adaptable to a bus or facility project.
Each discipline manager will be responsible for ensuring all certified items lists (CILs),
procedures, tests, filing of documents, and any other assigned activities for his/her group are

completed in accordance with applicable parts of the rail activation plan (RAP). Three of the four
discipline managers, identified above, will each be assigned coordination responsibilities for one
of the three rail activation primary functions-safety and security certification, system integration
testing, and rail services. The RAC will oversee and approve all rail activation documents and
activities.
The RAM, with help from the RAC, will ensure that the project follows the rail activation
process, that all documents are properly completed and filed correctly, and that all necessary
safety and security certifications are properly completed and signed before the project enters
revenue service.
The RAC will meet regularly to develop and finalize details of the RAP specific to the project,
and then manage rail activation activities against the plan. They will also discuss progress, issues,
and concerns in regard to activation activities and requirements. Meeting minutes will be
recorded and filed each time the committee meets. An action items list will be included with the
minutes, and will be updated and discussed each time the committee meets to ensure
responsibility and completion of items deemed critical to successful rail activation. The
committee will create, maintain, and adhere to a rail activation-specific schedule, which will help
to ensure completion of activation and start-up activities prior to scheduled revenue service dates.
Following commencement of revenue operations, the RAC provides "lessons learned" input to
planning and design teams, and for improved processes for the next activation.

IV 1.2.9

Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG)

The Safety and Security Working Group (SSWG) is established by the Project Manager (PM) for
each project that significantly changes the interaction of employees or patrons with the RTD
system. The SSWG examines the design and specifications of safety and security critical systems
on the project. The SSWG is chaired by the PM, project director, or a designee. Primary
responsibilities of the SSWG are to establish the preliminary hazard analysis, focus on and
mitigate hazards on the project, and coordinate the project safety elements through design,
construction and activation. The threat and vulnerability assessment (TVA), if conducted, is also
coordinated by the SSWG.
The SSWG begins during the design phase and conducts regular review meetings, separate from
ongoing design efforts, to focus specifically on safety issues. The project manager ensures that
safety considerations are continually considered during regular design reviews. Design
modifications that are recommended to be incorporated into the RTD design criteria are referred
to the Capital Development civil design manager for review at the design and construction
meeting (DCM). Modifications are then forwarded to the Configuration Control Committee
(CCC) for approval if the modifications are significant enough.

Intent – to review systems from an end-user perspective, looking for hazards that can be 1)
engineered out of the system, 2) corrected with SOP, procedures, etc. or 3) addressed with PPE.
The SSWG may not change the scope of the project, but may make decisions that relate directly
to the remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the
scope phase of the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job specific CILS and creates and maintains the PHA. If the SSWG
determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below Medium, then the SSWG
presents its findings to the SSRC for final risk analysis.

IV 1.2.10

Accident Investigation Team (AIT)

The AIT will is comprised of key RTD staff from varying department that would have a role in
the development of a Corrective Action plan resulting in RTD involved accidents. PUC will also
be an invited member to all AEG meetings and play an active role in identifying casual or
contributing factors.

IV 1.2.11

Department Position Responsibilities

All employees have the right and responsibility to address safety in their work area, and on the
system, and to present safety concerns to their immediate supervisor, manager, or safety
compliance officers. The Manager coordinates with safety committees and Safety Department to
ensure that hazards are quickly and effectively eliminated. Specific departments and positions
within RTD have inherent safety responsibilities. Those departments, illustrated in the RTD
Safety Organization chart, and positions are addressed in the following matrix and sections.

Safety Assurance Practices
Employee Roles and Responsibilities

RTD employees and contractor personnel, whether construction or service contractors, are
required to be in compliance with applicable RTD rules and standard operating procedures (SOP)
as well as local, state, and federal safety regulations. Service contractors who perform specific
jobs under contract are required to be in compliance with specific safety or environmental laws
that are or may be affected by their work.
RTD has developed the RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit
that governs contractor safety specifically for contracted construction workers for RTD. This
manual outlines procedures and responsibilities of RTD project managers and contractor
personnel who contract with RTD to perform construction work activities. Additionally, the RTD
safety goal is to achieve accident-free construction projects.
The RTD FasTracks Construction Safety Guidelines for Light Rail Transit reflect minimal
standards. All general contractors, contractors, and their sub-tiers will be expected to meet or
exceed the standards and good safe practices outlined in the manual and their own safety
program, whichever is more stringent.
The RTD grants and contract administrator will review and implement into contract language
requirements for the contract employees to meet. These contracts are written and reviewed by
RTD's Office of General Counsel and Safety and Environmental Divisions, as well as the contract
administrator to assure that specific safety and environmental requirements for contract
employees are met.

IV 2.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

RTD is a public employer within the State of Colorado. As such, RTD is not subject to
enforcement under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, it is the
District’s policy to voluntarily comply with OSHA regulations. To that end, the Safety Division
develops safety policies and procedures for occupational safety in compliance with OSHA
guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected employees based on job hazard
analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high hazard areas such as confined spaces and
lockout/tagout (LOTO). Safety staff conducts training. In addition to safety policies, the
environmental unit develops policies for environmental compliance. All RTD employees and
contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10' of centerline of
track), must receive the OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible to train
their employees on OSHA-Required training prior to performing RTD projects. Other related
training that contract employees and RTD employees will be current on includes the following:
•
Hazard communication
•
Blood-borne pathogen awareness

Attachment: 2018 PTASP Final (3636 : Presentation of the RTD Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan)

All RTD personnel will receive training to become familiar with Safety Management Systems.
The training will include:

FRA has defined safety related employees as: train operators, signal system maintainers, and train
controllers
These specific work positions, whether they are held by RTD employees or contractors
functioning for RTD Rail Services, may be regulated by 49 CFR 228. Other FRA regulatory
requirements, including the following, must be met by employees and contract personnel as it is
required by their function.
•
Maintaining and accessing employee and contractor training records
•
Compliance with training and certification requirements
Employees and contractors, who are under a legal contract with RTD, are obligated to comply
with specific safety and environmental requirements and demonstrate quality of workmanship by
observation and records reviews. Employees and/or contract employees will meet the training,
inspections, testing, and maintenance specifications as outlined in 49 CFR, as it relates to
commuter rail vehicle maintenance and personnel training. RTD supervisors, managers, and
safety compliance officers are authorized to make regular observations of work being performed,
and will determine whether or not safety and environmental requirements are being complied
with. The quality of materials and construction processes will also be reviewed by designated
quality assurance personnel. Training courses given to employees and contractors will require
that tests be completed prior to the completion of coursework. These will be the primary methods
used to assure that compliance is obtained.
RTD will identify the tasks related to the inspection, testing, and maintenance required by Part
238 that must be performed on each type of equipment that RTD LRV operates.

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

Except for the RTD on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near
RTD rail property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The
On-Track Safety Training (OTST) program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an
access permit to work near or on RTD rail property. The program is usually instructed in a trainthe-trainer format allowing contractors to train their own personnel. Compliance with this
program is verified through in-field observation and examination of contractor’s training cards.
The Safety and Environmental Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the
program.
All contractor work on or near RTD rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing
an access permit, the contractor is required to meet with RTD staff to describe and coordinate
their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit which is reviewed
and approved by light rail maintenance-of-way, light rail transportation and safety prior to
signature issue by light rail control. The contractor is bound to the requirements of the permit. All
contractors contracted with RTD are also bound by contract specifications for the work they are
to perform.
The Safety and Environmental Division has developed two documents for the management of
construction safety; the Construction Safety Guidelines, and the Safety and Security Certification
Plan. The Construction Safety Guidelines presents guidelines and requirements for RTD
construction projects and generally follows OSHA construction requirements. Contractors are
required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of RTD contract
specifications and access permits.
RTD safety officers conduct construction safety oversight to monitor contractor work place safety
and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety orientation prior to
project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety meetings are
conducted between RTD and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction
verification. The Plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection
documentation, equipment testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

IV 2.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by RTD safety compliance officers.
This program defines construction safety functions and responsibilities and other construction
safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation, and safety personnel. All
contractors and RTD employees must comply with Occupation Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) rules and the requirements of the construction safety program, RTD Rail Services rule
books, SOPs, and individual company contract agreements with RTD.
Contractors who have personnel working around rail systems may be regulated by 49 CFR Part
214, the Roadway Worker Protection Act. Responsive to that requirement, RTD has established a

The RTD construction safety program will be reviewed and updated on a bi-annual (two-year)
basis. The safety administrator–construction will have primary responsibility for this update. The
safety administrator– construction will also be the responsible party for participating in the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA Triennial Reviews 49 CFR 659.27) as they are conducted
each three-year cycle.

IV 2.6

Training and Certification Training, Courses, Education

The Safety Division maintains electronic training records for the following items: blood borne
pathogens, hazardous communications, lockout tag out, blue flag protection and forklift
certification. All safety related courses that are conducted in a classroom environment or through
computer based delivery are also maintained electronically by the Safety Division.
Records for the following training: Train operator certification, Train operator re-certification,
controller certification, controller re-certification, equipment certification, train license (N.S.T.),
lineman’s course, signal certification and basic/advanced track principles are maintained in the
employee training records, in paper form and are available for review. These records are available
directly from the rail department managers. The training supervisor and management review the
training records to determine completion. Most training is done annually, with all operators,
employees, and supervisors being trained in the same month.

IV 2.6.1

Safety Compliance Officers Certification

The Safety Department recognizes the FTA Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) to administer
Transit Safety and Security Program (TSSP) certification for all safety compliance officers at
RTD. All safety compliance officers will complete the TSSP within the first two years of their
safety assignment. This certification involves the successful completion of the Transit Safety and
Security Program Certificate as outlined by TSI training manual. Courses required are:
 Transit Rail/Bus System Safety
 Transit Rail/Bus Incident Investigation
 Transit System Security
 Effectively Managing Transit Emergencies
RTD Safety Compliance officers are TSSP Certified through the Transportation Safety Institute
and are eligible to receive additional safety certification through the World Safety Organization.
Safety related instruction is emphasized through RTD's corporate policies and procedures,
maintained on RTD's intranet.

Occupational, Environmental, Safety and Health (OES&H)

An important aspect of safety compliance falls under Occupational, Environmental, Safety and
Health (OES&H) rules, regulations, guidance, and initiatives. RTD’s safety compliance officers
work closely with managers, supervisors, and employees to ensure understanding of the various
requirements of OES&H, as well as to other federal, state, and local rules, standards, and
ordinances.
Contractors performing work at RTD facilities, who bring chemicals onto RTD property, are
required to participate in a Contractor Environmental Briefing which is presented to the
contractor by the Environmental Compliance Administrator. During this briefing, RTD will
understand what chemicals may be brought onto RTD property and understand the potential for
spills or releases and impact on RTD if the chemicals are not handled according to manufacturer's
recommendations. Copies of Material Safety Data Sheets of chemicals are provided to RTD by
the contractors. Contractors must present their work plan and employee personal protection
procedures for handling chemicals associated with the contracted work at RTD. At the conclusion
of the contractor briefing, the contractor is required to sign the briefing with the Environmental
Compliance Administrator. Contractor personnel who demonstrate a lack of understanding of
applicable rules and procedures may be removed from the work site and require additional safety
training be conducted. Briefing packages are maintained in the Environmental Department files.

IV 3.5

Federal Railroad Administration and Light Rail

RTD’s light rail service (LRV) is one of the few transit agencies in America that is also regulated
by the FRA, in addition to FTA, and PUC SSO agencies. Portions of RTD’s light railroad tracks
share limited freight operations with railroad operators through temporal separation, and as such
come under FRA jurisdiction.
Aspects of RTD’s LRV service are regulated by the FRA. RTD ensures compliance with FRA
regulations, as specified by 49 CFR Parts 213 to 240. RTD has received FRA waivers for a
number of the CFR parts, as defined by a number of waiver agreements.
Joint FRA/FTA policy statements explain how these agencies coordinate their safety authority.
RTD rail safety compliance officers work closely with the FRA to ensure compliance, and to
develop safety initiatives and programs to satisfy regulatory requirements.

IV 3.6

Federal Railroad Administration and Commuter Rail

It is the intent of this Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan to meet all of the applicable FRA
requirements for commuter rail as well as the Light Rail system. This plan will not identify all of
the specific requirements of 49 CFR; however, it will identify the parts that will be regulated by
the FRA. Specific standard operating procedures (SOP) will be developed in each of the
operating areas of maintenance and operations, with the exception of waivers that have been
approved by the FRA for the operation of the Light Rail system. These procedures will identify

Construction Safety

Construction safety is administered in accordance with contract specifications, and applicable
Federal, State and local safety requirements. The RTD System Safety Engineer has primary
responsibility for safety oversight of construction projects. The program is based on, and
complies with applicable federal, state, and local safety codes and regulations. Procedures have
been established for the control of operating hazards, including but not limited to chemicals,
noise, cut and abrasion injuries, strain, and sprain injuries. Contractors are required to comply
with these requirements for the safety of their own employees as well as to safeguard RTD
employees, contractors, passengers and the public.
Engineering and Project Management approves the contractor's safety program plan and
supporting documentation, with the concurrence of the Safety Division. Particular emphasis is
placed on work that may affect RTD operations, passengers, facilities, and personnel. All
contractors working in the RTD rail rights of way, or interfacing with RTD Rail Operations are
required to attend OTST. This training covers track access, right of way flagging, and operating
procedures. Reviews of the contractors are conducted to assure compliance with Federal and State
Law, and the RTD requirements.

IV 3.7.1

Employee and Contractor Awareness of FRA
Requirements

RTD employees and contractors are required to be aware of and comply with specific FRA
regulations. A specific requirement of Roadway Worker Protection (RWP) (49CFR214) is a
safety requirement that employees and contractors must follow. Employees and contractors who
may foul the tracks or have potential to foul the tracks while performing their work are required
to receive specific Roadway Worker Protection training before they perform roadway work. The
rail control centers have established a Work Permit which must be completed and submitted for
approval prior to working on the tracks. Contractors and employees must receive RWP training
and verify competency through testing. Track Access Coordinator reviews and verifies training
requirements prior to approving work permits. Safety personnel and Rail Supervisory personnel
may remove an employee or contractor from a worksite if he/she demonstrates a lack of
knowledge and understanding of applicable RWP rules and procedures. Contracts require
compliance with specific OSHA regulations and employee safety programs as applicable to the

Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations

I.

PURPOSE
The investigation of an incident/accident must produce information that leads to
corrective actions that prevent or reduce the number and severity of future
incident/accidents, if possible. The more complete the information, the easier it will
be to take the proper corrective actions.
For purposes of incident/accident prevention, investigations must be for fact
finding, not fault finding. This is not to imply that responsibility may not be fixed
where human error has caused an incident/accident or that persons should be
excused from the consequences of their actions. Rather, the investigation should be
concerned only with the facts.

II.

DEFINITIONS
Field Investigation Team (FIT) Investigation
The Field Investigation Team !s a group of representatives from Light Rail
Operations, Safety, Claims, and Media Relations. The FIT is activated as required by
the investigating supervisor on the scene. Generally, the Team will be activated to
investigate incident/accidents that are serious in nature; however, personal injury
and extent of damage will not be the sole criteria. Department Managers are
responsible for providing Control with a _current list of representatives for
notification.
The investigating supervisor is responsible for requesting activation of the Team.
Light Rail Central Control is responsible for notification of Team members.
Notification of Team members may be delegated by Central Control to other
operations or safety personnel. The Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
Compliance or designee is responsible for coordination of the investigation. When

forwarded to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental Compliance, who
will submit a final report of the Team's findings to the General Manager, Senior
Management, the Executive Safety and Security Committee, and appropriate
agencies indicating most probable cause, contributing factors, conclusions and
recommendations.
Members of the Field Investigation Team are not to become involved in the

investigation by the Supervisor responding to the scene. The employee in authority
at the scene will:
•

Perform the on-site investigation.

•

Conduct interviews.

•

Gather and collect data.

•

Submit a report to the Controller based on the information collected.

Ill. PROCEDURE
The Controller will dispatch a Light Rail Supervisor immediately to the scene of an

for the completion of the investigation. In the event of an incident occurring within
jurisdiction of the City and County of Denver, the Denver Police Department will
allow RTD Street Supervisors to cover and clear the incident if the following criteria
apply:
•

No injuries

•

Under $1 000 damage

No indication either driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs

•

No uninsured drivers involved

•

No dispute as to the party at fault

• Each driver possesses a valid driver's license

the Controller should designate an "Investigating Supervisor" to be responsible for
persons and equipment at the scene. A second Supervisor may be asked ~o assist
at the scene or to assist with the continued movement of other trains on the

Page 6 of 10

Packet Pg. 216

•

Time of incident/accident.

•

Location of the incident/accident.

Employees must not speculate as to what may have been the cause of the
incident/accident and should politely decline questions directed to them by anyone
other than the police or District officials, indicating that the matter is under

District officials that the conversation is not overheard by those standing nearby.

V. INVESTIGATION METHOD
The Supervisor should immediately identify him/herself to the emergency services
personnel at the scene and begin to coordinate activities with these personnel and
the Controller. The Supervisor should be particularly alert for further safety hazards
resulting from the incident/accident such as:

·

•

Overhead wire is always to be assumed energized. In the case of a side impact,
the potential for 750V energization to the LRV and the other vehicle exists. This
will occur when skirt damage to the LRV exists. Be sure the pantograph has
also been lowered on all other cars in consist.

•

Passengers and observers on the right-of-way.

•

The need for passenger evacuation onto the right-of-way.

•

The extent of injuries to passengers, employees and other persons.

•

Passenger protection, including the provision of first aid, if qualified.

Supervisors conducting an investigation should bear in mind that an
incident/accident investigation is a search for facts. The investigator should
maintain an open mind and not jump to conclusions. The primary objectives of an
investigation are to:
•

Gather all the facts which may have contributed to the incident/accident.

•

Collect all the physical evidence which might have a bearing on the cause of the
incident/accident.

•

Provide sufficient

The scene of an incident/accident. Several photos should be taken to
provide an overview:
In each direction away from the point of impact.
From each approach to the point of impact, showing the views of the Train
Operator and any other vehicle driver involved, and the alignment of the
trackway and roadway.
Of the point of impact, close up.
Of the overall view of the scene, including street signs for later
identification of the scene.
Of all the vehicles involved, to illustrate the extent of damage.

All reports, diagrams, photographs, tapes or transcripts of interviews, etc. must be sent to

Description:
A representation of a first and last mile solution. This project will initially connect the 61st and Pena rail station to the Panasonic
building, an emerging apartment complex and the 61st and Pena Park-n-Ride…Potential Phase 2 may ultimately connect
passengers traveling between the 61st and Pena rail station and the 61st and Tower Road bus stop (approximately 4 blocks away).

Project Goals:
The “61AV Project” will utilize an AV shuttle to connect the 61st and Pena rail station with the nearby Panasonic building and the 61st
and Pena Park-n-Ride. Possible Phase 2 may connect to the 61st and Tower bus stop. The project goals are as follows:
1. Safely introduce an autonomous vehicle on a public roadway in Denver.
2. Assess the reliability and availability of an AV shuttle vehicle and its suitability for a transit application.
3. Provide first/last mile service to/from an RTD bus/rail station.
4. Align interests of all stakeholders/partners in order to advance the project.
