B. Recommended Actions

• Award of Access-a-Ride Call Center Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride Call Center services
with First Transit Inc. This contract is for three years, with two, one-year
options for a total five year amount not to exceed $15,114,226. This
proposal represents the most responsive and cost-efficient proposal received
in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 18-DK-001, to provide “Accessa-Ride Call Center” Services. The contract to provide this service is
scheduled to be effective October 1, 2018.
This recommendation addresses two of the General Manager’s 2018 goals:
Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management.

item to the full Board at the August 21, 2018
