Board Meeting Date: May 26, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2014 as prepared by Staff and
audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2014 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
District as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2014 and 2013 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2014 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2014 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the
enclosed Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District as of
December 31, 2014, has been compiled. Responsibility for the accuracy of the presented data and
the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD.
Management believes the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating
results of RTD. Disclosures necessary to enable the reader to gain the maximum understanding of the
financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the
adequacy of internal accounting controls. These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer
in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s internal accounting controls
adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance
Officers Association of the United States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the
accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis, the financial statements, notes thereto and supplemental information. In addition, the
supplementary information contains unaudited financial information by fund.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of
RTD, demographics, and other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of
RTD’s financial statements performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the
report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished
without the dedicated efforts of the entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or
comments, please contact me or Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer (Acting).
Respectfully submitted,
Tom Tobiassen, CISSP, CISA

April 30, 2015
Mr. Tom Tobiassen
Chair, Financial, Administration and Audit Committee
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD.
Consequently, management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all
of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these
representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control
framework that is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse
and to compile sufficient, reliable information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in
conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not outweigh their benefits,
RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable
rather than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material
misstatement. As management, we assert that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, this
financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, and a firm of licensed
certified public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable
assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, are
free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the
audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, are fairly presented in conformity with
GAAP. The independent auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial
Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not
only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s
internal controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal
controls and legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are
in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in

conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was
the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional
Transportation District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to
develop, maintain, and operate a public mass transportation system for the benefit of the
District.”
RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and
County of Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over
2.87 million people, or approximately 57% of the population of Colorado, reside within RTD’s
2,340 square mile area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their
constituents to serve four-year terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 180,000 voters
per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the
agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in
concert with local, state, and federal agencies.
RTD employs over 2,700 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight
county areas. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride and fixed
route services employing over 1,700 men and women. Besides its administrative headquarters
in Denver, RTD has six operating facilities, including three in Denver, one in Aurora, one in
Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those
activities of its component unit, the RTD Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a
nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The
budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt
service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All
departments of RTD are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager
on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses these requests as the starting
point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed
budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is
required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later
than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority,
as stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds
for capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.

RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within
the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section
of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most
populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the
Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse
mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a
geographic balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its December 2014 report forecasts that the
economic recession has subsided and a modest recovery has begun. Economists for CLC
reported the following key economic indicators.

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the
“Amendment”) that limits taxes, revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective
December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the
revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and
spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to
finance the construction of the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as
long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales
and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any revenue and
spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements
included in the FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s
sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed
through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement plan of RTD. It reflects RTD’s plans for
service and capital improvements excluding FasTracks. In November 2010, the Board of
Directors convened a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of developing a formal
written report that was submitted to the Board of Directors in June 2011, detailing opportunities
for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancements to ensure RTD’s fiscal sustainability in the
long term. The Task Force consisted of 21 members from RTD management, the Board of
Directors and the public and private sector. The Board of Directors gave approval to

management to pursue implementation of the Task Force’s recommendations. The SBP
includes those recommendations that have been implemented in the SBP timeframe, most
notably an operational service adjustment, enhanced sales and use tax forecasts and
implementation of a revised fund balance policy which was implemented in 2013. On July 16,
2013, the Board adopted the 2014-2019 SBP.
In addition to the SBP, RTD is planning and constructing the build-out of the FasTracks transit
expansion plan. FasTracks entails the addition of six new light-rail lines and commuter rail lines,
21,000 new parking spaces, the redevelopment of Denver Union Station, and expanded bus
service throughout the eight county District. Each year, RTD conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the entire FasTracks program, called an Annual Program Evaluation. RTD has
worked closely with elected officials, local governments, corridor stakeholders and the public to
move the FasTracks program forward.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014
found a material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of applicable
laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants. In
2012, RTD modified its fund balance policy to establish a structure that was recommended by
the RTD Fiscal Sustainability Task Force as being a necessary tool in designating funds to be
available for specific purposes to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines
and result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s
Investors Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the
sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA+” that are secured by the
0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and
Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit
“AA” that are secured by the 0.4% sales tax.

1.B.1.a

Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments,
benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market
funds, U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
investments for the year was 0.2%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is
self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $350,000 per person and $990,000 per
occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute. The self-insured
retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above
this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado
worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $1,663,245,896 for buildings,
their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy and Faithful
Performance Bond; a $3,500,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond; Felonious Assault Policy;
travel insurance for employees on RTD business; fidelity coverage on the Trustees of the Union
Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union Trust, Legal
Trust, and the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees.
With the growth of Light Rail Transit (LRT) services, RTD has added Railroad Protective and
Railroad Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when required under
operational needs.
The Risk Management Division coordinates these programs internally for RTD.
OTHER INFORMATION
Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public
accountants. The accounting firm of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2014 audit.
This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the Federal Single Audit Act
amendments of 1996 and related OMB Circular A-133. The auditor’s report on the financial
statements and schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s
report related specifically to the single audit is included in a separate report.
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. This is the twenty-second
consecutive year, after a two-year absence from the program, that RTD has been awarded this
prestigious award.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD
must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards. This report must also satisfy
both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.

The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report meets the program’s requirements and will be
submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely
basis was made possible by the dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division.
Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation for the contributions made in the
preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors,
preparation of this report would not have been possible.

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the
changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 36 and 73, respectively, be presented to supplement the basic
financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which
considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial
statements in an appropriate operational, economic or historical context. We have
applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the
information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s
responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements and other knowledge we
obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an
opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do
not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary And Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, summary schedules, introductory section and
statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a
required part of the basic financial statements.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District

The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The summary schedules, introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected
to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated April 30, 2015 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering
RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Dollars in Thousands)
The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements
this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial
activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated,
are expressed in thousands of dollars.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, total assets of RTD exceeded total liabilities $3,181,074 and
$2,977,449 respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2014 was $18,842
compared to $53,218 in 2013.
The net position of RTD increased by $203,625 during the current year compared to an increase of
$248,539 in the previous year. The increases in both years are due to higher operating revenues and tax
and grant revenues, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses which resulted
from an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense reduction initiatives
undertaken by RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues
increased $46,135 (9.8%) in 2014 and increased $18,799 (4.2%) in the previous year due to broad-based
increases in retail sales within the District as the local economy emerges from the recession.
For 2014, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating
revenue and expenses of $534,199 compared to a loss of $515,697 for 2013. The increase in operating
loss in 2014 was due to the increased cost of salaries and fringe benefits and a full year of West Rail
operating expenses. RTD anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating
sales and use tax, grant revenues and other miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt increased $501,624 (18.5%) and increased $285,219 (11.7%) in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Debt increased in 2014 due to the issuance of certificates of participation primarily for the
purpose of funding of construction of North Metro Rail Line as well as well as borrowings on the
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) bond for construction of the FasTracks
project elements. Debt increased in 2013 due to the issuance of certificates of participation primarily for
the scheduled replacement of fleet vehicles as well as borrowings on the TIFIA bond for construction of
the FasTracks project elements
Capital grants and other contributions decreased $36,135 (14.9%) in 2014 and decreased $69,110
(22.2%) in the previous year. The decrease in 2014 occurred as a result of the reduced contributed capital
from the Denver Union Station construction project which was completed in 2014. The decrease in 2013
occurred after receiving certain one-time grants in 2012 associated with federal economic stimulus
programs as well as scheduled higher grant funding on the West Line and East Corridor.
RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $814,250 in 2014 and increased $748,201 in
2013. The increase in 2014 was from replacement of fleet. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to the
build-out of the FasTracks project.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Dollars in Thousands)
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements.
RTD’s financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the
same basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an
economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used. Revenue is recorded
when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.
The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resource and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net
position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating
revenues and expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined
with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That
change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the
end of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event
giving rise to the changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance
reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements
of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to
assess the following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures;
the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the
effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statement of net position, statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statement of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,340 square mile area in and around Denver,
Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the
District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System operations of RTD. The Base
System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area. The
0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those
program elements as well as providing for enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue
sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance, investment income, and
other income such as advertising and rental income.

and statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Dollars in Thousands)
Statements of Net Position - As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, total assets of RTD exceeded total
liabilities by $3,181,074 and $2,977,449 respectively. The largest portion of this excess, 93.9% in 2014
and 93.6% in 2013, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to
provide public transportation services to customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future
spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted
that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as sales and use tax,
since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted
net position as of December 31, 2014 was $18,842 compared to $53,218 in 2013. Substantially all of the
unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, has been appropriated or reserved by the RTD
Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy requirements, and debt liquidation during the budget
process.

In 2014, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased $716,720 (15.3%) for acquisition of
revenue equipment, buildings, land, and construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks
program.
Current liabilities decreased $5,317 (1.7%) in 2014 primarily due to an accrued lower construction
payment for the FasTracks Eagle P3 project to the project concessionaire due in early 2015. Noncurrent
liabilities and deferred inflows increased $538,732 (18.9%) primarily due to the issuance of certificates of
participation for construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue.
RTD’s net position increased $203,625 (6.8%) in 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher
operating, tax and grant revenues, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses
which resulted from an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense reduction
initiatives undertaken by RTD.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Dollars in Thousands)

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 12.8% and 12.4% of total revenues in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares increased by $2,656 (2.3%) in 2014 compared
to an increase of $4,912 (4.3%) in 2013. The increase in 2014 was due in part, to full year of revenue
service of the West Line light rail line which opened in April 2013 while additional increases in both years
were due to higher participation in fare media programs.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.5% of total revenues in 2014 and
2013; this includes revenues from advertisements primarily on RTD’s buses and external wraps on light
rail vehicles. Advertising and other income decreased $793 (15.3%) in 2014 compared to a decrease of
$134 (2.5%) in 2013. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to reduced joint venture revenue contracts.
The decrease in 2013 occurred with the expiration of certain facility leases that occurred with the
redevelopment of the Denver Union Station historic building.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 54.8% and 49.2% of RTD’s total revenues in 2014 and
2013 respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service
area. Sales and use tax increased $46,135 (9.8%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $18,799 (4.2%) in
2013. In 2014 and 2013, the District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased consumer and
business spending activity as the local economy continues to emerge from the recession.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 8.0% and 9.3% of total revenues in
2014 and 2013. Grant operating assistance decreased $12,699 (14.4%) in 2014 compared to an increase
of $19,316 (28.0%) in 2013. The operating assistance is a federal grant revenue program used to perform
capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The
decrease/increase in 2014 and 2013 is the result of grant funding sources being available during the year.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 0.02% and 0.21% of total revenues in 2014 and 2013.
Investment income decreased $1,875 (91.9%) in 2014 compared to a decrease of $573 (21.9%) in 2013.
The decrease in 2014 and 2013 was due to lower interest rates and a progressively lower investment
balance as invested funds are being utilized for the build-out of the FasTracks project in addition to
unrealized losses attributed to mark-to-market valuation under a rising interest rate environment.

Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.8% and 3.0% of total revenues in 2014
and 2013. Other income decreased $11,309 (40.1%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $13,676
(94.4%) in 2013. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2014 was due to the one time increase in 2013 which
was primarily attributable to the sale of RTD’s Civic Center air rights and the sale of an easement on RTD
property.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and other contributions provided 22.0% and
25.5% of total revenues in 2014 and 2013. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $36,135
(14.9%) in 2014 and decreased $69,110 (22.2%) in the previous year. The decrease in both years
resulted from lower capital contributions related to completion of Denver Union Station multi-modal hub.

Salaries and wages–Salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting for 19.5% and
19.3% of the total RTD expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased
by $7,453 (5.5%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $8,103 (6.4%) in 2013. Increases in both years
occurred from salary and wage performance (result based) and progression increases.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)
December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Dollars in Thousands)
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 8.4% and 8.1% of total expenses in 2014 and 2013. Fringe
benefits increased by $4,932 (8.7%) compared to an increase of $5,328 (10.4%) in 2013. The increase in
2014 is primarily due to medical costs; resulting from CBA employer contribution ranging from $165$185/employee increase and salaried medical costs also increased from prior year. Pension cost also
increased in 2014 due to increased wages and Net Pension Obligation (NPO). The 2013 increase was
due primarily to an increase in the Net Pension Obligation (NPO).
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 8.5% and 9.2% of
the total RTD expenses in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased
$2,642 (4.1%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $6,498 (11.1%) in 2013. The decrease in 2014
occurred due to a decrease in diesel fuel prices from an average of $3.26 to $3.12. In addition, repair
parts costs decreased significantly in 2014. The increase in 2013 occurred due to the opening of the West
Line and an increase in diesel fuel prices from an average of $2.73 to $3.26 per gallon.
Services – Services expense accounted for 14.8% and 16.0% of total expenses in 2014 and 2013.
Services expense includes contracted services such as security services; vehicle, equipment and right of
way maintenance services; advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense
decreased $3,559 (3.2%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $2,626 (2.4%) in 2013. The decrease in
2014 was primarily due to the contract service reduction for U.S. 36 managed lane project. The increase
in 2013 was primarily due to the opening of the West Line.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.9% of total expenses for both years 2014 and 2013. Utilities expense
includes electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities. Utilities expense
increased $584 (4.3%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $1,734 (14.7%) in 2013. The increase in 2014
occurred primarily due to the full year of service for the West Line opened in April 2013 while lesser
increases in both 2014 and 2013 occurred due to higher electricity rates affecting traction power costs for
light rail services.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 0.7% and 0.8% of total expenses in 2014 and 2013. Insurance
expense includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims. In
addition, RTD purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets. Insurance expense decreased $295
(5.3%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $1,792 (47.5%) in 2013. The decrease in 2014 was due to
favorable claim severity and frequency results. The increase in 2013 due to Worker Compensation claims.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 15.6% and
16.0% of the total expenses in 2014 and 2013. Purchased transportation represents the costs of
contracted transportation services for bus, access-a-Ride, and call-n-Ride services. Purchased
transportation costs increased $1,936 (1.7%) in 2014 compared to $1,876 (1.7%) in 2013. The increase in
both years was primarily due to negotiated contract increases.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers. Leases and rentals expense increased $54 (1.7%) in
2014 compared to an increase of $809 (33.7%) in 2013. The increase in 2014 is primarily due to RTD’s
need for additional office space.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in
other defined categories. Miscellaneous expenses increased $113 (1.8%) in 2014 compared to a
decrease of $9,293 (59.0%) in 2013. This category includes additional one-time project expenses creating
fluctuations between years.

Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 18.9% and 18.1% of the total RTD
expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of
the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense increased
$11,789 (9.3%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $11,987 (10.4%) in 2013. The increase in 2014
occurred primarily from the activation of the West Line into revenue service in April. The increase in 2013
occurred primarily due to a full year of depreciation for Denver Union Station project elements that were
placed into service.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 9.8% and 8.7% of the total RTD
expenses in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest expense increased $11,070 (18.1%) in 2014 compared
to an increase of $9,852 (19.2%) in 2013. Interest expense increases are due to the additional borrowings
surrounding the FasTracks build-out and scheduled fleet replacements.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories. Other expense decreased $541 (13.0%) in 2014 compared to a decrease of $749
(15.3%) in 2013. The decrease in 2014 was the result on reduced loss of sales of assets compared to
prior year.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and
improvements; leasehold improvements; revenue and non-revenue vehicles; shop and service equipment;
security and surveillance equipment; computer equipment; and furniture. RTD’s investment in capital
assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2014 was $5,413,455 compared to $4,696,735 in 2013. The
increase in capital assets in 2014 was $716,720 (15.3%) compared to an increase of $640,607 (15.8%) in
2013. RTD acquires its assets with sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants,
and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and certificates of participation. The increases during 2014
and 2013 were primarily due to the cost of planning, design and construction of FasTracks projects.
The following table summarizes capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, as of December 31, 2014
and 2013 with comparative information for 2012.

participating agencies in 2004. In addition, RTD acquired approximately two acres of property to relocate
light rail tracks adjacent to the Consolidated Mainline. Expenditures for 2014 were $38,623 for the
construction of assets.
FasTracks Denver Union Station Historic Building - In connection with the redevelopment of the
Denver Union Station area as a multi-modal transportation center, a contract was entered in December
2013 with Union Station Alliance (USA) to redevelop the historic building. Under the agreement, USA
redeveloped the historic building to include the Great Train Hall, Amtrak facilities, a 110 room hotel as well
as restaurant and retail services. The Historic Building re-opened to the public in 2014 with USA will lease
the building from RTD to operate and maintain these new amenities. Expenditures for 2014 were
approximately $565.
FasTracks West Corridor - The West Corridor is a 12.1 mile light rail transit corridor between the Auraria
Campus in downtown Denver and the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, serving Denver,
Lakewood, the Denver Federal Center, Golden and Jefferson County. The West Line opened for revenue
service in April 2013 and was the first corridor completed in the FasTracks program. In 2014,
expenditures related to the West Corridor were approximately $10,128.
FasTracks North Metro Corridor - The North Metro Corridor is an 18 mile rail transit corridor between
Denver Union Station and 162nd Avenue, passing through Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn
and unincorporated Adams County. A construction contract was entered to complete the commuter rail
line from DUS north to 124th Avenue by 2018 with an option to extend construction to 162nd Avenue if
additional funding is identified. In 2014, expenditures related to the North Metro Corridor were
approximately $96,496.
FasTracks Northwest Corridor - The Northwest Corridor is a 41 mile transit corridor between Denver
Union Station and Longmont, passing through Denver, Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder,
Longmont, unincorporated Adams County, and unincorporated Boulder County and was constituted as a

expenditures related to the Northwest Corridor were $29,734.
East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010,
RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the
transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program. The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000
project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line Corridors as well as
the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire,
Denver Transit Partners (DTP), through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was
$305,000 below internal estimates. The project is expected to begin revenue service in 2016.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility and design work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the
Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. In 2014, construction expenditures related to the Eagle P3 project
were $407,147. The Eagle P3 Project elements are described below:

Extension were $1,269. RTD has applied for a New Start Grant to fund the project.
Additional information on RTD’s capital assets can be found in note D of this report.
Debt Administration
Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bonds and certificates of participation.
The 2014 outstanding debt was $3,219,223 compared to $2,717,599 in 2013. Outstanding debt increased
by $501,624 (18.5%) in 2014 and increased by $285,219 (11.7%) in 2013. The increase in both years
2014 and 2013 is due to new COPs issued for rail projects and well as replacement of rolling stock.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and
construction of assets. The sales tax revenue bonds were $1,955,657 and $1,895,180 as of December
31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The sales tax revenue bonds increased $60,477 (3.2%) in 2014
compared to an increase of $66,418 (3.6%) in 2013. The increase in 2014 and 2013 is due to the receipt
of the TIFIA loan borrowings. The sales tax revenue bonds are payable from RTD’s sales and use tax
revenue. RTD is required to maintain certain minimum deposits, as defined in bond resolutions, to meet
debt service requirements. The bonds may be redeemed prior to maturity, at a price equal to the
principal amount plus accrued interest thereon and a premium to the date of redemption.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the
Regional Transportation District Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit
corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being
used to acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment
acquired with the proceeds from the Certificates under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements.
For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its own debt. Certificates
outstanding were $1,064,855 and $655,230 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The
Certificates outstanding increased $409,625 (62.5%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $160,280
(32.4%) in 2013. The increase in 2014 was due to the issuance of Certificates for the construction of

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after the adoption of the 2014 Budget
Sales and use taxes are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 54.8% and 49.2% of
the total revenues in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by changes in
the local economy. Sales and use taxes declined significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
throughout 2009 as a result of the Great Recession. Modest improvements in sales and use tax revenues
began to occur in 2010 resulting in a recovery to pre-recession levels during 2014. Actual sales and use
tax revenue for 2014 was $514,721, an increase of $46,135 (9.8%) from 2013.
Increases in operating expenditures are expected in future years due to expansion of RTD’s FasTracks
program. The FasTracks program is a plan to build a comprehensive, integrated region-wide transit
network that will provide a reliable and safe system, enhance mobility and respond to the growing
transportation needs within the eight-county Regional Transportation District. The FasTracks program
includes 122 miles of new light rail and commuter rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit infrastructure, 57 new
stations, 31 new park-n-Rides, and redevelopment of Denver Union Station. Funding for the FasTracks
program is being secured through Federal Transit Administration (FTA) grants, sales and use taxes and

other revenues, issuance of long term debt, and public-private partnerships. Due to the 2008-9
recessions, sales and use tax revenues declined significantly delaying construction while materials costs
increased. These factors are projected over the long-term to leave a gap in funding necessary to complete
the program.
The first FasTracks rail line opened on April 26, 2013, adding 12.1 miles of new light rail running from
Denver Union Station to Golden. The West Line has 11 new light rail stations and six Park-n-Rides
serving the Auraria campus, Denver, Lakewood, the Federal Center, Golden and Jefferson County.
The North Metro Rail Line is an 18.5-mile long commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station
through Commerce City, Thornton and Northglenn to state Highway 7 in North Adams County. On
December 13, 2013 RTD signed a $343 million contract with Regional Rail Partners (RRP) to design and
build the first 13 miles of the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue. Construction of the line to 124th
Avenue is expected to be completed by 2018.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning
agency, a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General
Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In
1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation
system for the benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15
separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and
certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit. The
component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of
the significance of its operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement
by March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of
RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended requiring RTD to
increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill was
amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private
transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system
under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entity – Blended Component Unit
The Regional Transportation District Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was
formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing
certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the
Authority. The Authority serves as a financing mechanism for various financing
arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncement 61 issued by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of
component units in the primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity
related to the underlying financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a
blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31,
2014 and 2013. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating
revenues and expenses.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Dollars in Thousands)

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both
restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use
restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.
4. Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an
original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at
cost or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of
more than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out)
method.
7. Other Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of
construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward
the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have
not been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial
arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD
as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in
excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating
expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of
property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the respective accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue
and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which
were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the
date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and
taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted) interest to be capitalized
is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings on issuance
proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average
construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the
outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD consisted of the following as of December 31:
Interest expense
Capitalized interest
Total interest cost

2014
$72,293
50,281
$ 122,574

2013
$ 61,223
50,952
$ 112,175

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other
equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the
accompanying financial statements.
The cost of fully depreciated assets was
approximately $446,561 and $429,924 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
12. GASB 65 – Classification
RTD implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 65 Items
Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2013. The
objective of GASB 65 is to either properly classify certain items that were previously
reported as assets and liabilities as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of
resources or recognize certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities
as outflows of resources (expenses or expenditures) or inflow of resources (revenue).
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred outflow of resources. This separate financial statement element,
deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a
future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of resources
(expense/expenditure) until then. The District’s deferred outflows consisted of losses on
deferred refunding of $39,736 and $43,471 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element,
deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a
future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that
time. The District’s deferred inflows consisted of a gain on deferred refunding of $627 and
$656 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of
absence is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have
been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements.
13. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis
of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option
as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are
incurred.
14. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue
is collected from the farebox. Sales of monthly passes are recorded initially as unearned
revenue and recognized as income at the end of the month for which the pass is used.
Sale of ten ride tickets is recorded as income at the time of sale. Sales of college based
passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the
amount recognized in each month determined by prorating the total contract amount over
the semesters/quarters covered. Sales of Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass, which are
valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue.
Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount
prorated evenly over the number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net
taxable sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use
inside the District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A and Series 2013 bond
resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt service. Sales and
use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and are remitted
to a trustee who satisfies debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond
and commercial paper resolutions, and remits the balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales and Use Tax Bonds debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales
and use revenues in the amount of approximately $3,115,885 through 2050. Principal and
interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $98,527.
Grants and Other Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA), and the Department of Homeland Security (HSEC). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of
Transportation. The federal and state government issues grants to RTD for operations
and acquisition of property and equipment.

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The amount recorded as capital grants was $171,549 and $159,783 in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $75,544 and $88,243 in 2014 and
2013, respectively. Other contribution revenue was $34,882 and $82,783 in 2014 and
2013, respectively.
Grant and other contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month that the actual
eligible grant expenditure was paid by RTD.
15. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum
standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes
appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to
GAAP provides a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state
and local governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and
assumptions about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
16. Reclassification of Prior Year Amounts (Current Assets)
The Marketable interest bearing investments – restricted (Note B) include both current and
long term investments. The restricted investments were previously classified as current
assets. The restricted long term portions were reclassified to long-term marketable interest
bearing investments, 2014 and 2013 respectively.
NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA).
Under this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with
pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or
held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe
by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public
depository and held in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDP Act requires that pledged
collateral to be held is clearly identified as being security maintained or pledged for the
aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public
depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral
maintained or pledged and is at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from
those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $43,749 and
$56,950 collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust
department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

Concentration of Credit Risk, it is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio.
Assets held in the investment funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting
from over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a specific issue or a specific class of
securities. The asset allocation in the portfolio should, however, be flexible, depending upon
the outlook for the economy and the securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted
investments. As of December 31, 2014, RTD was in compliance with these limits. As of
December 31, 2013, RTD was in compliance with limitations set out in RTD’s previous

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency
obligations below the highest rating category, but no lower than one of the two highest rating categories,
RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements of
CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity from the date of settlement to three years, provided that
the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be
set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any more than 25%
being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal
documentation governing the transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment
policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum exposure limits listed above.
At December 31, 2014 and 2013, RTD had $883,409 and $862,250 of cash and investments

NOTE E – LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
In prior years, RTD defeased certain obligations by placing the proceeds of new obligations in
an irrevocable trust to provide for all future service payments on the old obligations. Accordingly,
the trust account assets and the liability for the defeased obligations are not included in these
financial statements. Outstanding as of December 31, 2014 are the following amounts which
are considered defeased:

In July 2014, RTD issued its Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A in the par amount of
$440,915 with an average interest rate of 4.46% for the purpose of funding the construction of
the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to approximately 124th Avenue. Certain
proceeds were also used to fund a debt service reserve fund for the certificates and pay for
related costs of issuance. The final maturity of the certificates is in 2044.
In 2014, RTD drew $80,000 from the Transportation Infrastructure and Innovation Act (TIFIA)
loan. Under the TIFIA loan authorization, RTD may draw up to $280,000. The draws from the
TIFIA loan will be used to pay for “Eligible Project Costs” on RTD’s Eagle Project. The interest
rate on the TIFIA loan is 3.14% with principal and interest payments anticipated to begin in 2025
and final maturity expected in 2045. The TIFIA loan will be used to complement the other
sources of debt, resulting in a lower cost of funding than would have otherwise been available in
the capital markets. The first TIFIA draw of $125,000 was made in 2013 with the remaining
$75,000 of the $280,000 authorization to be drawn in futures years. The TIFIA loan is secured
by a pledge of RTD’s 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax.
In December 2014, RTD entered into a Modification and Exchange agreement with Citibank
N.A. who owned certain of the RTD Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project),
Series 2007A. The agreement modified the call dates on the affected bonds from November 1,
2017 to November 1, 2024. The affected bonds which were all owned by Citibank N.A. were as

NOTE E – LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
The 2007A bonds that are not owned by Citibank N.A. were not affected by this Modification
and Exchange agreement. Proceeds of the agreement were $17,068 of which $552 was used
for costs and RTD accrued a long term arbitrage liability of $2,620.
In March 2013, RTD issued its Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A in
the par amount of $96,580 with an average interest rate of 1.44% for the purpose of advance
refunding the Series 2004A and 2005A Sales Tax Revenue Bonds with an average interest rate
of 5.00%. The proceeds of the 2013A bonds were deposited with the escrow bank and invested
in government obligations maturing at such time and in such amounts as required to provide
funds sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the refunded bonds as they become due.
The Series 2004A and 2005A bonds had required debt service payments of $131,949 and the
Series 2013A bonds require debt service payments of $102,055. The refunding achieved an
economic gain (difference between the present value of the debt service on the old and new
bonds) of 4.19% or $4,378.
In April 2013, RTD issued its Certificates of Participation Series 2013A in the par amount of
$224,045 with an average interest rate of 4.72% for both the purpose of advance refunding the
then outstanding Series 2005 Certificates of Participation in the amount of $52,920 with an
average interest rate of 4.83% and the acquisition of buses and ticket vending machines for use
in RTD’s operations. Certain proceeds were also used to fund a debt service reserve fund for
the Certificates. The Series 2005 certificates had required debt service payment of $52,196 and
the Series 2013A certificates require debt service payments of $45,857. The refunding achieved
economic gain (difference between the present value of the debt service on the old and new
bonds) of 6.93% or $2,633.
In May 2013, RTD issued its Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series
2013A in the par amount of $204,820 with an average interest rate of 4.85% for the purpose of
advance refunding the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2006A with an
average interest rate of 4.75%. The proceeds of the 2013A FasTracks bonds were deposited
with the escrow bank and invested in government obligations maturing at such time and in such
amounts as required to provide funds sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the refunded
bonds as they become due. The Series 2006A bonds had required debt service payments of
$430,956 and the Series 2013A FasTracks bonds require debt service payments of $376,798.
The refunding achieved economic gain (difference between the present value of the debt
service on the old and new bonds) of 5.50% or $12,972.

NOTE F– EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND UNEARNED COMPENSATION PLANS
Plan Description
RTD maintains two single-employer defined benefit pension plans and one defined contribution
plan for substantially all full-time employees. The Regional Transportation District Salaried
Employees’ Pension Plan (the RTD Plan) covers all non-union, full-time salaried employees
whom were hired prior to January 1, 2008. The RTD defined contribution plan (the RTD DC
Plan) represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The Regional
Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Pension Plan (the Union
Plan) was established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the
Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented employees in accordance
with the union agreement. The Board of Directors of each plan has the authority for establishing
and amending benefits and funding policy. Each plan is administered by a pension board and
issues audited financial statements, which include financial information for that plan. Those
financial statements may be obtained from the plan:
Regional Transportation District
Salaried Employees Pension Trust
7000 North Broadway, Building 106
Denver, Colorado 80221

RTD ATU 1001 Pension Plan
2821 S. Parker Road
Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602

The RTD Plan provides retirement benefits to RTD salaried employees who retire at or after
age 55 with at least five years of service. These employees are entitled to a single lump sum
distribution or an annual retirement benefit, payable monthly for life. The normal retirement
benefit is equal to 2.5% of average final compensation to which a participant is entitled on the
day the participant retires, multiplied by the number of years of credited service.
The RTD Board adopted amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008, in which salaried
employee new hires shall not be eligible to participate in the RTD Plan. New salaried employees
will be eligible to participate in the new RTD DC Plan. The Board of Directors for the RTD DC
Plan has the authority for establishing and amending benefits and funding policy. RTD
contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions totaled $2,394 and $1,884 in
2014 and 2013, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the RTD DC Plan.
Membership was 392 and 322 active employees in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition,
RTD has one employee in 2014 and 2013 participating in both the RTD plan and the RTD DC
Plan due to a compensation level in excess of the 2014-2013 compensation limits imposed
under IRC section 401(a) (17).
The Union Plan provides retirement benefits to employees who retire at or after a certain age
with at least a specified number of years of service. These employees are entitled to a
percentage of their final average earnings based on age and credited service at retirement.
The following schedule (derived from the most recent actuarial valuation reports) reflects

Funding Policy
Contributions to the RTD Plan are actuarially determined. RTD employees are not required to
contribute to the RTD Plan. Contributions to the Union Plan are made in accordance with the
collective bargaining agreement. This agreement requires RTD to contribute 8% and the
employee to contribute 3% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Effective March 1, 2013 RTD is
to contribute 12% and the employee to contribute 4%. RTD has no liability to the Union Plan
beyond its contributions.
Funding Status
Based on actuarial valuations performed as of January 1, 2014, the RTD Plan had unfunded
actuarial accrued liabilities of $19,890 and the Union Plan had unfunded actuarial accrued
liabilities of $218,837. The actuarial value of assets for both plans is determined by spreading
gains and losses over a five-year period.

Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant
to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001
(ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver,
through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter. In addition to
the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for
participation in the Trust benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
all its terms and provisions so long as there continues to be a collective bargaining agreement
between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term
disability) for represented employees of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care
benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more per quarter. The Trust is
funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan
contributions is set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was
$13,876 and $11,727 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Trust
also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each employee and funds the
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of
its health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited
financial statements, which include financial information for the plan. The financial statements
may be obtained from the plan.

NOTE F – EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND UNEARNED COMPENSATION PLANS
(CONTINUED)
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance
with Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and
permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years. Under the terms of the
Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement, death
or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue
paid time off (PTO), vacation, and sick leave based on time in service; employees are not
allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave
based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence
balances upon leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current
liabilities under the principle of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD
would be obligated to pay in the near-term.
Compensated absences activity for the year ended December 31, 2014, was as follows:

NOTE H – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have
been leased to and subleased back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered
into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been leased to and subleased back.
As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received
from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a
third party trustee. The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments
owed by the RTD under the transactions and are therefore considered fully funded and
economically defeased.
U.S. Leveraged Lease
In July and December 1997, RTD entered into two U.S. leveraged lease agreements with Pitney
Bowes Credit Corporation for the lease and leaseback of 17 light rail vehicles and four
transportation and maintenance facilities. RTD has made investment arrangements to meet all
its payment obligations throughout the terms of the leases. A termination agreement was
executed and final payment on this defeased lease was made in March 2015.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2014, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and
the purchase of buses and light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the
purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $483,272 and $514,934 in 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching
requirements of these grants. At December 31, 2014, RTD had a commitment to provide
$16,130 in matching funds in order to receive $50,301 in future federal grant funds.
Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific
groups of routes, not to exceed 58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January
2014, slightly over 52.37% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by private contractors
operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to
provide paratransit service to the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses,
operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed route service. This service, called
Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request)
transportation system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular
fixed route system. Passengers eligible for Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip
within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed route. Since September 1996, RTD has
been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requirement to provide
paratransit service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.

NOTE H – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate
several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Corridor, the Gold Line Rail Corridor and the
electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3 Project). The Eagle
P3 Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has
entered into with a concessionaire that has been selected through a competitive proposal
process. The selected concessionaire is known as Denver Transit Partners (DTP), a special
purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction will be completed in two phases with Phase I completed in
2016 and Phase II completed in 2017. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD
will make scheduled construction payments to DTP each year from 2011 through 2017 for
completed project elements totaling $1,064,592. RTD will assume ownership of the Eagle P3
Project elements as they are constructed. In addition, RTD will make scheduled secured
principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017 through 2044 for the remaining Eagle P3
Project obligation totaling $1,438,234 resulting in a total project cost through 2044 of
$2,502,826. The Eagle P3 Project agreement also includes a provision whereby, upon project
completion and placement in service, DTP will operate and maintain the Eagle P3 Project during
the period 2016 through 2044 for which RTD will make service payments.
In 2011, RTD entered an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) to provide funding for 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) elements
between Denver and Boulder along the U.S. 36 highway. The funding will provide slip ramps
and access improvements to Park-n-Rides along the corridor in addition to transit related
improvements such as shared lanes along U.S. 36. The IGA requires funding of $141,570 from
RTD to CDOT of which $90,000 has been paid through December 31, 2014. The remaining
$51,570 will be paid in future years.
In 2012, RTD entered a contract with Kiewit Infrastructure Company to complete the 10.5 mile I225 light rail line, extending from the currently existing Nine Mile station to connect the
Southeast Line to the East Line. The I-225 Line is being completed in coordination with the
Colorado Department of Transportation’s I-225 highway project and will open in 2016 to provide
connectivity to major activity centers like the Aurora City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical
Center and Denver International Airport through a transfer at Peoria to the East Rail Line.
In December 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North
Metro Rail Line. The North Metro Rail Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will
run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7
at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The contract includes funding for the completion of
the rail line through 124th Avenue in 2018 with an option to construct the remaining segments
through 162nd Avenue.

Diesel Fuel Contract
RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Co of Gainesville, Inc. for diesel fuel. The contract is
structured as a single year contract. The fixed commitment under the Mansfield contract in
2015 is $15,989. RTD estimates usage of 9.8 million gallons at unit cost of $2.95 per gallon:
5.42 million RTD usage and 4.38 million RTD private carriers usage.
Contingencies
Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
audit by FTA. Although the outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s
opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an extent that they would materially affect
RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are
reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its
employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property
damage is $350 per individual and $990 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in
excess of $2,000. The amount of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of
the past three years.

NOTE H – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk Management determines incurred claims by investigating the
accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the
statement of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability
and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required to
pay certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that
the ultimate outcome of these matters is either sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability and
Workers’ Compensation reserves or would not materially affect the financial statements of
RTD. As of December 31, 2014, RTD owed $7.8 million to the Denver International Airport
(DIA) for certain costs that are part of RTD’s Eagle Project Development. These costs are
payable as a result of an arbitration. RTD is not disputing this obligation, has budgeted for it
and will pay it before the end of 2015. DIA is seeking additional payments and has appealed the
arbitration that resulted in the undisputed amount.
RTD is party to a pending lawsuit in which the claimant is seeking a refund of previously paid
sales taxes on purchases of aviation fuel as well as the discontinuance of such future sales tax
payments. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently issued guidance regarding
state and local taxation of aviation fuel in which RTD may no longer be authorized to collect
such taxes and possibly refund some taxes previously collected.

Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, have been
appropriated or reserved by the RTD’s Board for future capital acquisition, operating reserve
policy, and debt liquidation during the budget process.
NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the
budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and
expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal payments, and excludes TABOR
rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and
losses on disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for
operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays for the
calendar year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager submits to the Board of Directors a
proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following January 1,
which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the
budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who
must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence of such adoption, RTD
has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved
appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve
certain transfers within the budget.
A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual
revenue and expenses is as follows:

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA (CONTINUED)
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry over the unused portion of funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years. As of December 31,
2014, there was approximately $809 of unused 2014 appropriations for capital outlays available
for carryover to 2015.
NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment One) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation
and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves (balances). The amendment
requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multiyear debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers
unless voters approve retention of these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that
reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District
from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31,
2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue
and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred
to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any
debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased tax
revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate
will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid transit system financed through
FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’ limitations.
This debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid
transit improvement program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2014, $19,193 of
year-end net position, as restated, has been reserved for emergencies.
The Amendment is complex and subject to judicial interpretation. RTD believes it is in
compliance with the requirements of the Amendment based on the interpretations of the
Amendment’s language available at year-end.

Regional Transportation District

We have audited the basic financial statements of RTD for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our audit was
performed in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We also assessed the accounting principles
used by RTD and the reasonableness of significant estimates made by RTD’s management, as well as evaluated the
overall financial statement presentation.
Auditing standards require the auditor to ensure that those charged with governance receive additional information
regarding the scope and results of the audit that may assist the governing body in overseeing the financial reporting
and disclosure process for which management is responsible. The following section describes matters which are
required to be reported to you.

COMMENTS

Our Responsibility Under U.S. Generally Accepted
Auditing Standards, Government Auditing Standards
And OMB Circular A-133
Our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to
express an opinion about whether the financial statements
prepared by management with your assistance are fairly
presented, in all material respects, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and whether
RTD complied in all material respects with the applicable
compliance requirements of its major federal programs. Our
audit of the financial statements and compliance does not
relieve you or management of responsibility for the accuracy of
the financial statements and/or compliance with applicable
requirements.
Professional standards also require that we obtain a significant
understanding of RTD’s internal control to plan the audit.
However, such understanding is required for the purpose of
determining our audit procedures and not to provide any
assurance concerning such internal control. Accordingly, we
express no such assurance.

Reports issued by RubinBrown:

Unmodified report on RTD’s financial statements based
upon an audit of the financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America and Governmental Auditing Standards
RTD agreed-upon procedures reports regarding National
Transit Database reporting and the RTD GM contract
Other informational reports to be issued:
A report on RTD’s internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and other matters based upon an audit of
the financial statements in accordance with Governmental
Auditing Standards
A unmodified report on RTD’s compliance for each major
program and a report on internal control over compliance
and report on the schedule of expenditures of federal
awards in accordance with OMB Circular A-133

Planned Scope And Timing Of The Audit

We performed the audit according to the planned scope and
timing communicated in our letter dated September 22, 2014
regarding the timing and extent of our audit procedures.

Qualitative Aspects Of Accounting Practices
Management is responsible for the selection and use of
appropriate accounting policies. In accordance with the terms of
our engagement letter, we will advise management about the
appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.

Significant accounting policies are described in Note A.
No new accounting policies were adopted, and the
application of existing policies was not changed.
We noted no transactions entered into during the year for
which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or
consensus.
No significant transactions have been recognized in a
different period than when the transactions occurred.

Management Judgments And Accounting
Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the
use of accounting estimates. Certain estimates are
particularly sensitive due to their significance to the
financial statements and the possibility that future
events may differ significantly from management’s
expectations.

Financial Statement Disclosures

We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the
estimates in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates
affecting the financial statements are:
Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon estimated
useful lives of capital assets.
Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts is based on
management’s review of outstanding receivables.
Management’s estimate of the net pension obligation is based on
actuarial valuations and employee census data.
The disclosures are neutral, consistent and clear. Certain disclosures are
particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement
users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements
are:
The disclosure of capital assets in Note D
The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E
The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned compensation
plans in Note F
The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in Note H
The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations in Note K

Difficulties Encountered In Performing The Audit

There were no difficulties encountered in dealing with

Corrected And Uncorrected Misstatements

An estimated amount was proposed related to a potential
settlement on a litigation claim, which, in the aggregate,
decreased the change in net position by $7,800,000, that
management has determined are not material, both individually

Regional Transportation District

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of RTD as of and for the year ended December 31,
2014, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, we considered RTD’s internal control over
financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the RTD’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of
RTD’s internal control.
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was not
designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and
therefore, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses may exist that were not identified.
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct,
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will
not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.

Management Letter
(Continued)
Regional Transportation District

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the
following deficiency in the RTD’s internal control to be a significant deficiency:
OMB Circular A-133 Compliance:
Transportation Infrastructure Finance And Innovation Act (TIFIA) Loan Period Of Availability
The TIFIA loan agreement specified a funding period (period of availability), which is the period of time when eligible
project costs can be incurred for potential reimbursement under the program. The TIFIA loan agreement specified
eligible federal project costs were for work performed after November 6, 2009. RTD submitted reimbursement requests
that included expenditures outside of the period of availability and, as a result, incurred questioned costs of
approximately $1.5 million. RTD has identified other eligible project costs that meet the period of availability and is in
the process of amending the related reimbursement requests.
The TIFIA program is a federally funded loan, which is not a typical federal funding arrangement that RTD has
encountered previously; therefore, the loan program reimbursements were not subjected to the same internal controls
as federally funded reimbursement grants. We recommend that the RTD Grant Accountant prepare all reimbursement
requests for all federal funds including both grant and federal loan programs.

Management Letter
(Continued)
Regional Transportation District

In addition, the following are other matters involving internal control that we did not consider to be material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies:
Recode Of Transactions (Recurring):
RTD regularly recodes transactions to allocate expenditures:
From a general project to specific task within the project
From one federal source to another
From one project to another
From local sources to federal sources
The recodes occur for various reasons not limited to correcting errors, utilizing different funding sources or
refining/finalizing the accounting for a project. The recode entries are created by the budget analyst and
reapproved by the individuals who approved the original transactions. The Accounting Manager then reviews and
approves posting of the entry. While the Accounting Manager will consult with the FasTracks Program Control
Manager or Chief Financial Officer, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the recode, there is no other formal
documentation regarding approval of the recode. We recommend that management continue to enhance the
policy whereby recodes that meet certain quantitative or qualitative characteristics, such as a change in funding
source or project, be approved by the Program Control Manager or other appropriate designated individual.

First Quarter 2015 Investment Report

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: May 19, 2015

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2015 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded modestly (0.2 percent) during the first quarter of 2015. The unemployment
rate declined modestly over the period to 5.5% and general inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative monetary policy and leave the federal funds target
rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the first quarter. In determining how long to maintain this
target range, the committee will “assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

1st Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the first quarter of 2015 was 0.3% which would
produce annualized earnings of $714,763. The current yield for the month of March was 0.37%.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Purchasing Cards (PCards) are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and cost-effective
way to buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of Colorado Master
Contract for Credit Card Services, which operates through Citibank. At the current time, there
are approximately 16 Citibank ‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to RTD FasTracks employees.
Approval limits for FasTracks purchases do not exceed a $3,000 limit per individual transaction.
For calendar year 2014, almost $219,000 was spent by assigned FasTracks employees via their
PCards. The current PCard arrangement generates a semi-annual rebate to RTD of
approximately 1.7% of purchases.

AUDIT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
The scope of our audit included activity during the last quarter of 2014 and early 2015. Internal
Audit selected individual FasTracks employee PCard statements for review and testing of
supporting documentation and compliance with RTD policies including:





The procurement of appropriate goods and services for RTD business purposes were within
the employee’s assigned credit limits.
The monthly supervisory review and approval process was adequate and timely.
Individual transactions were not ‘split’ into two charges in order to qualify within the
employee’s credit limits.
PCard charges did not include Colorado state and local sales tax.

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing identified a need for FasTracks PCard holders and their management
reviewers to be reminded of purchases that are allowed, and when other departments should be
involved, including Information Technology when purchasing PC’s and related equipment. In
addition, employees have now been instructed to attach adequate explanations and supporting
documents when purchasing food for company meetings and furniture items for remote office
locations.

CURRENT STATUS
The AGM of FasTracks has issued a compliance ‘reminder memo’ to all of the Division’s PCard
holders and their management reviewers. He has also requested that Internal Audit perform a
follow-up review later this year to ensure that employees are properly following the prescribed
PCard Policies and Procedures.
