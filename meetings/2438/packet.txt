REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, House Bill 16-1008 was drafted and submitted to the General Assembly by the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), in partnership with RTD, and the State
Highway Patrol. This bill will change language in the CDOT enabling legislation, as CDOT has
direct control over the ability of vehicles to operate on the shoulders of state roadways. The
bill was heard on January 27, 2016, in the House Transportation Committee and passed by a
vote of 11-2.
WHEREAS, The provisions of House Bill 16-1008 will give RTD bus operators the option of
driving on the shoulders of US 36 only under certain conditions. Bus travel on the shoulders
can be done only when traffic in the general purpose lanes is travelling 35 miles per hour or
less, and it is up to the bus operator to determine if these conditions exist and if it is safe to
drive on the shoulder. The bus can then travel on the shoulder at a speed only 15 miles per
hour above the speed of the traffic in the general purpose lanes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that RTD Board of Directors adopts a position in support of
House Bill 16-1008 that will permit the Bus On Shoulder operations along US 36 for the voterapproved Bus Rapid Transit service, which is a part of the Board-approved Flatiron Flyer service
package.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
16th day of February 2016.

Date:

Subject:

RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the
name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and
revise the structure accordingly.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide.
Therefore, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the members of the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee recommend the Board revise the structure for the Citizens Advisory Committee as
follows:
Regional Transportation District
Citizens Advisory Committee
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
and business persons from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and
volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Committee Role
The role of the Citizens Advisory Committee shall be to:

Board.
Membership
The CAC shall consist of seventeen (17) members. Appointment is for a three-year term, with an
opportunity for one reappointment thereafter.

Selection Process
Recruitment for committee members will be publicly advertised through the RTD website, social media,
local publications, and stakeholder e-mail distribution lists. A five-member nominating committee will
review the applications and forward recommended candidates to the Board of Directors for appointment.
The nominating committee will consist of the following positions:

needed, the rules contained in the current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised shall govern
the Committee.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and revise the structure
accordingly.
2. Do not adopt the Recommended Action and retain the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee
as currently organized, solely focused on the FasTracks Program.
3. Do not adopt the Recommended Action and disband the FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee.

RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: February 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director District G so that all of
Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G, where a majority of the precinct
already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of households.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012, in accordance with CRS 32-9-111(1)(a), the Board approved a revised Director
District map to reflect changes in the District’s population as reflected in the 2010 Census. The
redistricting process required that, among other things, the individual Director Districts would be
comprised of whole general election precincts, as established by the boards of county commissioners of
those counties wholly or partially within the district and by the election commission of the City and
County of Denver and the City and County of Broomfield.
From time to time, the individual counties adjust precinct boundaries. Typically, the adjusted precincts
remain completely within individual Director Districts; however, Arapahoe County has adjusted its
precincts so that Precinct Number 356, all of which was previously in Director District G (Director
Lasater), now falls across the boundary of District G into District F (Director Tobiassen). See attached
map. A vast majority of the precinct remains in District G. The precinct in question lies slightly west of
South Powhatan Street, north of County Line Road. In order to change the Director District boundaries,
the Board must take action.
DISCUSSION
CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) states the following: “No general election precinct may be split into two or more
director districts.” Arapahoe County’s new precinct map places Precinct Number 356 over the boundary
of District F (Director Tobiassen) and District G (Director Lasater). In order to conform to statute, the
Board must adjust the Director District boundaries so that the new precinct lies exclusively in one
Director District. If the Director District boundaries were adjusted to follow the new precinct line, District
G would become marginally larger; conversely, Director District F would become marginally smaller. If
all of Precinct Number 356 is placed in Director District G, it appears that the adjustment would impact
only one household, which would become part of Director District G from District F. An alternative
option would be to expand Director District F to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 356, which
would then expand that Director District to now include approximately 100 additional households that
were previously part of Director District G.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial associated with this action.

2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors and do not approve the revised Director District boundary between Director
District F and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within
Director District G, where a majority of the precinct already lies. Instead, the Board could expand
Director District F to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 356, which would expand that
Director District to now include approximately 100 additional households.

Director

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and
description. It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions
of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:
a. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the Andalusia Annexation
– are recommended to be included in Director District I (Director Lubow); and
b. The Parker annexation – Todd Drive – is recommended to be included in Director District G
(Director Lasater).

BACKGROUND
In 1994, the Colorado legislature approved a bill to allow the annexation of land into RTD concurrent
with annexation into a municipality if any part or all of that municipality was in the District boundaries.
As new areas enter the district via municipal annexation, the newly annexed areas must be assigned to a
specific Director District. The Board must approve the designation of those areas to be in specific
Director Districts.
DISCUSSION
In December 2015, RTD found that three annexations had occurred whereby the District Boundary
would expand as follows: two annexations were made by the Town of Erie; the third was made by the
Town of Parker. Since these newly annexed areas have not been assigned to specific director districts,
Board action will be required. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the
Andalusia Annexation – are directly adjacent to Director District I (Director Lubow). The Parker
annexation – Todd Drive – is directly adjacent to District G (Director Lasater). Since each of the three
annexations directly connects to only one Director District, it appears appropriate that those areas are
assigned to the connecting Director District. The attached maps depict the annexed areas and the
adjacent director districts to which staff recommends they be assigned.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is anticipated with the requested action.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-011 eliminates annual transfers of $15.0 million for transit projects
from fee revenue imposed under the Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation and
Economic Recovery Act of 2009 (FASTER). This includes a $10.0 million transfer to the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) for transit related projects and $5.0
million for local transit projects.

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-011 is currently making its way through the Colorado General
Assembly. This bill would have a negative effect on RTD. RTD receives a minimum $3 million
allocation annually and then can compete in the approximately $2 million statewide
competitive pool. If RTD did not receive these additional funds each year, various projects
could not be completed. Projects that are currently in the pipeline for future allocations would
have to be delayed, or funds would need to be diverted from other capital projects to complete
the necessary work.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the RTD Board of Directors takes a position in
opposition to Senate Bill 16-011.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
16th day of February 2016.

Access-a-Ride Eligibility Assessments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Easter Seals
Colorado for the provision of ADA paratransit eligibility functional assessments. Performance under
the contract is for a five year period and shall not exceed $2,490,070.
BACKGROUND
RTD requires all potential applicants for Access-a-Ride services to participate in an in-person
functional assessment.
Formal functional assessments allow RTD to base an individual’s
determination/certification for eligibility for ADA paratransit services on the three categories of
eligibility under the ADA; the functional inability to get to or from the bus stop or light rail platform;
the ability to board and alight the bus or light rail car; or the ability/inability to understand how to
travel on fixed-route bus or light rail due to cognitive limitations.
Since its inception in 1992, the Access-a-Ride program has certified nearly 100,000 users. Of those
certified, approximately 15,000 individuals have used the service in the past year. RTD is currently
providing, on average, 2,800 Access-a-Ride trips per weekday.
The total number of assessments, which include re-certifications and new applications, for the last
five (5) years are as follows:
2015
2014
2013
2012
2011

-

4296
4547
4054
4357
3897

RTD currently contracts with Easter Seals Colorado to provide the functional assessments for
Access-a-Ride eligibility. The contract with Easter Seals Colorado will expire on March 31, 2016.
On November 6, 2015, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price
proposals to provide eligibility assessments. The RFP was downloaded from the RTD website by the
following firms:
MTM, Inc.
IPS Lynx

Easter Seals, Colorado
Innovative Paradigms

First Transit

Two of the firms submitted follow up questions which were responded to by November 27th. The
proposals were due on December 18, 2015.

Packet Pg. 19

2.12.F

DISCUSSION
One proposal was received in response to the RFP for eligibility evaluations. The Proposer was the
incumbent eligibility contractor, Easter Seals Colorado.
An evaluation committee was formed to evaluate the proposal based on the following evaluative
criteria: understanding of the RTD’s requirements and objectives (35%), experience (35%), and cost
(30%). The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services,
Larry Buter, Manager of Paratransit Services and Carol Coe, Paratransit Services Coordinator. Each
member of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted and assigned
a score for “Understanding of RTD’s requirements” and for “Experience.” Based on the average of
the individual scores received in these categories, Easter Seals of Colorado was deemed technically
qualified for an award. The score for the “Cost” element was calculated by RTD procurement staff
and was then added to the technical score of the proposal to determine the overall total score or
rating.
Easter Seals Colorado’s experience with providing eligibility evaluations for RTD and the experience
of their staff were key elements of their proposal. Proposed pricing was based on an estimated
amount of assessments provided by RTD in the RFP. These estimates were based on historical data.
The first year numbers are as follows:
Re-certifications
In person assessment
Indoor assessment
Outdoor assessment

1243
103
2334
948

The negotiated first year rates proposed by Easter Seals for the rebid of eligibility assessments are as
follows:
Re-certifications
In person assessment
Indoor assessment
Outdoor assessment

$17.42
$84.64
$102.78
$151.16

The five-year contract price is $2,490,070. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that Easter
Seals, Colorado presented a proposal which successfully addressed their understanding of the
project, proposed management team, and approach to delivering the requested service. A variety of
factors influenced their costs to come in slightly higher than the current contract plus inflation.
These factors included, increased administrative functions, an increase in time to complete the
assessment process per applicant, as well as an increase of costs for goods and services such as
language interpreters.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for 2016 are currently available and budgeted. Due to the higher proposed costs, it may be
necessary to request additional funds for 2016. If additional funds are required, staff will make that
request through the amended budget process. Subsequent years are subject to Board budget
approvals.
