## II. February Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Tobiassen called for a review of the February 16, 2016 Board meeting agenda.

Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to approve the February 16 Board agenda.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Francone expressed for the recommended action on SB16-011, her objection has to do with the language.  The statute is clear this should be for bridges and roads.  Director Solano asked if any amendments could be made to this and Dave responded that the Senate could make amendments as appropriate.  However, this is not a RTD bill.

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed with the full committee consenting.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

#### A. Resolution No. ___ Series of 2016, RTD Position on House Bill 16-1008

##### a. Resolution HB 16-1008

#### B. RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and revise the structure accordingly.

#### C. RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G, where a majority of the precinct already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of households.

##### a. Map - Precinct line between Director Districts F and G

#### D. RTD Boundary Certification and Director District Designation

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description.  It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:

a.       The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the Andalusia Annexation – are recommended to be included in Director District I (Director Lubow); and

b.       The Parker annexation – Todd Drive – is recommended to be included in Director District G (Director Lasater).

#### E. Resolution No. ___ Series of 2016, RTD Position on Senate Bill 16-011

#### F. Access-a-Ride Eligibility Assessments

## III. Other Matters

- Bronco Day—Director Solano shared that he is receiving calls from constituents concerned about RTD’s decision to make this a free ride day.  Their concern is we are using taxpayer’s monies to advance private enterprise.  He thinks we should have conversation with the City of Denver and the Broncos around reimbursement for the cost of providing this free transportation.  Interim General Manager Genova shared that he had made his call after consultation with his team and a concern around safety hazards that the people were creating around our buses and light rail stations.   His team is assessing the situation.  The only similar situation he can recall is an incident the last day of the Democratic National Convention.  He has asked Heather Copp, CFO, to see if she could ascertain any financial impact. Chair Tobiassen concurred this was a public safety issue.  The call was appropriately made to allow people to move.  This was a good drill for future emergency situations that might call for public transit. Director Deadwyler added she agrees with the decision but felt RTD was slighted in getting credit for what they had done to move all these people effectively and safely.  IGM Genova indicated he will be having a meeting with Mayor Hancock soon and he will certainly mention the RTD role.

- IGM Genova shared that RTD will be testifying before the House Transportation Committee February 24 on Access-a-Ride.

- IGM Genova shared that DTP had given RTD a date for when they would hand the B-Line to RTD.  That date is Monday, July 25.  We normally like to schedule our opening events on a Friday so the team is discussing how to best work with this date and the scheduled opening activities.

- Director Deadwyler inquired about the A-line opening.  IGM Genova indicated the Save the Dates had been sent.   The Committee members appeared surprised that they had not received this information.  Director Hoy shared that he had received this info as a member of a community organization.  Dave Genova indicated he would follow up on these Save the Dates for Board members.  Director Deadwyler said that she had heard that DTP was left out of these celebrations.  She thinks that would be a shame as they have done great work.  IGM Genova stated he does not think this is true as they have been a sponsoring partner for a couple of events already.  He would check into this.  IGM Genova reviewed some of the opening dates and activities for these events.

- IGM Genova shared that he and a few members of his staff had met with Councilwoman Gilmore around her concerns for some type of global ECOpass offering for the Montbello/DIA workers.  One of the ideas they had discussed was a transportation charrette coordinated by DIA to bring the various companies together in an educational forum on types of options for their employees.
