Date:

Board Meeting Date: January 20, 2015

Subject:

Radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s
Representative
Contract Seventh-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the
contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016).
This contract amendment is for the seventh year, which is an additional option year of the contract. The
scope and fee are renegotiated annually. The seventh-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $2,600,000
for a total contract value to date of $14,622,000.
BACKGROUND
RTD has replaced our radio and CAD/AVL system, which was originally implemented in 1993 and was
past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life. The project is expected to complete
System Acceptance Testing in the second quarter of 2015. There are many remaining efforts required
as a foundation for the extended operations and maintenance of the systems, processes and
infrastructure. Changes to the system are needed to improve functionality and adapt the system to
address Smart Media Technology (SMT) changes required by the new fare policy. The INIT system
provides the driver interface and onboard computer for the SMT system. Having a single interface saves
RTD money by eliminating cost and maintenance of duplicative hardware. Additionally, the extension of
this CAD/AVL system to provide Real-time Passenger Information (RTPI) to RTD’s Traveler Information
Systems (TIS) is an extremely complex and challenging task requiring experience and expertise that IBI
Group provides.
RTD requires extension of the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency
through the final stage of the project, planning for moving into operations, implementation of required
changes and design and implementation of RTPI. The OR will provide unique technical skills unavailable
internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.
This is a complex and dynamic project. IBI has successfully completed the work anticipated for the
earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to authorize a contract amendment for the seventh year of the
contract to continue needed support.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.A.1

This is the start of an optional seventh year of a Board-approved contract. Due to the complexity and
changing conditions of the project, each year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and negotiated
annually.
Although implementation for the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work remains to
complete system acceptance testing, review and finalize as-built documentation, complete planning to
move into operations and maintenance of the system, implement and test system changes such as the
SMT interface adjustments for the new fare policy. Additionally, providing real-time information to
passengers is a complex and challenging next phase for the CAD/AVL project.
The anticipated seventh-year activities are:
 Final system acceptance testing, which will extend into the second quarter of 2015
 Detailed review of project record documents
 Implementation of pending INIT contract amendments, addressing elements such as the interface
changes with SMT required for changes to fare policy
 Radio system capacity expansion for improved FasTracks and mountain coverage
 Integration and testing of subsequent phases of Smart Media Technology
 Developing scope of work for hardware replacement on Access-a-Ride buses
 Analyzing RTPI prediction accuracy and providing recommendations
 Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuation of Operations Plan (CoOP) update and implementation
 Requirements development for RTPI foundation for light rail
 Requirements development for RTPI delivery to General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)-RealTime (RT), Passenger Information Displays (PIDs), RTD website and interactive voice response
(IVR) systems
 General Intelligent Transportation System / CAD / Communications consultancy demands in
support of RTD operations and FasTrack activities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost to the District for amending the Owner’s Representative contract with IBI Group for the
seventh year is a not-to-exceed cost of $2,600,000. Funding has been included in the 2009-2015
Finance and Administration Department’s Information Technology Division capital and operating budget.
The contract values for the first six years is cumulatively $12,022,000 and with this 7th year addition
total award is $14,622,000.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the request for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement Project Owner’s Representative
contract amendment which will reduce risk and allow current RTD employees to continue
focusing on operating and improving the system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Attempt to accomplish the project with in-house staff. RTD staff does not have the necessary
skills or available resources to undertake this project.
If the IBI agreement is not approved and these resources are not available, the project would proceed
with a combination of Work Order contractors and RTD staff. It is likely that Alternative 2 will incur
additional cost for another vendor’s learning curve.

Long-Term Funding
§ Effective with the 2013 Fiscal Year, the Board-approved funding policy was
changed from a percent of payroll (9% cap) to the recommended contribution
amount up to a $3.1M annual cap
Ø Current funding policy is more prudent given the Plan’s decreasing active population
and resulting reduction in future expected payroll
Ø This policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding by the end of
20 years (in 2033)

§ If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment return
of 7.5% per year, and annual contributions equal the recommended
contribution up to a $3.1M annual cap:
Ø The recommended contribution is projected to decrease from $5.7M in the 2015
Fiscal Year
Ø The recommended contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1M cap through the
2022 Fiscal Year and fall below the cap thereafter
Ø The Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031 – no change from last year’s
Board presentation

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ Per the investment consultant, the estimated 2014 return on investments
through November 30th is 7.6% (net of fees)
Ø If the net return in 2014 is 7%, the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031
(no change), and RTD can expect to pay the $3.1M contribution cap through the
2023 Fiscal Year (1 year later), if all other assumptions are met

§ Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant
impact on projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of
the Plan’s investment performance on future costs

§ GASB 67 (financial accounting for the Plan) is effective for the Plan’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2014
Ø We will roll forward the January 1, 2014 valuation results to December 31, 2014
Ø Under GASB standards, the long-term investment return assumption must be
sufficient to pay projected benefits and the Plan’s assets must be invested using a
strategy to achieve this investment return
•

Based on the Plan’s projections and current funding policy, the Plan’s assumed net
investment return of 7.5% satisfies the new GASB standards

§ GASB 68 (financial accounting for the Employer) is effective for RTD’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2015
§ We will provide the applicable disclosure information for the Fiscal Year ending
December 31, 2014 (GASB 67 for the Plan and GASB 27 for the Employer) in

Ã If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment

return of 7.0% per year, and annual contributions equal those stated in the
tentative agreement:
• Assets will be fully depleted by 2036

Ã Per the investment consultant, the estimated 2014 investments return is 4%
• Incorporating this into the above projections, assets will be fully depleted by 2035
• To reach 100% funding by 2044, assets would need to earn 15% per year through 2020

Ã In 2014, Society of Actuaries released new mortality tables
• Current tables based on national data up to year 2000, new tables based on data to 2014
• New tables assume members will live longer than under current tables
• Future valuations will eventually need to move to new tables or a more conservative

assumption than currently used; will increase normal cost and liabilities

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 7, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 7, 2015

Board Meeting Date: January 20, 2015

Subject:

City of Boulder Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at
Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for
an amount not to exceed $1,459,687.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,459,687.00 in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will
confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through 3rd Quarter in 2014 resulted in 28.7 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP
passenger trip of $1.66. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2012 ranged
from an average of 34.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per
hour for suburban local service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service so

2.

that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

Board Meeting Date: January 20, 2015

Subject:

5311 Cost Share Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2015 and for amounts
not to exceed $353,990.00 for Boulder County, $348,398.00 for Adams County and $107,948.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Since
1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of
transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal
grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $353,990.00 in 2015. RTD shall also contribute
funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in
amount not to exceed $348,398.00 in 2015.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $107,948.00. in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will
confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311 service in 2014
(current numbers available) resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.7 to 2.5 passengers
per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $2.01 to
approximately $4.63 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride
monthly performance averaged 4.4 passengers per hour in 2012 while RTD Access-a-Ride service

Denver Regional Council of
Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

Governments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is
for calendar year 2015 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $760,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service has grown
from 11 to 105 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool

2.A.3

program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.9 riders per van and the fleet is at 80% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2014 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $2.36. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2012
ranged from an average of $2.88 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.61
subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.22 subsidy per passenger for
regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2015 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

A-Line Cost Share

BACKGROUND
In February of 2003, the RTD Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of service on the skyRide
Route AS beyond the Stapleton transfer station due to low ridership at the Olde Town Arvada and Ward
Road park-n-Rides. As a result of this action, interested parties in the City of Arvada developed a
business plan to implement scheduled shuttle van service to be operated directly between the Olde
Town Arvada park-n-ride and Denver International Airport (DIA). The proposed business plan called for
the provision of scheduled shuttle van service, the A-Line, to be operated between Arvada and DIA. This
service was implemented May 11, 2003 to coincide with the elimination of AS service to Arvada.
DISCUSSION
The A-Line service, operated by Ride Provide, was specifically created to fill the void left by the Route
AS. Ride Provide has proved to be a reliable, consistent and efficient transportation provider. The A-Line
will operate until the Gold Line and East Line are in place and can provide an airport service to the
community.
FY2009 boardings – 35,350; passengers per hour – 3.1; subsidy per passenger - $4.64.
FY2010 boardings – 37,302; passengers per hour – 3.3; subsidy per passenger - $4.54.
FY2011 boardings – 40,028; passengers per hour – 3.5; subsidy per passenger - $4.22.
FY2012 boardings – 42,323; passengers per hour – 3.9; subsidy per passenger - $3.99.
FY2013 boardings – 47,469; passengers per hour – 4.2; subsidy per passenger - $3.66.
FY2014 boardings (thru 3rd qtr) – 40,638; passengers per hour – 4.8; subsidy per passenger - $3.29.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of this agreement are included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. This
agreement is for calendar year 2015 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $183,585.00.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend

BACKGROUND
These agreements are currently approved by the General Manager. This report has been generated for
informational purposes only.
DISCUSSION
Littleton Shopping Cart $29,375 for 2015. Since January 1992, the RTD has contributed to support
the Littleton Shopping Cart which was originated to serve portions of certain routes previously served by
RTD. The Shopping Cart is a free service available to the residents of Littleton. FY2014 (thru 3 rd Qtr)
boardings = 8,008; passengers per hour = 6.3.
Focus Points Family Resource Center (FPFRC) $50,676 for 2015. In January 2004, the RTD
discontinued the Route 47 and as an alternative the RTD entered into an agreement for a local non-profit
to provide a new community based service. FPFRC has long been an advocate and resource for
communities in Denver. FY2014 boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) = 1876; passengers per hour = 2.6.
Longmont Coordination of Services $10,600 for 2015. In January 2010, Via Mobility, a nonprofit
organization, applied for and received a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century New Freedom
grant to coordinate transportations services provided by Via Mobility and RTD in the city of Longmont.
Currently Via Mobility and RTD are now coordinating services between all Via and Call-n-Ride trips and
Access-a-Ride trips that can be operated on Via and Call-n-Ride services. Local matches of the grant will
be provided by Via Mobility, the City of Longmont and the RTD.

Proposed May 2015 Service Change

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. The proposal regarding the
cancellation of the Route DD and reduction in frequency on the Light Rail W- Line are
ridership/performance based and in accord with RTD Service Standards. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Change to summer schedules
Light Rail
C-Line
It is proposed to adjust the clock headway pattern of the C-Line in the AM and PM peak periods
on Mondays through Fridays and have trips leaving 6 minutes later northbound and 9 minutes
earlier southbound. This will create a smoother headway of trains on the Southwest Line, where
there will be a train (C or D) every 6 or 9 minutes, more evenly spaced than today. This also
opens up the opportunity to increase headways on the E-Line, which currently shares open slots
with the C-Line. No operating hours savings or additions are anticipated with this change.

Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
Weekday schedule adjustments to improve on time performance. No cost impacts
anticipated.

2.B.3.a

E-Line
It is proposed to add one peak round-trip train in the AM and PM peak (6:54 AM from Lincoln
Station, 7:44 AM from Union Station, 4:09 PM from Lincoln Station, and 4:58 PM from Union
Station) and to assist with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W-Line
transfers. This takes advantage of the altered C-Line schedule, creates a 15-minute frequency for
half an hour in each peak period, and is a test to determine the feasibility of adding more 15minute headway E-Line service in the future.
Cost impacts are estimated to be $235,875 annualized.
It is also proposed to discontinue the 4:33 AM northbound trip from Lincoln Station Mondays
through Fridays. An F-Line trips runs ahead of this train and a C-Line pullout to Union Station will
be adjusted to maintain the connection to Union Station and the W-Line. 20 passengers will be
affected by this change. Savings are estimated to be $70,750 annualized.
Additionally, it is proposed to adjust the clock headway pattern of the E-Line in the AM and PM
peak periods in the reverse peak directions (southbound in the AM, northbound in the PM) on
Mondays through Fridays, to coincide with the C-Line schedule adjustments. Trains will be
scheduled 15 minutes earlier/later than they are now. Two trips will be filled with additional ELine trains. No operating hours savings or additions are anticipated with this change.
H-Line
It is proposed to discontinue the 4:32 AM northbound trip from Nine Mile Station on Sundays and
Holidays. This affects 40 passengers. Savings are estimated to be $16,100 annualized.
W-Line
It is proposed to add a base train in the W-Line schedule to improve service reliability, increase
operator recovery time and allow for midday car cuts at Jefferson County Government CenterGolden Station. No impact to the public schedule besides adjustment in the early morning and
late night trips, plus an additional in-service pullout train in the early morning.
Cost impacts are estimated to be $1,330,335 annualized.
It is also proposed to discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods:
Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 7:01 AM, 7:31 AM, 8:01 AM, 3:31 PM, 4:46 PM,
5:16 PM, 5:46 PM, and 7:01 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:41 AM, 7:11 AM,
7:41 AM, 2:41 PM, 4:26 PM, 4:56 PM, 5:26 PM, and 6:11 PM. This service reduction would
result in the W-Line having a peak period frequency similar to that of the D-Line (10-15 minutes),
but still more frequent than all other individual light rail lines currently operating in the RTD
system. This proposed change effects approximately 789 passengers that will need to take a WLine 7.5 minutes earlier or later. Additionally, a third car will be added to the busiest W-Line peak
period trips.

This affects 53 passengers. Savings estimated to be $639,000 annualized
Union Station Hostlers
It is proposed to cancel the Saturday and Sunday Union Station hostlers and reduce the additional
Monday-Friday Union Station hostler work, in concert with the W-Line improvements. Savings are
estimated to be $693,750 annualized.
Light Rail School Trippers
The D-Line and H-Line school trippers, train 14 and 57, Mondays through Thursdays, will
be canceled for the summer as per traditional practice. This includes the northbound DLine trip at Mineral Station at 7:13 AM and the northbound H-Line trip at 7:12 AM.

Attachment: Fare Study -Jan Board Update 010615 Final (2204 : Fare Task Force Update)

What we Heard: Types of Service
• Four types are better than current system
• Zoned rail fares:
– Most passengers do not like the existing
zones and prefer the single rail fare

• Suggestions to combine types of service
for pricing levels
– Rail and Local Bus
– Regional Bus and Airport

• A few individuals would prefer a distance
based structure for the whole system
• Split opinion on charging more for DIA

Attachment: Fare Study -Jan Board Update 010615 Final (2204 : Fare Task Force Update)

2.B.4.a

What we Heard: Pay per Boarding
• Simpler system
• Potential for passengers who need to
transfer to pay more for their trip
– Concerns that this could impact low income
passengers

• Cash paying customers could increase
dwell times
• Difficult to enforce on rail
• Day pass is desirable
7
Packet Pg. 61

What we Heard: Pay for Time
• Simpler than the current system since it
eliminates the round-tripping transfer
restriction
• Does not solve operator/customer
disputes about transfer time windows
• Concerns about service delays cutting into
the time window
• Three hours is too short
• Option would overcharge riders for short
trips

Attachment: Fare Study -Jan Board Update 010615 Final (2204 : Fare Task Force Update)

What we Heard: General
• Keep monthly and other pass programs
• Expand smart card program
• Desire for a low-income pass (or major
improvements to existing non-profit agency
reduced fare program)
• Why are fares necessary if we already pay
for RTD with taxes?
• Desire for a day pass with either payment
option

• Difficult to evaluate these options
without pricing

Packet Pg. 63

RTD Task Force Discussions:
Bus Service
• Two types of bus service are desirable
– Regional service could be called “REX” and
priced closer to current Express service
– REX service classified by type of operation (few
stops and higher operating speed)
– Current Express routes will be moved to
Local/Limited or REX category based on travel
time and operating speed
– On REX service passengers pay REX fare
independent of trip length
– Goal to match vehicle to type of service (i.e. over
the road coach = REX)

2.B.4.a

RTD Task Force Discussions:
Rail
• Elimination of zones is simpler
– Improves enforcement and customer
education
– Could improve parking supply utilization
– Best to set Rail fare equivalent to Local bus

• Airport surcharge
– Ideal to have bus and rail to the airport priced
at the same level
– Airport surcharge requires enforcement of a
“zone” but still simpler than current four zones

2.B.4.a

RTD Task Force Discussions:
Payment Options
• Preference for pay per
boarding with a low-priced
day pass available on the
bus
– Price day pass to minimize
impact of the change on
passengers who make
transfers
– Day pass is easier to enforce
than current transfers or a
three-hour ticket

TriMet recently added ticket printers on
their buses to sell 2-Hour tickets or day
passes

Updated Project Schedule
• Board decision on fare structure will be combined
with pricing levels based on public feedback
• February – staff to present revenue analysis and
proposals for structure and levels
• March – Board approves public hearings for fare
structure and levels in March/April
• May – Board approval of fare structure and levels
• May approval supports goal of implementing
policies in early 2016 in advance of new
FasTracks corridors

Packet Pg. 67

Next Steps
• Analysis to include “revenue neutral” fare
levels
• Develop a structural/fare proposal by
February
– Identify both “revenue neutral” ($119M) and
Board approved Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
target revenue level ($131M) for comparison
– Develop proposals for fare levels that correspond
to the Board approved 2016 SBP fare revenue
target ($131M)
– Note that revenue neutral pricing would require
service reductions
