PEGGY CATLIN: Director Mihalik. Did I already say Cook? Director Cook. Director Walker.
Director Whitmore and Director Menten. Also on the line we have John McKay, Barbara
McManus, Bob Ballard, and we have Gregg Moser on the line. I think I captured everyone.
So our first candidate will be joining us shortly. And we will adjourn-- or I'll take a motion to
adjourn to executive session, but we might want to give it a minute or two. Bear in mind that we
need to log in to a separate meeting after we adjourn this open meeting.
KATE WILLIAMS: We're missing the Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: We are missing the Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
SHELLEY COOK: Do we technically adjourn or do we pause this part of the meeting and then
we return to it at the end?
PEGGY CATLIN: We can pause this part and return to it. Yeah, we do have to return to it after
we exit the executive session.
KATE WILLIAMS: And just FYI, you can turn it off and then go back to the same place on your
calendar and click on it, and it will take you right back to it. That's what I did yesterday. I turned
this one off completely, went on to the next one so my bandwidth would be OK. And then when
we were finished, I turned that off and came back here, and it worked fine.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's probably a good idea. Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: --the hint from others, including John McKay has been very helpful. I'm
going to have Teams down by the time we interview our next General Manager.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's right. [LAUGHS] Troy.
KATE WILLIAMS: So I'm going to move-- should I move that we adjourn to the regular
meeting?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I need to read the-KATE WILLIAMS: Read your thing.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I did pull a copy of it. But Paul Ballard, you were really good at helping
out yesterday when I fumbled. You're good at recovering those fumbles.

Do I have a motion?
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved. Director Williams.
PEGGY CATLIN: Is there a second?
SHELLEY COOK: I'll second. Shelley Cook.
PEGGY CATLIN: Shelley Cook. And welcome, Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am.
PEGGY CATLIN: Are there any opposed to moving into executive session?
[INTERFERENCE NOISES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --have Director Lewis on the line.
[INTERFERENCE NOISES]
KATE WILLIAMS: We have some serious interference here, if anybody can hear me. So it's
either Angie or Shontel.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Nope, not me.
SHONTEL LEWIS: It's not me. I've actually been on the line for some time. It's not me.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, it's not me. I'm just on my computer.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
Oh, it's gone.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's gone.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, we are hereby adjourned. Or we are moving into executive session, we
are not adjourned. And so if you would exit this Teams meeting and rejoin the other one, that
will-- and we will convene--
