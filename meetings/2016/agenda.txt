C. Approval of Contract Award to Kiewit Infrastructure Company for the Design,
Construction and Financial Solution of the I-225 Rail Line Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors (“Board”) authorize the General Manager to award the
design build contract and negotiate final terms for a financial solution
agreement with Kiewit Infrastructure Company to serve as the Contractor for
the I-225 Rail Line Project (“Project”). The Project consisting of a portion of I225 Rail Line from the Nine Mile Station to Peoria Station, which will be
constructed for a lump sum amount of US$350 million, to be financed in
accordance with the terms of the final financial agreement.
Acceptance of this proposal would complete the entire I-225 corridor and
provides major benefits to RTD, its FasTracks program and the region.


It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the
FasTracks program. It also provides a favorable capital cost. The
commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a later
time (due to current economic conditions and the fact that parts of the
team are already mobilized for RTD’s DUS project).



This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to
seek innovative approaches to delivering the program.



Receipt of two solid proposals and successful award of the contract
demonstrates the private sector’s interest in investing in another RTD project
and speaks to the agency’s respect in the industry. It also continues to
encourage the pursuit of similar proposals on other projects.



Completion of this I-225 corridor maximizes mobility for military veterans
and their dependents seeking medical care at the soon-to-be completed
Regional Veterans Administration Hospital, transit dependents both
temporary and long–term, to key job centers and has a high measure of

cost effectiveness per rider providing clean, safe, reliable, accessible and
cost effective transportation in keeping with RTD’s overall mission.


This extension serves the key employment and regional destination of the
Fitzsimons Medical Campus, which includes the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center, Children’s Hospital and the soon-to-be completed
Veterans Administration Regional Hospital which will serve the seven state
Rocky Mountain region and provide medical services to approximately
57,000 military veterans on an annual basis.



The complete extension connects with the East Corridor (between Denver
Union Station and Denver International Airport) at Peoria Station and
provides regional connectivity to a major portion of the metro area.



Projected ridership is 34,400 riders per day by 2035.



Capitalizes on the high level of interest from the business community who are
seeking innovative ways to partner with RTD to complete the I-225 corridor.
