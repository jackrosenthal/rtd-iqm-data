Chair Kemp called the meeting to order at 5:35 p.m. Prior to the start of the
meeting, Chair Kemp called for a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the
Aurora Century Theater tragedy.

II.

Roll Call
There were fourteen (14) Board members present at roll call. Director Williams was
absent.

III.

Public Participation: I-225 Unsolicited Proposal
Honorable Mayor Joyce Downing with the City of Northglenn, spoke on behalf of
the NATA group. Mayor Downing introduced other members of this alliance and
stated NATA is composed of 11 government groups representing the NE quadrant.
Their primary priority is transportation. They are in support of the I-225 proposal
but the next priority has to be the north area. They would like the Board to assign a
formal committee to work with the north metro to ensure that what was promised
for the north is delivered. Some of the requests included:
1.

2.

The Board commits to utilize all available resources RTD has to make real and
usable transit investments in the north area before devoting resources to
extending corridors that already have service. Those resources include: a)
utilizing available bonding capacity; b) utilizing federal grant and loan programs;
c) engaging private sector funding; d) determining the amount of cash available
to leverage other available resources and providing that information in a
transparent and open environment; and e) working with its member jurisdictions
to allow RTD to capture the additional sales tax proceeds that RTD currently
isn’t receiving as a result of statutory structure.
The Board commits to pledge any cost savings associated with I-225, EAGLE
P3, and the other funded corridors to the north area to provide real and
meaningful improvements to the unfunded corridors.

5.

The Board commits to directing its staff to devote time and resources to work
with North Metro and the Northwest transit corridor jurisdictions to create an
action plan that can be the basis for the DRCOG 2035 Regional Transportation
Plan amendment.
The Board commits to developing a viable plan to extend Phase 1 of the North
Metro Corridor to 72nd Avenue by 2018.
The Board commits to working with the jurisdictions in the Northwest transit
corridor to develop viable transit improvements.

Chair Kemp recognized Honorable Mayor Steve Hogan of Aurora who had appeared but
did not desire to speak.
Debra Baskett, City and County of Broomfield, provided their support for the $15M for
the second phase of the US 36 managed lane project.
Michael Gifford, President of the Associated General Contractors of Colorado, an
organization representing 360 members of commercial builders, and general
contractors, stated their support for the I-225 proposal and gave three reasons for this
support:
 There has been a drastic economic impact on construction since 2006
downturn. We have lost a number of jobs that may not ever be recovered.
We need to put these workers back to work.
 Economic development effort-good public transportation is one of the
reasons why companies will come to Colorado. Transit access is important
to our ability to attract new companies.
 Today is a good time to achieve cost savings especially if we do not have to
re-mobilize the workers and can keep the continuity. This is a good time to
do projects like this.
Rich Himmel, candidate for the RTD Board of directors for Thornton, expressed
grave disappointment in how FasTracks has been managed especially in the north.
He stated that the RTD Board has ignored the needs of this community and that
residents are very angry. We need to re-kindle public trust which will involve
reselling RTD and providing the real costs for the FasTracks project. This is what he
intends to do if elected to the Board.
Karen Stewart, Executive director for The Smart Commute, a metro North TMO,
supports the Kiewit proposal. She stated some of the expressed benefits for the I225 corridor in terms of public access and stated that the north metro could also
benefit from the same. She asked for reassurance that the I-225 project would not
consume all the funding and resources so that the north might benefit from some
funding to mobilize their efforts.
Barry Gore, ACED, provided his support for the I-225 unsolicited proposal. He
spoke of the role Adams County play as a hub for the north region. He stated an
investment in the NW rail and north metro is important to remain competitive. He
cited one company, US Patent and Trade, where an opportunity was lost because of
lack of rail service. He asked that consideration be given to the NW and north

Minutes of the Special Board Meeting held Tuesday, July 24, 2012

metro corridors as the priority for next in line.
Gene Putnam, transportation planner for the City of Thornton, expressed it was a
good moment to see the plan for the completion of the I-225 corridor. He shared
that the north metro was the first corridor to receive an unsolicited proposal that
was deemed unacceptable. He petitioned Kiewit to look at the north metro as a
viable candidate for an unsolicited proposal. The north metro area needs a catalyst
to encourage the development of which there is much interest. He shared the story
of his daughter who moved to the SE where rail is currently available. He asked RTD
to prioritize the north area so we can “bring his daughter back home.”
Ed Slattery expressed some concerns over the routing loop for trains from the I-225
corridor into downtown Denver. He spoke about the concept of joint routing or the
interlining that consists of routing a train from one branch to the downtown end of a
trunk so that it can reverse to return onto a different branch. Because it allows an
odd number of trains to serve lines that otherwise would have to be operated as
two separate routes, where an even number would have otherwise been required
for service at the usual number of minutes conveniently recurring after each hour, it
has been the main form of interlining for many sees (i.e. see Winnipeg system. He
believes this is a routing alternative that should be considered for the I-225.
Erica Kampe, Denver, is the program manager for Transportations Solution. She
expressed their support for the I-225 Unsolicited proposal and stated two things
that the BOD report did not speak to: timeline and consideration for opening the Iliff
leg ahead of the rest of the corridor.

C. Approval of Contract Award to Kiewit Infrastructure Company for the Design,

Minutes of the Special Board Meeting held Tuesday, July 24, 2012
Page 6 of 9

Construction and Financial Solution of the I-225 Rail Line Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors (“Board”) authorize the General Manager to award the
design build contract and negotiate final terms for a financial solution
agreement with Kiewit Infrastructure Company to serve as the Contractor for
the I-225 Rail Line Project (“Project”). The Project consisting of a portion of I225 Rail Line from the Nine Mile Station to Peoria Station, which will be
constructed for a lump sum amount of US$350 million, to be financed in
accordance with the terms of the final financial agreement.
Acceptance of this proposal would complete the entire I-225 corridor and
provides major benefits to RTD, its FasTracks program and the region.


It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the
FasTracks program. It also provides a favorable capital cost. The
commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a later
time (due to current economic conditions and the fact that parts of the
team are already mobilized for RTD’s DUS project).



This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to
seek innovative approaches to delivering the program.



Receipt of two solid proposals and successful award of the contract
demonstrates the private sector’s interest in investing in another RTD project
and speaks to the agency’s respect in the industry. It also continues to
encourage the pursuit of similar proposals on other projects.



Completion of this I-225 corridor maximizes mobility for military veterans
and their dependents seeking medical care at the soon-to-be completed
Regional Veterans Administration Hospital, transit dependents both
temporary and long–term, to key job centers and has a high measure of
cost effectiveness per rider providing clean, safe, reliable, accessible and
cost effective transportation in keeping with RTD’s overall mission.



This extension serves the key employment and regional destination of the
Fitzsimons Medical Campus, which includes the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center, Children’s Hospital and the soon-to-be completed
Veterans Administration Regional Hospital which will serve the seven state
Rocky Mountain region and provide medical services to approximately
57,000 military veterans on an annual basis.



The complete extension connects with the East Corridor (between Denver
Union Station and Denver International Airport) at Peoria Station and
provides regional connectivity to a major portion of the metro area.



Projected ridership is 34,400 riders per day by 2035.



Capitalizes on the high level of interest from the business community who are
seeking innovative ways to partner with RTD to complete the I-225 corridor.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to

Minutes of the Special Board Meeting held Tuesday, July 24, 2012
Page 7 of 9
approve the contract award to Kiewit
Infrastructure Company for the design,
construction and financial solution of the I225 rail line project.
Discussion:

Director Malpiede seconded the motion.

Director Hoy commented on the large constituency base from the north area and the
concerns that they had expressed for the north metro. Nevertheless, they were willing to
provide their support for the I-225 corridor. This took a lot of courage since this proposal
puts north metro in a less than desirable position. The Board need to continue to support
the north metro area in every way possible including a commitment that north metro will be
the next priority. This will be an admirable gesture from the Board considering the sacrifice
of the north metro region.
Director Hoy stated his willingness to work with the stakeholders, business leaders and
others to further the case for the north metro options.
Director Tayer spoke on behalf of the NW corridor. There needs to be a continued
commitment to the operation of a true BRT system for that corridor. He does not want to
obstruct regional progress and he supports the I-225 unsolicited proposal. This will bring
many benefits to the region and provide significant economic opportunities. He would like
to see the development of these opportunities across the full region including the NW
corridor. He stated that RTD needs to keep its commitment to the NW corridor for a full
build out of the FasTracks system.
Director Anderson thanked everyone for coming and shared she had worked with a number
of them for years. She talked about the process over the last twenty years and her
dedication to get FasTracks built. Her observation is the numbers do work. That same
process has provided funding for the completion of the West Corridor, the Eagle P-3, and
now the I-225 proposal. Both the Gold Line and the I-225 will run through Adams County
with a station at Pecos. We have had a groundbreaking in Westminster. While it might
look like the end of the line for the north metro residents, assuredly this is not what it is.
Year ago we did not know how we would complete the I-225 corridor but with the
unsolicited proposal, it has moved up in the queue. The same thing can happen for north
metro. We are working on a commitment to get north metro extended to 72nd. However,
this is extremely costly due to the infrastructure in that area. We will look to continue to
work with that community for options.
Director McMullen stated that after 8 years on the Board, this is a special moment. He is
disappointed that we do not have the funds to do it all. This I-225 proposal is a big step. It
will allow us to provide access to one of the biggest employment centers in this region.
FasTracks is on track. We are getting it done. He pledged his commitment as an advocate
until the full region is complete. Each Director on the Board is pro-FasTracks. He reflected
on how quickly things change. The economy is coming back. Jobs are being created and
more will be created since FasTracks is an economic engine that will generate even more
opportunities from the Anschutz campus.
Chair Kemp also thanked the constituents from the north who had attended the meeting.

Minutes of the Special Board Meeting held Tuesday, July 24, 2012

He stated his respect to them for giving their support for the I-225 proposal. He believes
that getting the I-225 proposal done can be a catalyst for the north metro area as well.

Other Matters
 Chair Kemp reported that RTD will be receiving an award by the White
House for Innovative Champion of Change. This award will be presented to
the General Manager on July 31st. Along with the General Manager, Chair
Kemp, Director Malpiede, Rick Clarke, Bill Van Meter and Sherry Ellebracht
will be in attendance.
General Manager Washington added this award presented by the White
House is a reflection on the RTD organization as a whole. He noted that at
the COMTO plenary session where FTA Administrator Rogoff spoke, he
mentioned to a crowd of about 400 people that RTD would be the recipient
of this award. This award is about implementing innovative change and RTD
has certainly done that. The I-225 unsolicited proposal is just the latest in
innovations.
Adjournment
The meeting adjourned at 6:24 p.m. to the Study Session.

Paula Perdue, Executive Director of the RTD Board of Directors
