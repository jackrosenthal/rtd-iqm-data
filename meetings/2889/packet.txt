2019 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects a decrease
of $12.1 million from the 2019 Adopted Budget to $743.3 million. This change consists of a decrease
of $7.6 million on the Base System, a decrease of $27.3 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and
an increase of $22.8 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $7.6 million decrease for the Base System, budget reductions of $13.6 million were made,
consisting of intentional reductions by departments in various line items in order to balance the MTFP
and expense carryforward reductions, offset by previously approved transfers and amended budget
increases. Increases to the amended budget consist primarily of $0.8 million for increased processing
fees for mobile ticketing associated with increased mobile ticketing sales, $0.6 million for audits of IT
licenses, $0.5 million for rail repair at 16th & Stout and 16th & California due to ground settling under the
active rail traffic, $0.4 million additional funding for repair of pavers on 16th Street Mall due to harsh
weather, $0.4 million increased cost of custodial and snow removal contracts for SERE and R Line (to be
allocated to FasTracks), $0.4 million for new contracted rate for armed security, $0.2 million for a cost
increase for continuing same level of snow removal for 2019, and $1.2 million to replenish the $5.0
million contingency fund.
For FasTracks Project, the $27.3 million decrease consists of corrections for duplicate carryforward in
launch marketing, misalignment in modeling and operational analysis funds, reductions and/or
realignment in capitalized salaries, adjustments to project budgets, as well as transfer of the FasTracks
service increase funds from FasTracks Project to FasTracks Operations.
For FasTracks Operations, the $22.8 million increase consists primarily of restored funding for 2018
underspend in the North Metro project, and transfer of the FasTracks service increase funds from
FasTracks Project to FasTracks Operations.
Major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses are summarized by department below (summary
excludes previously approved transfers and expense projects carry-forward unless noted), shown in
detail on the attached Amendment A.

Increase of $3.8 million for restored funds for cost underrun in 2018 for North Metro reallocated to
professional training and outside services, and $0.5 million for true-up to the escalation index of
oversight payment to DTP, and PUC administrative fee

Non-Departmental
Increase of $0.5 million for true-up of cost allocation from Base System to FasTracks, offset by increase
of $18.9 million to transfer FasTracks service allocation (from Base System) from FT Project to FT
Operations
Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget. Debt
principal payments also will not change. This is due to the absence of debt refundings/issuances since
the Adopted Budget. Capitalized interest also is expected to show no change. On FasTracks, interest
expense is budgeted to remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not
change. Capitalized interest also is expected to remain the same. No new financing will be issued
during the remainder of 2019 for either Base System or FasTracks.
2019 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $92.6 million, consisting of $51.2
million for Base System and $41.4 million for FasTracks. The combined increase over the 2019
Adopted Budget new capital is $2.6 million. These changes result from program changes that have
occurred since the 2019 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
Total new capital is $51.2 million for the Base System. New capital changes for Base System result in a
net increase of $0.9 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. This adjustment to new capital
funding since the 2019 Adopted Budget is funding for an upgrade to the existing visual messaging
system and public announcement system at Mariposa Light Rail Division to address cybersecurity and
safety requirements. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
Total new capital is $41.4 million for FasTracks (Project). New capital changes for FasTracks result in a
net increase of $1.8 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. This results from updated project
schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2019 and changes in cost
estimates (SERE, North Metro). Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2019 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/18 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2019 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/18 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2018.

Packet Pg. 30

11.A

Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $579.5 million, a decrease of $140.0 million from
the 2019 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2018 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved transfers,
project scope changes, deferrals to 2020, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward amount, the
Base System portion is $98.7 million and the FasTracks portion is $480.8 million. Major capital
carryforward projects are 16th Street Mall Paver Repair, Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project, purchase
of 27 LRVs, North Metro rail construction, and close-out for East Corridor, SERE, Northwest Rail, R and
Gold Line. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $18.0 million on a combined basis from the
2019 Adopted Budget.









Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $5.9 million from the 2019 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March 2019 forecast. The 2019 Amended Budget
incorporates the baseline forecast of 4.4% over 2018 sales/use tax revenue. The 2019 Adopted
Budget used the CU-Leeds September 2018 baseline forecast which called for a 5.6% increase
over the then projected 2018 level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to decline $12.3 million
from amounts in the 2019 Adopted Budget. On the Base System, grant revenue is projected to
decrease $7.8 million from decreases in CMAQ Funding, 5339 Bus funding, fixed guideway
SOGR 5337 funding, Stamps and FASTER grants, offset by increases in 5307 capital
maintenance grants. For FasTracks, grants are budgeted to decrease $4.4 million due to
decreases in Stamps grants and lower carryforward on SERE grants, offset by increases in CMAQ
grants.
o Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to decrease $28.8 million
due to reductions in third-party betterments and project contributions on the R Line and
Eagle project.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to remain unchanged in the 2019 Amended Budget for both Base
System and FasTracks. We will revise our estimates in the 2020 budget based on more months
of actual data. Of projected fare revenue of $163.6 million, $125.3 million is attributed to the
Base System and $38.3 million is attributed to FasTracks (Operations). Fare revenue is
forecasted on the basis of a fare change proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and
adopted by the Board. A fare model is being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue between
Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors, and which takes into account
ridership decline. Using this model, in 2019 a higher proportionate amount of fare revenue is
allocated to FasTracks and a lower amount is allocated to Base System than in previous periods.
Investment income is budgeted unchanged from the 2019 Adopted Budget.
Other income is budgeted slightly higher from the 2019 Adopted Budget. Miscellaneous amounts
are reallocated from Base System to FasTracks.

Although the primary sources of revenue are budgeted to remain flat or decline, other sources of funding
are anticipated to materialize or have done so to support the budgeted increases in operating expenses.
These include: 1) reduction in both capital and expense carryforward from the adopted budget, 2) offset
of requested amended budget items with unused funds elsewhere in departmental budgets, 3) release of
unspent funds from closure of capital projects, 4) intentional reduction to 2019 budgeted operating
expenses, 5) deferral of expenditures post-2019, and 6) use of contingency fund. Capital expenditures

Packet Pg. 31

11.A

(on-going and carry-forward) in 2019 will be funded by previously issued debt proceeds and previously
identified project funding.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $38.9 million from the
Adopted Budget to $19.3 million reflecting the funding sources and uses described above, net of
amended budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, replenishment of the operating reserve fund,
and increases to reserves per fund balance policy. More importantly, the unrestricted year-end fund
balance for the Base System is restated on a cash basis in the amended budget (and going forward) to
match the cash basis unrestricted year-end fund balance in the Base System MTFP.
FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $0.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
its purpose is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the FasTracks schedule without
requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The
FasTracks Internal Savings Account is budgeted at $84.9 million. These project reserve balances remain
unchanged from the 2019 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2019 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2019 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2019 Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 32

11.A

Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2019
Amended Budget, to decrease the appropriation by $49.1 million to $1.267 billion, and to decrease
the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $140.0 million to
$579.5 million as detailed above in the Discussion section of this report.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2019 Adopted Budget and amend the
budget with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2019 Adopted Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2019 Adopted
Budget does not reflect the necessary capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments,
and material changes to the operating and administrative budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: July 2, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

July 2, 2019

Board Meeting Date: July 16, 2019

Subject:

Award of “Group 29” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Transdev for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 29.” This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$85,326,407.00; the option year 1 amount is $30,560,167.00; and the option year 2 amount is
$31,742,845.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $147,629,420.00. In
addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be
$9,614,906.00 for the initial 3-year contract term; $3,356,141.00 for option year 1; and
$3,435,828.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is
$16,406,875.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit
service and fuel is $164,036,295.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On February 26, 2019, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 19-DH-009 named “Group 29” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 29” service package
replaces “Group 25”, which will expire in 2020. The service package consists of 111 buses
operating 36 routes providing approximately 340,371 revenue hours per year. A summary of the
routes included in “Group 29” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals
were due on April 26, 2019. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for
providing fixed-route service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided
transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated
to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

12.B

DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 19-DH-009 to provide “Group 29” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 12, 2020.
PROCUREMENT:
Two (2) proposals were received from Transdev and First Transit in response to RFP 19-DH-009 for
the Provision of “Group 29” Public Transportation Services. Both proposals were evaluated on the
following evaluative criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%);
b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal
attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and
safety record. The technical evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager,
Contracted Services; Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services; Steve Gieske, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Loradeane Clinkenbeard, Manager, Bus Operator Training; and Erin
Vallejos, Technician, Contracted Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Brittany Eroen, Compliance Officer,
SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored the Procurement Department staff.
“GROUP 29” PROPOSALS:
Transdev - The following is a summary of the strong points of the Transdev “Group 29” proposal
which support the recommendation of contract award to Transdev:
Facility. Located at 2775 S. Vallejo Street Englewood, CO 80110 which is on the west side of the
Denver metro area and is centrally located within the “Group 29” service area. The facility is fully
functional and its location does not require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times
to get to bus route terminals.
Bus Operator Wages. Transdev’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage will increase from $18.47/hour to $19.80/hour (RTD starting wage for
operators will be $20.58/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels.
RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining
qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide Transdev the opportunity to offer a
more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators and result in
improved service for our passengers.
Mechanic Wages. Transdev’s proposal provides an increase in mechanic wages. The Transdev C
level mechanic wage will increase from $21.67/ to $22.32/hour (RTD starting wage for an entry
level mechanic will be $26.08/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other mechanic wage
levels. The proposed wage increases will provide Transdev the opportunity to offer a more attractive
wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of mechanics.
Dedicated On-site Recruiter. This new full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of
bus operators and maintenance personnel for the Transdev location.

Packet Pg. 55

12.B

Enhanced Quality Control. Transdev will track all performance metrics captured through Trapeze,
Webrisk, MMIS and SmartDive to monitor, maintain and if necessary improve performance under all
RTD Board of Director adopted performance measures.
Maintenance Program. Transdev will add an on-site Diagnostics Training Manager dedicated to
providing additional training for mechanics. Transdev will accomplish this through a maintenance
training lab which will provide real time and virtual training ensuring technicians are equipped to
diagnose and address all maintenance repairs. All mechanics will receive 60 hours of initial training
when hired and 40 hours of refresher training each month. During the term of the “Group 29”
contract Transdev has committed to obtaining an Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) shop
certification. The Transdev division has five mechanics that are ASE certified and one mechanic that
is Master Technician certified.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the Transdev division consistently
meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with surrounding governments and communities. The team has
long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 25” contract to the new “Group 29” contract.

local operation is supported by a number of experienced professionals at the Regional level.
SBE goal set at 5%. Transdev’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by Transdev.

Packet Pg. 56

12.B

First Transit - The following is a summary of the First Transit “Group 29” proposal that does not
support the recommendation of contract award to First Transit:
Facility. First Transit proposed a bus facility at 18000 E. 22nd Avenue Aurora, CO 80011 with
arterial access to I-70 and I-225. The technical evaluation team determined this facility did not meet
the needs of the “Group 29” solicitation for two reasons.
1. Arterial access in this area is highly congested and would cause significant delays for buses
traveling to assigned bus routes. This would result in delayed service start times.
2. The proposed facility is located on the east side of metro Denver while the service package for
“Group 29” is located primarily on the west side of metro Denver. Buses would have to travel
greater distances to get to bus terminals resulting in increased diesel fuel use and cost to RTD.
Management Team. The proposed First Transit local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 29” RFP.
Cost. First Transit’s proposed price included an additional $10,600,000 in startup and additional
costs to support a new operating facility. The price proposal also included an additional $4,200,000
in additional management fees. For this reason and the others noted above, the technical evaluation
team determined that it was not in the best interest of the RTD to pursue any further action with the
First Transit “Group 29” proposal.
TRANSDEV “GROUP 25” PERFORMANCE:
The Transdev division currently operates the “Group 25” fixed route service package. The division’s
performance was evaluated based on the following Board of Directors adopted performance
measures:







Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles ≤2.0

Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: Transdev utilizes bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasize safety with

Packet Pg. 57

12.B

all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: Transdev raises awareness of passenger safety
through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000
miles. All five passenger accidents that occurred in 2019 were classified as non-preventable.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: Transdev places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: Transdev understands the impact new operators, construction detours, and
traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 25” contract, Transdev worked in
conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They identified low
performing routes and assigning street supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with
operators to discuss factors that impact their ability to run on time. Schedule issues are forwarded
to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: Transdev did not meet the goal in 2018 but improved to
46,843 Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls through May 2019 compared to 22,737
in 2018. During a 2018 routine review of maintenance activities, deficiencies were identified in
Transdev’s Maintenance Management team, Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality
Control (QC) practices. During the remainder of 2018, Transdev hired a new Maintenance Manager
and Quality Control Manager who in conjunction with the local and regional Transdev Management
teams, revised PMI and QC maintenance procedures. Transdev has since improved Preventive
Maintenance adherence to 100%, reduced repeat maintenance occurrences by 50% and improved
miles between lost service road calls to 46,843.
Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor Transdev to ensure they complete preventive
maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues,
provide additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses
in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: Transdev continues to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to reduce the number of customer
complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 29” service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent increase in bus operator wages by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
also similarly address labor challenges by increasing other wages. RTD also factored an increase in
costs for inflation. RTD Competitive Services total five-year estimate for the “Group 29” service
package was $144,179,082.
Transdev’s proposed total five-year price was $147,629,420. Transdev’s price proposal included
increases in inflation, CBA agreed upon Operator and Mechanic wage increases to address
differences between RTD and Transdev wages, and maintenance costs associated with the aging

First Transit’s proposed five year price was $166,732,373. First Transit’s price proposal included
significantly higher costs associated with starting up a new operating facility. First Transit’s price
proposal was not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD
would expect to pay for the “Group 29” service package. Below is a breakdown of the RTD

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the “Group 29” service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $165,571,112, which is $17,941,693 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by Transdev. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected wage
rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixed-route
services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the “Group
29” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and maintenance base
for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD operation. RTD
currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without building or leasing
additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the provision of the services.
The Transdev total five-year proposed price represents a $17,941,693 (11%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 29” - Proposer Service Cost

Funds for the provision of the 2020 portion of the first year of service under this contract will be
included in the 2020 RTD budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of
service in future years.
RTD will require the Contractor to contract with RTD’s fuel supplier in order to purchase diesel fuel at
the locked-in fuel price each year.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with
Transdev for the provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 29.”
This
contract is for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year
contract amount for service is $85,326,407.00; the option year 1 amount is
$30,560,167.00; and the option year 2 amount is $31,742,845.00. The total 5-year not-toexceed amount for service is $147,629,420.00. In addition, RTD will reimburse the
contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $9,614,906.00 for the initial 3year contract term; $3,356,141.00 for option year 1; and $3,435,828.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is $16,406,875.00. The total 5-year not-toexceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit service and fuel is $164,036,295.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
2)

Resolicit the “Group 29” service package. This is not recommended as the proposal process
has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive than it would cost

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

July 2, 2019

Subject:

Approval of 1st Amendment to the Salaried
Defined Contribution Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: July 2, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the First Amendment to the RTD Salaried Employee’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan effective
January 1, 2014.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The RTD Salaried Employee’s DC plan currently has the following provisions. If an employee
(Participant) is not yet vested and leaves RTD service, then they have five (5) years to return before they
are considered to have a permanent break in service. In addition, during that five (5) year period of time,
the Trust holds those funds in a suspense account in the event that the Participant returns within that
five (5) year period of time. The Trust cannot access those funds during that period of time. The
modifications outlined below would change the definition of “Permanent Break in Service” for those
employed on or after August 1, 2019 to one year, allowing the Trust to access the Participant’s account
balance within one year of termination of employment. Further, the modifications allow the Trust to
access the suspense account of those that began participating in the Plan and Trust prior to August 1,
2019 and terminate their employment with RTD before becoming 100% vested in their account balance.
In addition, if a Participant begins their participation on or after August 1, 2019, and has incurred a
Permanent Break in Service is re-employed by the employer, the Participant shall not be credited with
any Year of Service with respect to his or her prior service.
DISCUSSION
This amendment does several things:
 It modifies that definition of “Permanent Break in Service” from five (5) consecutive One-Year
Breaks in Service to a One-Year break in service for those Participants beginning their
participation in the plan on or after August 1, 2019.
 If the Participant has a “Permanent Break in Service” as defined above, the balance of the
Participant’s account will be forfeited.
 If the Participant returns to RTD after a “Permanent Break in Service” as defined above, the
Participant will not be credited any years of service with respect to his/her previous service.
 Allows the Trust to access the suspense account of those that began participating in the Plan and
Trust prior to August 1, 2019 and terminate their employment with RTD before or after August
1, 2019, before becoming 100% vested in their account balance.
o If the Participant returns before the five (5) years from their termination as an employee,
RTD will restore their suspense account.

Packet Pg. 64

13.C



Eliminate obsolete language regarding previous General Managers.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This would have a positive financial impact on RTD and the Trust as it would allow access to funds that
were previously tied up for long periods of time. As of 12/31/18, the Trust is currently holding
$897,197 in a suspense account for Participants that have left RTD prior to the five (5) year vesting
period and have not yet returned to RTD. Forfeited funds may be used to offset RTD contributions to
the 401(a) which frees up funds for other purposes.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Recommended Action: It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopt the First Amendment to the RTD Salaried Employee’s Defined
Contribution Plan effective January 1, 2014.
2. Don’t pass the amendment. The current process would remain the same.
