III.

Other Matters
General Manager Washington provided an update on several items:
 RTD had good participation in the APTA Rail conference and rodeo. There were
five Board members attending the conference. RTD received a number of requests
to present on Eagle and DUS. Marla Lien, General Counsel, participated in a preconference international Financial Practicum and shared a lot of good information
about our experience with DUS and Eagle as well. RTD earned 3 rd place overall at
the APTA International Rail Rodeo. RTD was also a recipient of a Certificate of
Merit for light rail safety and security. Director Hoy, General Manager Washington,
AGM-Rail Jenkins and AGM-Safety Genova accepted this award.
 General Manager Washington noted that a notification had been sent out
announced that the grand opening of DUS was being delayed. The message was
somewhat misleading in that it could be interpreted that RTD was delayed in their
opening. He has asked his PI to work with the PI for the opening of the Historical
Crawford hotel at DUS to make sure this announcement is clear. As we
understand the delay, the Crawford Hotel is ready and available for business but
the businesses that will occupy the space are not quite ready. Plans are to have
the Gala event as planned and the VIP reception on the 12th as noted. The official
opening to the public will be delayed. Chair Sisk shared that a question from the
CAC meeting was if the pedestrian bridge will be ready. His understanding is, not
until later but he asked GM Washington to confirm. Director James indicated his
understanding is it is the tenant finish that is delayed but that the hotel is ready to
go.
 General Manager Washington made a segue into the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI)
that is scheduled in Denver June 23-25. The Gala was planned for the DUS Grand
hall so he is not sure how this will be impacted. Relative to the CGI event itself, it
is his understanding that registration is by invitation only. They have been asked to
participate in the WIN and the Infrastructure of City and State component. They are
expecting approximately 800 people so he is not sure how Board members can
participate unless they have been invited.
 They have begun their summer intern and annual interns. This program has grown
to approximately 20 interns.
 Southeast extension (SE) — Staff plans to move this forward to put in the DRCOG
2014 plan. This is needed before RTD can apply for funds. The approval of the
DRCOG 2014 plan which includes SE says we support the move up of the SE
extension. This is a political decision but is very important to this organization. To
not approve this could be to forego approximately $92M in federal funds, and
$40M in stakeholders’ local contribution if you consider what they are offering in
cash and Right of Way (ROW). The Board needs to understand the significance of
this action and what we will be foregoing if not approved. This could also affect
the agency’s credibility. Foregoing the federal dollars with one of the largest local

stakeholder’s contribution is huge. What the SE community is offering is roughly
16-17% match compared to the average 2.5% match, making this one of the
largest ever local match. General Manager Washington has received the letter of
commitment from the stakeholders and staff will bring it to the Board for
consideration on July 8.
Director Tobiassen indicated he is in full support of the Southeast extension project.
However, he will be out of the country and cannot vote.
Director Folska expressed her full support as well. She asked if this requires a
super-majority vote. General Manager Washington responded that he believes so
but will confirm.
Chair Sisk responded that he had this conversation with General Counsel Marla
Lien. Marla had indicated that since this is for planning purposes, it may not
require a super-majority. However, this could be challenged by the general public
or other Board members. In a precedent case, this issue was challenged and was
ruled in favor of a super-majority. Her recommendation would be to avoid this
potential issue, it would be better to have a super-majority vote.
Director James expressed that all we are doing is collaborating with DRCOG to
have Southeast in the plan and it does not give any more priority to this corridor
than the Central or any other. General Manager Washington responded it does
move Southeast up and gives it more priority. However, we need to do this to get
into the engineering phase of the program. In order to meet these dates, RTD must
have this in the 2014 DRCOG plan which is due in September.
Director Folska inquired what is the impact of the Federal Highway Trust Fund
going bankrupt on new starts. General Manager Washington indicated we are
already in the pipeline and the Federal Trust Fund deals with base systems. It
would have no impact on capital programs.
Chair Sisk acknowledged this is a political tug of war. However, this is a major
opportunity for RTD to move FasTracks forward. He anticipates some pushback
from the unfunded corridors but it does not make sense to forego $92M. We have
an objective to get to 10 votes on this issue to avoid any challenge later.


Paula Perdue, Executive Director for the Board Office, announced that in 2015,
RTD will be hosting the APTA Board Members and Board Support Conference in
Denver. They have begun galvanizing the team and have come up with a theme for
next year called “Elevate Denver 2015.” The ideas behind this theme has to do
with the things Denver is known for (i.e. mountains, outdoors, rafting, heights, etc.
combined with RTD’s position as on the leading edge with innovativeness, high
energy, moving forward, etc.). We will be introducing this theme, logo and doing a
promotional for Denver at the 2014 conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Director Walker
will be attending along with staff support Barbara McManus and Erin Klaas.

Paula asked for any comments about the theme and logo from the committee
especially Chair Sisk and General Manager Washington. Some discussion occurred
around the color and the need to be bold. Paula indicated she would communicate
the comments to the marketing department but would like to defer to them for their
expertise on marketing and design.
Chair Sisk asked when Denver would be hosting the APTA annual. General
Manager Washington indicated the 2016 will be hosted by Los Angeles and Denver
is not equipped to handle the Expo. Most likely our next opportunity will be in
2018.
