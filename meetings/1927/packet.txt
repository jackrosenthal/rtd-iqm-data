Base System, $2.6 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $1.3 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, and Free MetroRide). Of the total increase, $1.0 million is attributed

 Net increase of $0.956 million for DUS operating costs allocated to FasTracks Operations
Debt Service
Interest expense is projected to remain stable on a combined basis with no change. Capitalized interest
as well is expected to show no change. COPs debt issued in 2014 for Base and FasTracks is projected
to begin amortizing in 2015. Principal payments on base system debt are projected to increase
minimally by $0.729 million due to updated debt amortization schedules.
2014 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $3.8 million over the
2014 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2014
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of an increase in Base of $32.3 million. Additions to new capital funding
include $32.7 million for restoration of funding for the articulated and transit buses that were subject of
a budget transfer to advance fund the intercity buses for BRT originally scheduled for purchase in 2016.
Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of a decrease of $28.6 million. This results from updated
project schedules for the North Metro and I-225 projects that changed the projected expenditures in
2014, adjustments for grant funding, and changes in cost estimates. Additions to new capital funding
include $18.1 million for additional commuter rail vehicles for the Eagle project approved by the Board in
December 2013, $4.7 million for light rail vehicle storage tracks for I-225 approved by the Board in April
2014, and $1.0 million for Peoria Interface coordination approved by the Board as part of the Annual
Program Evaluation in May 2014. Please see Attachment B for detail.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2014 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/13 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2014 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/13
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2013.
Previously approved capital carryforward is decreased by $136.9 million from the 2014 Adopted Budget
to reflect fourth quarter 2013 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects as
expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The Base System portion is a decrease of $8.4 million and the FasTracks decrease is $128.6 million.
Please see Attachment C for detail.

Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $20.5 million on a combined basis from the
2014 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $0.360 million based on the CU-Leeds
School March forecast of 7.4% vs. 7.5% in the Adopted Budget.
Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to decrease $20.7 million over amounts
projected in the 2014 Adopted Budget. This reflects decreasing allocations on the Base System
in fixed guideway, CMAQ-STAMPS, FASTER grants and Bus Facilities funding from the 2014
Adopted Budget, offset by increases in FTA State of Good Repair funding. FasTracks allocated
grants are expected to remain stable.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals run rate.
Other income is projected to remain stable at $20.7 million.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $14.1 million from the Adopted Budget to
$9.4 million reflecting amended budget increases, year-end accruals and the net pension obligation.

FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2014 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues

Packet Pg. 15

2.11.A

divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2014 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund on the Base System are reduced from $5.0 million to each fund to $3.0 million to
each fund in 2014.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2014 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2014 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2014 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2014 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

June 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: June 19, 2014

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 4060’ Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in
an amount not to exceed $26,720,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 40 additional
60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 14 years old and have accumulated on average 406,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have become
unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. Many of the parts required for the
repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the
replacement of the 9100 Series buses over three years, 40 buses in 2013, 40 buses in 2014 and 18
buses in 2015.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement was
the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17, 2013.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the
purchase option for a guaranteed quantity of 40 additional articulated buses.
DISCUSSION
The 60’ articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger

Packet Pg. 43

2.12.B

count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 55
passenger seats and two spaces for storage of large items such as child stroller and shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the purchase option for
a guaranteed quantity of 40 articulated buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $26,720,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2014
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to New Flyer for the purchase of
forty (40) additional articulated buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 11040' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053
with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $46,428,700 for the purchase of 110 additional 40’ transit
buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 14 years old and have accumulated on average 610,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus
manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts required
for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for
the replacement of the Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014
and 64 buses in 2015.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an
inflationary price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or
PPI which is published monthly.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a guaranteed quantity of 110 additional 40’ transit buses.
DISCUSSION
The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger

2.12.C

count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as child stroller and shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
guaranteed quantity of 110-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $46,428,700. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2014
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the

Board Meeting Date: June 19, 2014

Subject:

Approval of NAMS Recommendation

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution, which accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the
Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.
Implementation of these priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.
BACKGROUND
In April 2013, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. RTD engaged HNTB Corp. to serve as
the lead consultant in March 2013.
The study had five key tasks as described below:
1. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor
and determine what, if any, BRT elements are needed to achieve full BRT in the corridor;
2. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail in
segments;
3. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Corridor from SH 7 to Longmont;
4. Evaluate potential for early implementation mobility improvements in the area, such as arterial
BRT; and
5. Conduct a high-level analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown Express
lanes.
The study was governed by:
1. A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), made up of staff members from the northwest area
local jurisdictions, CDOT, DRCOG, the University of Colorado Boulder, 36 Commuting
Solutions and the North Area Transportation Alliance (NATA); and
2. A Policy Advisory Committee, made up of the elected officials from the local jurisdictions, as
well as a representative from CDOT, the 36 Commuting Solutions Board of Directors, NATA
and the RTD Board members representing Districts within the study area (Directors Anderson,
Hoy, Lubow and Sisk).
RTD staff, the consultant and the stakeholders contributed significant input throughout the study.
At the final PAC meeting held on April 18, 2014, the stakeholders came to a consensus on how to

Packet Pg. 47

2.13.D

move forward with transit improvements in the northwest area. A Consensus Statement was
developed to document the principles and priorities that the stakeholders desired.
DISCUSSION
The Consensus Statement includes a section that discusses general principles and a section which
discusses prioritization of potential projects.
General Principles
The Consensus Statement general principles are as follows:
• An overarching theme serves as a basis from which consensus on the priorities is grounded:
The Northwest area remains committed to Northwest Rail, as envisioned in FasTracks. Given
the projected timing of Northwest Rail’s implementation, the Northwest stakeholders want to
see mobility benefits sooner.
• Projects on this prioritized list should not be considered absolutely sequential. Nothing should
preclude the pursuit or acceleration of any of these priorities should viable opportunities or
partners become available. More than one priority can be pursued simultaneously. RTD
should be proactive, aggressive and creative in monitoring these projects for any significant
developments that help a project move forward, such as public or P3 funding opportunities.
Priorities
The Consensus Statement’s priorities are as follows:
1. Completion of the Remaining US 36 BRT Commitments – These are the commitments that
were included in the Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit, as approved by the
RTD Board of Directors September 17, 2013.
2. Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service – Proceed into advanced planning, environmental
clearance and preliminary engineering via submittal of TIGER Planning Grant (submitted April
28, 2014) for SH 119 from Longmont to Boulder as the first priority; and US 287 (as selected
by staff, based on cost effectiveness and ridership) as the next priority. One or both corridors
could be implemented following the next phase of study based on further refinement of
regional priorities, project scopes, funding availability and leveraging opportunities.
3. North I-25/Downtown Express Reverse Commute Solutions – In the short-term, RTD should
work with CDOT to advance a bus-on-shoulder concept. For the long-term, advanced
planning for systematic improvements should be initiated for this segment of I-25.
4. Northwest Rail – The stakeholders recognize the present funding challenges and
accompanying near-term inability to secure an agreement with the BNSF. However, as noted
above, completion of Northwest Rail, while a longer term goal, remains a priority. On an
annual basis, RTD will explore and update Northwest Rail implementation strategies and
report to stakeholders and the public.
5. Remaining Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service Corridors – This priority would be a long-term
goal depending on funding availability and further refinement of regional goals, project scopes,
funding availability and leveraging opportunities. These corridors include:
a. SH 7 from Boulder to I-25
b. 120th Avenue from Broomfield to I-25
c. S. Boulder Rd from Boulder to I-25
d. SH 42/95th Street in the Louisville area
e. 28th Street/Broadway Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service improvements.

Packet Pg. 48

2.13.D

North Metro Extension from SH 7 to Longmont
Given the high estimated cost, combined with projected low ridership, the stakeholders opted not to
proceed with any action that would advance the North Metro Rail Extension (from SH 7 to
Longmont) at this time. They recommended that the corridor should be re-evaluated in the future if
population densities or other conditions change.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact directly related to this action; however, should the Board at a later date, and
after further study, opt to move forward with specific recommendations from the Consensus, there will
be a financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached resolution, which accepts
the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study
stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.
Implementation of these
priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study
stakeholders. This action is not recommended given the considerable commitment on the part
of RTD and the stakeholders to reach this consensus, which provides RTD a path forward for
implementing mobility improvements in the Northwest area.

efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area;
Whereas, the Northwest area stakeholders and RTD executed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) dated January 14, 2013. The MOU included a stakeholder involvement plan for achieving
consensus;
Whereas, RTD and the stakeholders analyzed a wide variety of alternatives to address the study
purpose; and
Whereas, the Northwest area stakeholders formulated the attached Final Consensus Statement,
which was endorsed on April 18, 2014, to document the principles and priorities which the stakeholders
desired for mobility improvements in the Northwest area; and
Whereas, RTD has submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) grant to pursue advanced planning on two of the high-priority Bus Rapid Transit corridors
identified in the Final Consensus Statement.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors accepts the attached Final Consensus Statement as developed by
the Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders and presented to the Board Planning & Development
Committee on May 13, 2014; and
