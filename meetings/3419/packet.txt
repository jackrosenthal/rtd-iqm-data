BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Fourth Amendment to CEO and GM Employment
Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
October 13, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
October 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Fourth Amendment to the CEO and GM Employment Agreement to
adjust the appraisal criteria for the January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 performance period for
General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson as set forth in the proposed amendment.
Added to Committee Agenda by the Performance Committee Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws
Article VI., Section 1(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
REPRESENTATIVE
Director Shontel Lewis, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement, dated September 29, 2020, which
provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by which the Board will
annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. The deadline for the Board to adopt the performance
evaluation program was originally March 9, 2021. Consistent with the anticipated RTD Strategic Plan
development timeline, in February 23, 2021, the Board approved a First Amendment to the Agreement,
extending the deadline to no later than June 30, 2021. On June 29, 2021, the Board approved a
Second Amendment further extending the deadline to July 30, 2021. On July 20, 2021, the Board
approved a Third Amendment establishing the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation
program for Ms. Johnson incorporating the Board-adopted Strategic Plan values, strategic priorities,
success outcomes, and metrics.
Surveys were conducted to establish a baseline to measure the strategic priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership. On February 17, 2022, the Performance Committee
received a presentation on the results of the Customer Excellence survey (conducted in October 2021)
and the Community Value survey (conducted in November 2021). On September 14, 2022, the
Performance Committee received a presentation on the results of the Employee Ownership survey
(conducted in May 2022, which was held at that time to coincide with represented employees’ bidding
on their shifts prior to the service change implemented later that month).
The follow up Community and Customer surveys were conducted by BBC Research in September. The
follow up Employee survey will not be conducted until spring 2023.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

It is recommended that the Board adopt a fourth amendment to the Employment Agreement to adjust
the appraisal criteria for the January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 performance period to
account for the timing of the anticipated follow up Employee Ownership survey given that only a
baseline was established in 2022. The proposed amendment eliminates the Success Outcome of
Employee Ownership and provides that Ms. Johnson will only be evaluated upon Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success, with equal weight being given to each for a total of 50%
of the appraisal score for this performance period. The other 50% of the appraisal score will remain
based upon an evaluation of the organizational values (Passion, Respect, Diversity, Trustworthiness,
Collaboration, and Ownership).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact for this recommended action is reflected in the attached agreement and proposed
amendment.
