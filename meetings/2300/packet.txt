BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: June 4, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

June 4, 2015

Board Meeting Date: June 16, 2015

Subject:

August 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost of approximately $279,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two proposals implementing service at new facilities slated to be open in time for the August service
change. Boulder Junction at Depot Square (33rd – Pearl Street) is scheduled to be opened with
accompanied changes to existing route services: HX and S and Central Park Station Bus Plaza and parkn-Ride will replace the existing Stapleton park-n-Ride with accompanied changes to existing route
services: 28, 38, 40, 43, 65, 73, 88, 89, 105, AB and AS. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Seven public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between May 27th
and June 3rd. Public meetings were held in Aurora, Denver, Boulder, Lakewood and Highlands Ranch.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this
report.

(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $279,000 annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2015 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
LOOK AHEAD – January 17, 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 US36 BRT Service Plan restructures the majority of Regional Service aligned along US 36
into the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit service.




Route 79L/83L rescheduling and rebranding to simplify customer information in the
Speer/Leetsdale corridor.
Route 6 restructure creating a distinct east-west service (Route 6) and a north-south
service to be named the Route 19 – North Pecos.
Grant funded peak period service increase on the Free MetroRide

1.B.1.a

Route 1 – West 1st Avenue
An all-day vehicle is proposed to be added to Route 1, due to the proposal on the Route
26, which results in a break of the interline between Route 1 and 26. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $165,300 annualized.
Route 1W – West 1st Avenue
In conjunction with the discontinuance of the Route 9 school tripper, it is proposed to
reroute Route 1W to operate on Knox Ct between 6th Ave and 10th Ave, 10th Ave between
Knox Ct and Decatur St, and Decatur St between 8th Ave and 10th Ave. The remaining
route will be unchanged. Route 1W will be scheduled to arrive at West High School at
7:20am and depart at 3:40pm. Anticipated cost estimated to be $2,600 annualized.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/ North Pecos
It is proposed to realign Route 6 to stay on Navajo St between 32nd Ave and 34th Ave.
Drainage has been improved in this area and the street is no longer a hazard in freezing
temperatures. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway / Huron
It is proposed to return the southbound terminal of Route 8 to 13th/Welton during weekday
evenings and on weekends. It is also proposed to discontinue Route 8 service to Denver
Water, with all trips terminating at 13th/Welton. Service to Denver Water is proposed to be
provided by an improved Route 34 (proposed Route 33). Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $31,000 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue the Route 9 school tripper starting at
Lakewood-Wadsworth Station at 6:22am. The Route 9 will also be extended from Larimer20th Street to 31st –Brighton Boulevard to address overloads currently being experienced
on the Route 48 – East 48th Ave/Commerce City.
Cost savings are estimated to be
$13,000 annualized.

Route 0 – South Broadway
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve connections with Routes 15 and 16
during late night periods in the Downtown area. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route 9 - West 10th Avenue
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue
Route 28 – 28th Avenue
Route 76 _ Wadsworth Crosstown
This proposal recombines Routes 26 and 28 at Wadsworth Boulevard. A new routing to
turnaround the Route 9 is proposed using 14th Avenue to Pierce Street to 10th Avenue.
Additional Sunday service is proposed to be added to Route 76 to maintain an appropriate
service frequency along Wadsworth Boulevard in Lakewood.
Anticipated net cost savings is estimated to be $195,000 annualized
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 12 – Downing/North Washington
Discontinue 6:07pm southbound trip from Corona/Colfax to Englewood Station. Trip
averages between 8-14 boardings per hour. This proposal reduces frequency south of
Colfax from every 15 to every 30 minutes between 6:00pm and 6:30pm. A reroute
northbound buses to remain on Downing Street at the 30th & Downing LRT Station is also
proposed. The northbound stop at 29th Avenue is very convenient to the station platform.
This proposal reduces travel time by approximately 3 minutes and eliminates a very
difficult left turn from California Street onto Downing. Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $8,200 annualized.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Discontinue Route 15 deviation into the Anschutz Medical Campus on Saturday and
Sunday. Route averages only one boarding or alighting for every 3 bus trips on weekends.
Route 20 will continue to provide direct campus service.
Discontinue Route 15 deviation south of Colfax via Sable, 13th Avenue, and
Chambers Road. Area is well served by Route 15L on Sable and Route 153 on Chambers
Road. Also discontinue loop via Chambers, 17th Avenue, and Jasper Street.
Extend Route 15 directly east on Colfax Avenue, continuing east to Himalaya
Street, replacing Route 15L Tower Road branch. Route 15 service to Tower Road will
include Saturday/Sunday/holidays, as elimination of deviations should allow this extension
at no additional operating cost. (Note: Saturday service will be every 15 minutes as far
east as Billings Street, then every 30 minutes to Tower Road. Sunday/holiday service will
be every 30 minutes).
Route 15L Tower Road branch trips will be cut back to terminate/originate at
Colfax/Billings (East Metro Garage). Service east of Sable Blvd. is replaced by extended
Route 15. Current Route 15L service to Centrepoint & Sable will remain unchanged.

anticipated to be an estimated $2,580 annualized.
Route 30L – Federal Boulevard Limited
This proposal re-aligns the service in the downtown area to be routed along Stout Street in
the place of Welton Street, but utilizes the same terminal at 22nd Champa. This new
alignment should provide more consistent operation of this service, thereby improving ontime performance. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed during the early morning and late night periods
to better coordinate connections with Route 16. It is proposed to move the afternoon
northbound school tripper to start at Federal/Evans at 3:21pm from 3:17pm.
It is proposed to shift the times of the afternoon southbound school trippers to leave
Federal/32nd at 2:55pm and 4:05pm in order to better match school dismissals. No

vehicle as a Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The
Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 11:00pm.
On Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. The Saturday Call-nRide has not met the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The hours
between 7:00pm and 11:00pm carry less than one customer per hour. This
recommendation is to end the service day at 7:00pm. Anticipated savings are estimated to
be $11,152 in annual costs, which include fuel.

Route HX – 28th Street/Civic Center
With the opening of Boulder Junction at Depot Square Transit Center, it is proposed to
extend route HX into the new facility, from its current terminal at Pearl Street/29th Street.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006. The Call-n-Ride has
had difficulty in meeting the RTD standard of 3 boardings per hour. Douglas County, the
Highlands Ranch Metro District and the RTD agreed upon a cost share agreement for 2015
to keep the service. Additionally, a Transportation Advisory Committee was formed to
look at ideas to make the Call-n-Ride more productive. The Committee came up with
numerous ideas that will be implemented over the next few months. This recommendation
identifies the reduction of area served by the Call-n-Ride. The recommended area for
discontinuance is south of C-470, north of University and east of Colorado Blvd. The
current riders will be grandfathered into the service. No new riders will be accepted.
No cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012. The Call-n-Ride was
funded under a Job Access Reverse Commute grant. The Call-n-Ride operates MondayFriday 5:30am – 10:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 10:00pm. The weekday Call-n-Ride
operates with four peak vehicles. One vehicle operates a flex route to Lockheed Martin
operating two trips in the am and two in the pm. This flex route has not met the RTD
Service Standard of three boardings per hour. This recommendation is to discontinue the
Lockheed Martin Flex route and move the resources to the weekday Call-n-Ride service. In
turn, the Call-n-Ride will be allowed to serve Lockheed Martin by a Call-n-Ride trip that is
scheduled by the Lockheed Martin employees as a group. The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
will have some modifications with schedule times at the station in order to make the Calln-Ride more reliable. With these additional resources, changes will be made to the
weekday service delivery model in order to make the weekday Call-n-Ride a more reliable
service to the customer. The Way To Go program will look at providing a vanpool as an
alternative for the Lockheed Martin customers. No anticipated cost impact.
Light Rail: E Line – Lincoln/Union Station
It is proposed to add one train in each direction in the AM and PM peak periods (7:24 AM
northbound from Lincoln Station, 7:14 AM southbound from Union Station, 5:09 PM northbound
from Lincoln Station, and 4:28 PM southbound from Union Station). This continues to assist
with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W Line transfers as well as increased
school ridership in the fall. This proposal also advances the eventual goal of 15-minute E Line
frequencies in the entire AM and PM peak periods. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be
$189,000 annualized.
Light Rail: E Line and F Line
It is proposed to adjust late morning pull-ins and early afternoon pullouts to provide more efficient
service between Lincoln Station and downtown. This proposal has marginal impacts to
passengers; service levels would remain the same. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.

Light Rail: H Line – Nine Mile/Downtown
It is proposed to discontinue the 2:18 AM southbound trip from downtown on late Friday and
Saturday nights. This trip was added in August 2014 as a “clean up” trip through downtown
after the other late night trains, but has resulted in comparatively lower ridership than its D Line
and E Line counterpart trips. Approximately 34 boardings would be affected that would need to
take a train approximately 10 minutes earlier. The northbound trip from 1:36 AM between Nine
Mile and I-25 & Broadway Station would be retained. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$30,500 annualized.
School Service
Implement seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F.
(Route 43 school trippers replaced by improved regular Route 43 frequency)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE
Resume fall/winter schedule

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETING
EastRidge Recreation Center
Wednesday, May 27, 2015
6:00 P.M.
Brian Matthews and Doug Monroe were in attendance. One person showed up. Alice is a member of
the HR Transportation Advisory Committee and wanted to show up for the support of changes. We
waited until 6:15pm and closed down the meeting.
It should be noted that this meeting was added to the proposed meetings after the brochure was
printed to discuss proposed boundary changes to the Call-n-Ride. A flyer was handed out on the Call-nRide and every customer that attended the previous Call-n-Ride public meeting and provided contact
information was notified via phone or e-mail about the proposed changes.

This meeting was conducted by Jessie Carter and Patrick Heye. No members of the RTD
Board of Directors were in attendance, nor were any other elected officials. Four (4)
members of the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at
6:05 P.M.
The purpose and format for the meeting was explained. Given the small audience, it was
determined to proceed directly to public testimony.
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:
 Commenter representing Lockheed Martin employees requested that the RTD
reconsider the cancellation of Southwest Jeffco Call-n-Ride service to the Lockheed
site. She stated that 300 more employees have been added to the location and that
additional marketing could be done to attract more riders. She was joined by two
others who participated in the meeting who also shared that an internship program
was starting near term, with students who would be dependent on the Call-n-Ride
service to the Lockheed site.
 Commenter representing employees of Denver Water expressed concern over the
proposed changes to Routes 8 and 33/34. She wanted to know how the schedules
would be coordinated with other bus services and light rail.
Without further comments, the meeting was concluded at 6:25pm.

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Additional staff in attendance included Steve
Hopkins and Diane Marquiss. Director Walker was also in attendance. One (1) member of
the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at 6:01 P.M.
Mr. Monroe thanked the attendee for her attendance. He introduced himself, staff
members, and Director Walker. Given the small audience, it was determined to proceed
directly to public testimony.
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:
 Commenter is a long-time transit rider and expressed dissatisfaction with the
discontinuance of Route 8 service to Denver Water during peak hours. Replacement
service for the route, Route 33, will not connect with her origination route
downtown (Route 10), requiring the use of a third route to connect. She
recommended Route 8 continue to serve Denver Water, perhaps with reduced

frequency. The commenter believed the proposed removal of parking at the Denver
Water campus would increase ridership on the route. (Staff shared the challenges
surrounding the Platte Valley industrial area, including Denver Water’s planned
removal of the Route 8 turnaround/layover location due to the imminent
reconstruction of its campus. Staff also explained it had met with Denver Water
representatives multiple times to discuss the proposed service adjustments –
including the same day as this meeting – and received support from the agency
regarding the proposal.)
Seeing no further comments, Mr. Monroe thanked the attendee for her time and invited
her to contact RTD if she had any further questions. Adjournment occurred at 6:11 P.M.,
with staff remaining until 6:25 P.M. to serve potential late-arriving commenters.

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Additional staff in attendance included Steve
Hopkins and Diane Marquiss. Director Menten was also in attendance. Four (4) members
of the public signed the attendance sheet. The meeting was called to order at 6:02 P.M.
The format of the meeting was conversational in nature. Mr. Monroe thanked the audience
for its attendance and described the purpose of the evening’s meeting. He introduced
himself, staff members, and Director Menten.
Mr. Monroe asked if any attendees had any questions prior to providing public testimony.
One attendee questioned the rationale for the proposed changes to Routes 26 and 28.
Staff explained that the loss of a layover location on Wadsworth Boulevard and low
ridership on the Wadsworth segment of the routes led to the proposal. It was also
explained that daily service to Applewood would be maintained by Route 28 at similar
times to Route 26.
Seeing no further questions, the following public testimony was received:
Regarding proposed service changes for August 2015:


Commenter uses Route 26 to connect between 27th/Youngfield and
Lakewood/Wadsworth Station. She is “fed up” with RTD, stating that taxpayers are
not receiving the benefits from the taxes collected. The elimination of Route 100
service on Sundays adds to the challenge of using the bus in that area. She stated

Packet Pg. 19

Attachment: Attach B Public Meeting Notes August 2015 Service Changes (2389 : Board Report August 2015 Service Changes)

1.B.1.b

that the waste in the RTD administration could be put to better use on the street.
She believes that the proposal would result in significant walking distance
increases, making the bus an unviable option.
(Staff interjected to ensure the commenter’s comprehension of the proposal. It was
identified that she was of the belief that all service along 26th and 27th Avenues
would be discontinued. Staff assured her that this was not part of the proposed
service changes.)
Commenter continued that she was more understanding of the changes thanks to
the clarification provided by staff. She added that the connection times between
Routes 28 and Routes 76 and 100 needed to be better coordinated and that light
rail connection times were not necessary to consider. She likes the way Route 26
currently runs, allowing her to travel to and make connections at Lakewood
Commons/Belmar. There is too much redundant service to downtown Denver and
not enough service to other destinations.
(Director Menten interjected to confirm that Route 76 service along Wadsworth
would be maintained, and Mr. Monroe added that Sunday frequency would be
increased to every 30 minutes.)


Commenter has been a transit rider since the 1960s and just learned of the
proposed service changes to Route 26. He believes that the W-Line is working and
provides a good connection to downtown Denver and Golden. Route 26 is
innovative and should be kept. He described discontinued Route 125, which
previously provided service between Youngfield and the Federal Center via Colorado
Mills. He also described the convenience Route 17 used to provide. The lack of
connections between 38th/Youngfield and West Colfax Avenue is hard to
understand. He believes Route 26 is fabulous and is upset that RTD is going to
cancel it regardless of public comment. He stated that Routes 32, 38, and 44 all
travel between Youngfield and downtown Denver and questioned why a fourth
route would need to traverse the same route. He encouraged other riders to submit
their comments to RTD in email form or to attend public hearings. He also
suggested that Route 26 could layover on the southbound sidewalk on Wadsworth
Boulevard underneath the light rail station. He encouraged RTD to better publicize
the route and ask light rail customers which bus route they might use to reach the
station if their personal vehicle became unavailable.



Commenter believes that RTD should be more aggressive in acquiring increased
funding for its services. She occasionally rides Route 26 and notes that the bus
does not have many riders. Her primary concern is for increased service on Route
76 to help minimize transfer times and reduce overcrowding. She believes that the
segments of Routes 76 and 100 between Colfax and Interstate 70 are in need of
increased service, perhaps through the reduction of service on the northern and
southern segments of these routes. She feels that by averaging ridership figures for
the entire route, RTD does not see the actual picture of what ridership looks like
along the route. It was added that coordinating meet times at light rail stations is
unnecessary, but that coordinating transfer times between buses which run less
frequently is much more important. She added that the current timing of Routes 26

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.1.b

and 28 mean that customers can’t transfer from one route to the other because
they run simultaneously. She mentioned that RTD has a tendency to overweigh the
authority of self-appointed neighborhood representatives who might not actually
represent the opinions of those in the neighborhood. She concluded her comments
reiterating her desire for increased service along Wadsworth on Sunday.
A general conversation followed regarding the costs of providing parking lots around the
district. Those in attendance who commented all deemed the cost to RTD as excessive
and that RTD should charge people who use these facilities. The location of certain parking
facilities was discussed, including that some neighborhoods who had spoken against
parking lots have received them anyway.
Seeing no further comments, Mr. Monroe thanked the attendees for their time and advised
them of the Board of Directors meeting on June 16, 2015. Adjournment occurred at 7:01
P.M., with staff remaining to answer further questions from the public.

Proposed August Service Changes - Route 120

Hello RTD staff,
I am writing on behalf of the City and County of Broomfield to support the proposed increase in service for the Route
120. The corridor between the Wagon Road Park n Ride and the Broomfield BRT Station has continued to develop and
serve additional riders. The 120th Avenue corridor also emerged from the North Area Mobility Study as a location that
has potential for arterial Bus Rapid Transit and we look forward to exploring that possibility with you some time in the
future.
We very much appreciate this service enhancement and will be happy work with RTD to promote it when it is
implemented.
Sincerely,
Debra A. Baskett

Dear Mr. Monroe,
You ask "Is there a particular building or complex at Evans/Depew in which elderly or disable passengers live? Or is it
just that general area? That information will certainly help us in making a decision."
It is the general area. For example, in my building the manager, Ray McKeachie, is a wheel chair bound Vet. Further
south is Nellie Pipzr at 2155 S. Depew. For Nellie to board the bus, the driver must lower the shoulder to assist
her. When I told Nellie Sunday morning as we were waiting for the 7:23am 21 East about the purposed changes, she
lamented "I'm so tired already when I come home, I don't want to walk another block to get home."
Neither she or the other gentleman waiting for the 21 had heard of the purposed changes, nor did either of them use
the internet. (I knew only because of an email.)
You also said "Route 21 currently averages about 2 passenger boardings per trip between Sheridan and Federal. We
expect that the bus running on Jewell will attract more riders and also improve service for passengers riding through
that section."
I would argue that while you may be attracting more riders from North of Jewell, but you will be doing a disservice to
the riders along Evans between Sheridan & Federal. I would also say that from my riding the 21 both east & west 5‐7
days a week, I see 4 or more riders picked up along Evans EVERY day of the week, depending on the time of day. If data
collecting by the drivers is practiced as often as the drivers on the 21 route announce connections, your rider data is
under reported 50% OF THE TIME.

I ask you please DO NOT GO FORWARD with this change to the 21 route. As this change will degrade
service for as many if not more riders then will be gained from the change.

Sincerely, Don Lewis

15/15L Suggestions

I have noted that you plan to change the route 15/15L bus route to exclude the Anschutz Medical Campus, and I
am protesting this modification.
The UCDenver Anschutz Medical Campus hosts some of the most cutting-edge medical research in the world
and is rapidly growing. Many employees and students rely on public transportation to access the campus. Thus,
removing the campus from the route would create an unnecessary burden on individuals wishing to come to the
Anschutz Medical Campus, and would likely result in decreased use of the bus route altogether.
Furthermore, it would require employees and students to walk further from a stop to reach the campus in a
neighborhood that is not altogether safe for walking extended distances, especially when employees and
students are walking by themselves. This is an issue of usage as well as safety. Please maintain the Anschutz
Medical Campus as part of the current route.

Proposed Service Change to Route 15

Regarding RTD's proposed service change to "discontinue the route 15 deviation via Aurora Court into the Anschutz
Medical Campus," I highly discourage such a decision. I have been a long‐time (well over 10 years) rider on Route
15/15L because I work at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Every trip, I see seniors and families ride
the 15 bus who get off at one of the stops along Aurora Court in order to keep their medical appointments at University
Hospital and clinics or Children's Hospital. Eliminating the Route 15 stops along Aurora Court makes a much longer walk
for seniors/families to see their doctors. When an individual doesn't feel well or has a mobility limitation, the extra walk
from East Colfax onto the Anschutz Medical Campus can be grueling and even dangerous to their health and safety,
particularly in inclement weather.
University of Colorado students and employees also ride the 15 bus and then walk to and from their respective buildings
on campus. Eliminating the Route 15 stops along Aurora Court means adding 10‐15 minutes walk time for students and
employees, often making it even more difficult to arrive at class or work on time or to catch connecting buses and light
rail at the end of the day.
While the 20 bus also stops along Aurora Court, it does not connect with West Colfax buses along the remainder of its
route and the 20 bus does not run as often as the 15 bus. One of the perks of the 15 bus over the 15L is that the 15 runs
often and stops every 2‐3 blocks, while the 15L runs just as often and makes far fewer stops. Both 15 and 15L are
crowded. My experience has been that real travel time on the 15 and 15L are very close to being the same, so why
eliminate the convenience of Route 15 bus stops along Aurora Court? Please reconsider the service change to Route 15
to keep the bus running along Aurora Court.
