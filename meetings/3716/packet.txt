appointment of Director Vince Buzek to the Committee.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE

BACKGROUND
The Committee is comprised of five members, including three RTD Directors and two external audit
experts/professionals. The current membership and terms of all Committee members are:

Two-year term, exp. 12/31/2024**
Three-year term, exp. 12/31/2025

In order to be eligible to serve on the Committee, Directors must have served on the Board of Directors
for at least one year.
*Following Director Dishell’s forthcoming resignation, his term on the Board of Directors will expire on
November 17, 2024. However, he has expressed an interest to remain on the Committee and is eligible,
per the Committee’s charter, to seek the Board’s approval to continue to serve on the Committee for a
period of up to one year. Should the Board approve Director Dishell’s request to remain on the
Committee, his term would expire on November 17, 2025.
**Mr. Olenberger’s current term is expiring on December 31, 2024. Because he has both indicated a
desire to remain on the Committee and served admirably, it will be recommended to the Executive
Committee to reappoint Mr. Olenberger for a term commencing January 1, 2025, and expiring December
31, 2026. This mirrors the process to reappoint Directors Catlin and Dishell to the Committee in 2023 to
terms expiring in 2025.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

As noted above, Director Davidson’s term as a member of the Committee is expiring on December 31,
2024. This will leave open one seat on the Committee to be filled by a Director.
At the request of Chair Davidson, on October 8, 2024, the Board Office solicited interest from Directors
to serve on the Committee. Directors were asked to submit to the Board Office a resume and letter of
interest by Friday, October 25, following which the Board Office would forward the aforementioned
documents to the Committee for review. Only Director Vince Buzek submitted documents to indicate his
interest in serving on the Committee.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is now asked to discuss, and to consider recommending to the Executive Committee,
Director Buzek’s appointment to the Committee.
Director Buzek has served on the Board since January 2019 and was instrumental in reshaping the
Committee in its current form. Originally elected in November 2018, Director Buzek was re-elected in
November 2022. Outside of RTD, Director Buzek has practiced law since 1987, primarily serving clients
in Illinois (1987-1994) and Colorado (1994 to present). Director Buzek previously served as a Council
Member for the City and County of Broomfield from 1999 to 2007. Additionally, Director Buzek has
served on the Adams County Planning Commission, Colorado Gaming Commission, and Broomfield
Economic Development Corporation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to this recommendation.

Audit Committee Charter

1.C.1.a

Subject: Audit Committee Charter
Page 2

The Audit Committee will consist of at least three and no more than five members, all of whom, in the judgment of
the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify as
independent, an audit committee member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the organization
beyond their duties as a committee member or Board Member. The members should collectively possess sufficient
knowledge of audit, finance, specific industry knowledge, IT, law, governance, risk, and control. Because the
responsibilities of the Audit Committee evolves in response to regulatory, economic, and reporting developments, it
is important to periodically re-evaluate members’ competencies and the overall balance of skills on the committee in
response to emerging needs. At least one member shall be designated as the "financial expert," as defined by
applicable legislation and regulation.
The Board of Directors shall have three members of the Audit Committee, each of whom shall have served on the
Board of Directors for at least one year. Should a Director cease to maintain a position on the Board of Directors,
such a Director can, with the approval of the Board of Directors, continue to serve on the Audit Committee for a
period of up to one year.
The members of the Audit Committee, by a majority vote, will designate a chair and vice chair, for a period of one
year
The term of office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term, staggered with at
least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of the Audit Committee will have
two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance of Audit Committee members will be
reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit Committee, the appointment of members should be
staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit Committee.
Each member of the Audit Committee shall serve for such term or terms as the Board may determine or until his or
her earlier resignation, removal or death. Any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board. No member of
the Audit Committee shall be removed as a member, except upon the affirmative vote of ten Directors.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee will meet at least four times a year, with authority to convene additional meetings, as
circumstances require. All committee members are expected to attend each meeting, in person or virtually, and are
obligated to prepare for and participate in meetings. The quorum for the Audit Committee will be a majority of its
members.
The Chief Audit Executive (as defined in the internal audit charter) and Chief Financial Officer are required to attend
all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate meetings as well
as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its auditors, to
be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be prepared and all
documentation related to the Audit Committee and its dealings may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act,
C.R.S. § 24-72-201 et seq., as amended. The Audit Committee will provide updates to the Board of Directors at least
quarterly.
The Audit Committee will invite members of management or others to attend meetings and provide pertinent
information, as necessary.
Audit Committee members will receive formal orientation training on the purpose and mandate of the committee and
on the organization’s objectives. A process of continuing education will be established.

It is recommended by RTD Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell that the Board of Directors appoint as
members of the Independent Audit Committee Jim Brendel (External Member) to a three-year term
expiring December 31, 2025, John Olenberger (External Member) to a two-year term expiring December

REPRESENTATIVE
Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function, both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown)for professional
assistance in implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute
of Internal Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD to enter a contract with RubinBrown to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the RTD Board Chair appointed Directors Catlin, Davidson and Dishell to an Audit Ad Hoc
Committee to coordinate with RubinBrown on recommendations to the Board to implement the
outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD Audit Committee.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM

In August 2022, the Audit Ad Hoc Committee, in coordination with RubinBrown, began the recruitment
for Audit Committee members. Recruitment for community members interested in volunteering to serve
on the committee was publicly advertised through the RTD website and LinkedIn. Applicants were asked
to respond to the request for qualifications with a letter of interest and resume.
Audit Committee members are expected to:
•
•
•

Possess the financial acumen to read and understand RTD’s financial statements and to
otherwise help the Board fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities
Attend four to five Audit Committee meetings per year
Review committee materials in advance of meetings and come prepared to ask questions and
participate in discussions

A total of six applications were received from external applicants and three applications were received
from current Board members.
Consistent with the Audit Committee Charter, adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022, the term of
office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term,
staggered with at least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of
the Audit Committee will have two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance
of Audit Committee members will be reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit
Committee, the appointment of future members should be staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit
Committee.

of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. The purpose of
this action is to appoint well-qualified individuals who can advise the District on a range of transit issues
that affect RTD customers, the public, and the region.
The Audit Ad Hoc Committee in conjunction with RubinBrown and Chief Financial Officer Doug MacLeod

Safety Review Internal Audit Report
Executive Summary
Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP as its Internal Audit provider to perform internal audits and
other consultative functions.

The audit team qualified eleven audit observations as Moderate Priority. As a result,
an overall report rating of ‘Needs Improvement’ was assigned.

This Safety review is a Board-approved Internal Audit Plan project.

The report’s Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations section describes the
observations, recommendations, and RTD’s management responses to address each
audit observation. Management has committed to completing the agreed-upon action
plans.

RubinBrown LLP prepared the report for use by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD
management.
Recommendations for improvement are presented for management’s consideration, and management is
responsible for effectively implementing corrective action plans.

Overall Rating

Objective and Scope

(See IA Report Appendices 2 and 3 for definitions)

The objectives of this review were to:
•

Report Rating Definitions
Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location,
process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. The design and
effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were isolated and/or minor, and
departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have certain
deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls which should be improved. Some departures from
leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or efficiency improvement or for improved
financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and the design or
effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures from leading practice may be
present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not corrected, the company can be exposed to loss
or financial misstatement.

Priority of Internal Audit Report Observations

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or
situations could occur which could have a significant adverse impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include
conditions dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts of interest, and control weaknesses. In
addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control,
and/or exposure of data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an exposure of confidentiality or
integrity.

High Priority

Moderate Priority

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following conditions:
• Significant financial impact for location/site audited
• Prevalence of issues or exceptions
• Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or regulatory requirements
• Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
• Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
• Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may be considered a high priority
classification.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.
Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial
statement errors and losses, operational inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory non-compliance as
well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and
Internal Audit.
Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to
improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next 12 months.

Risk Rating:

Safety Requirements

Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
The audit of the safety requirements stipulated in the Agreement disclosed the following:
•

The Concessionaire has not established a Fire/Life Safety Committee as required in the Agreement, Attachment 10,
Section 7.2 (f). The Fire/Life Safety Committee, which RTD is to support by participation in that committee's work,
is to oversee the Concessionaire’s safety program as well as to assist with emergency planning, and review hazard
analyses and safety certifications. The Fire/Life Safety Committee members are to consist of representatives from
emergency responders, RTD and the Concessionaire.

•

Evidence supporting that the Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) meetings are held no less than
every two months was not available. Section 7.2 (e) of Attachment 10 to the Agreement requires the
Concessionaire to establish an ESSC and to convene no less than every two months and more frequently if meeting
agenda items (action items) warrant.

•

The Hazard Identification Analysis and Resolution Process developed by the Concessionaire was last updated on
October 10, 2010. Section 7.3 of Attachment 10 to the Agreement requires the Concessionaire to use this process
to minimize or eliminate potential hazards, support early hazard identification, integrate safe operating procedures
into operations and maintenance and provide for constant and continuous safety evaluation and assessment.

Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Failure to establish a Fire/Life Safety Committee could lead to the likelihood of noncompliance with required safety
regulations.
Failure to maintain evidence that the ESSC convenes no less than every two months could impact the timeliness of
appropriate actions for safety and security issues.
Failure to update the Hazard Identification Analysis and Resolution Process could lead to hazards not being identified
and resolved in accordance with the latest regulations and best practices.

Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations

1.D.1.b

Report No. 2024-04 Denver Transit Partners Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: November 6, 2024

Recommendation:
•

Require the Concessionaire to establish a Fire/Life Safety Committee to oversee the Concessionaire’s safety
program and to work with other fire/life agencies to ensure an effective fire safety program that incorporates
standards for hazard analyses and safety certifications, emergency planning and response.

•

Request the Concessionaire to maintain evidence that the ESSC meetings are held no less than every two months.

•

Request the Concessionaire update the Hazard Identification Analysis and Resolution Process to ensure hazard
identification, analysis and mitigation are processed in accordance with the requirements outlined in the latest
applicable regulations and best practices.

Management Action Plan:
•

RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services has requested the Concessionaire to set up a Fire/Life Safety Committee for
the Operation and Maintenance period during the ESSC meeting in September 2024. The Concessionaire’s
operator, DTO, has acknowledged the need for a Fire/Life Safety Committee and will begin establishment of it.

•

Going forward, ESSC meetings will be held every two months based on day of week, coordinating schedules and
holidays and any other applicable factor.

•

RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services and RTD Commuter Rail Safety will audit on DTO’s process for compliance
with the Agreement and requirements. The audit will identify non-compliance issues and corrective action requests
for DTO to address.

Observation Title:
Passenger Conduct Code Requirement

Risk Rating:
Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
Evidence that the Concessionaire has developed a Passenger Conduct Code in accordance with the requirements
outlined in the Agreement was not provided during the audit. Per Section 7.1 of Attachment 10 to the Agreement
requires the Concessionaire to develop and submit a Passenger Conduct Code, which is consistent with established RTD
policy and applicable regulations. The Passenger Conduct Code shall be subject to review and approval by RTD and
should be posted in public areas and made available when required.
In addition, Internal Audit noted that there was no posting of the Passenger Conduct Code in public areas.
Cause:
An oversight by the RTD Commuter Rail to investigate the erroneous omission of the Passenger Conduct Code
requirement in the Customer Service Standards.
Risks:
Failure to develop and to communicate the Passenger Conduct Code could increase the likelihood of prohibited conduct
on the commuter lines.
Recommendation:
Require the Concessionaire to develop a Passenger Conduct Code in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the
Agreement to ensure the safety of passengers.
Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will review and ensure that the Concessionaire adopts the standards outlined in
RTD Code of Conduct and Suspension Policy in the Concessionaire’s Customer Service Standards. The RTD Code of
Conduct and Suspension Policy is applicable to any person or combination of persons on any RTD vehicle, facility, or
property.

Observation Title:
Operation Document Requirement

Risk Rating:
Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
The audit of the required documents for the operation and maintenance of the Concessionaire-operated components
disclosed the following:
•

Proof of review of the Operating Rules and Operating Procedure Book by RTD, FRA, the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission, and other relevant authorities from time to time was not available. The review by RTD and authorized
regulators is stipulated in Section 3.2.2 of the Operating Plan.

•

Evidence of the review and approval of the Management and Administration Plan by RTD was not documented.
Under Section 4.1 of Attachment 10 to the Agreement, the Management and Administration Plan is subject to
review and approval by RTD.

•

The Human Resources Plan was last revised by the Concessionaire on August 26, 2015. Evidence of review and
approval by the Concessionaire management was not documented prior to submittal to RTD. In addition, the
Human Resources Plan did not contain policies and procedures for promotion and return-to-service in accordance
with Section 4.8 of Attachment 10 to the Agreement.

Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Failure to review and approve the required documents could lead to misunderstanding of the required contractual
obligations.
Failure to update required documents and to include policies and procedures over key human resource activities could
lead to gaps between the actual human resource process and the specified requirements.
Recommendation:
•

Ensure review and approval of RTD and authorized regulators of the documents required for the operation and
maintenance of the Concessionaire-operated components are documented to minimize inaccuracies of the
information presented in the documents and to confirm compliance with the specified requirements.

•

Update the Human Resources Plan to ensure that the policies and procedures detailed in the Human Resources
Plan are relevant and compliant with the requirements and applicable regulations.

Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will work with Concessionaire and DTO to ensure upcoming submittals to
regulatory agencies are documented with the proper regulatory agencies and properly transmitted in the system of
record, Aconex, for review and approval by RTD.

Observation Title:
Service Task Order and Maintenance Requirement

Risk Rating:
Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of a sample of 25 service task orders that were randomly selected disclosed the following:
•

Seventeen service task orders were not investigated and resolved within the prescribed remedy time outlined in the
Service Task Orders, STO Remedy Times and Service Task Order Program (STOP) Points Table described in
Attachment 10 of the Agreement. Service task orders are prepared for incidents including cleanliness and odor,
elevator failure, CCTV cameras and equipment not working, graffiti, etc.

•

There was no evidence that the Service Task Order analysis was conducted on a monthly basis to identify systemwide or repeated service task order events that have occurred five or more times in a month and/or 10 or more
times in any 12-month period.

Additionally, Internal Audit noted that there has been no audit by RTD to verify the accuracy of the Concessionaire’s
service task order response times. Attachment 10 of the Agreement states that RTD reserves the right to periodically
audit actual performance and service task order response times against the Concessionaire's records and field checks.
The review of a randomly selected sample of 15 preventive maintenance work orders disclosed that the preventive
maintenance for four work orders were completed one week past the due date for the preventive maintenance
inspection based on the approved intervals specified in the Maintenance Plan. The explanation for the delays in the
preventive maintenance work order was not documented.
Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Failure to investigate service task orders within the prescribed remedy times could adversely impact the operation of
the commuter rail service.
Failure to perform preventive maintenance inspections on or before the due date could adversely impact the safety and
reliability of the commuter rail service.
Recommendation:
Request the Concessionaire to investigate and resolve service task orders within the prescribed remedy time outlined in
Attachment 10 of the Agreement.
Perform a review of the service task order process to ensure the requirements outlined in Attachment 10 and the
Management and Administration Plan/STOP are being followed by the Concessionaire and the STOP provisions are
assessed accurately.
Request the Concessionaire to complete preventive maintenance inspections by the due dates to ensure the rail transit
system, structures and other assets are operating safely, thereby increasing reliability and reducing the risk of hazards
and failures.

Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will continue to review STOP remedy times and points. RTD will be sending a
letter to the Concessionaire on the Agreement obligations related to the STOP requiring that the STOP provisions are
implemented accurately and Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) are submitted timely and are closed out properly. Pursuant
to Agreement Attachment 10 Section 3 (i) (STOP), DTP/O must successfully implement the actions described in the
approved RAP within the time periods specified therein. Thus, DTP/O must submit appropriate documentation to
demonstrate completion of the repair as outlined in the RAP or otherwise shall be considered a Persistent Condition and
shall result in the accrual of 10 STOP Points per occurrence, per month.
Pursuant to Agreement Section 29.8 and 32, RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will perform an audit(s) of DTO’s
Remedial Action Plan and STOP.
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will complete on-going reviews of monthly operating reports each month to
identify which preventive maintenance inspections are past due and identify trends on overdue completion of
preventive maintenance inspections. Communication will be submitted to the Concessionaire concerning which late
items and the associated reasons and steps to ensure compliance with the contractual requirements.

Operation and Maintenance Subcontract Agreements Requirement

Risk Rating:
Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that the operation and maintenance subcontractor agreements entered by the Concessionaire, or
the Operation and Maintenance Contractor have not been provided to RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services. Under
Section 9.4 (c) of the Agreement, the Concessionaire shall provide to RTD copies of all Subcontracts entered by the
Concessionaire and the Operation and Maintenance Contractor with any Material Operation and Maintenance
Subcontractor in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Concessionaire-operated Components.
Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Lack of information on material and maintenance subcontractor agreements could result in RTD being implicated in
potential disputes between the Concessionaire and subcontractors.
Recommendation:
Require the Concessionaire to provide copies of all existing subcontractor agreements entered by the Concessionaire
and the Operation and Maintenance Contractor to ensure agreements with material operation and maintenance
subcontractor are in writing and key terms and conditions including scope of work, payment terms, termination,
insurance, and indemnity are stated in the agreements.
Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will request the Concessionaire and DTO to communicate via Aconex, submitting
subcontractor agreements/contracts and ensuring RTD receives all copies of all current subcontractor agreements. RTD
Commuter Rail Contract Services will start with the DTO/Wabtec Master Service Agreement as this is one of DTO’s
largest contracts.

Audit and Records Requirement

Risk Rating:
Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that the Concessionaire has not consistently implemented management action plans to address
deficiencies noted by RTD or FRA. Section 32.1 (c) of the Agreement states that RTD or the Relevant Authority may
direct the Concessionaire to remedy any noncompliance with the terms of this Agreement or the Applicable
Requirements.
In addition, a formal audit and inspection plan detailing the nature, scope and frequency based on risk has not been
developed by the RTD Oversight Team.
Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Failure to implement corrective actions for noted deficiencies could result in noncompliance with contractual obligations
and regulation requirements.
Failure to develop a systematic audit and inspection plan could lead to noncompliance by the Concessionaire of its
obligations and regulatory requirements.
Recommendation:
Request the Concessionaire to implement corrective action plans to remedy noted deficiencies to ensure that the
deficiencies do not occur and to be compliant with the contractual requirements and regulation standards.
Develop a systematic and structure audit and inspection plan to ensure compliance with the contractually required
obligations and applicable regulations.
Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will develop a plan that systematically requires DTP/O to provide remediations to
deficiencies/defects found by FRA despite FRA stating no remedial action required. RTD Commuter Rail Contract
Services will add this as a discussion topic during the ESSC and bi-weekly Executive Issues meetings.
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will develop a schedule and plan for planned audits during the year and utilize
incident data to identify and prioritize target audits.

Payment of Rent Requirement

Risk Rating:
Low

Internal Audit Observation:
For contract year 2022, the rent payment from the Concessionaire to RTD was not made within the required timeframe
of January 18, 2022, and instead, the payment was made on March 3, 2022. The delay was due to RTD invoicing the
Concessionaire on February 16, 2022. Section 3 of the Agreement requires the Concessionaire to pay an annual rent of
U.S. $10 to RTD on the 10th Business Day of each Contract Year.
Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Failure to invoice the Concessionaire could increase the likelihood of untimely rent payments.
Recommendation:
Enforce the timelines of rent payment invoices to the Concessionaire to ensure the rent is paid by the due date
specified in the Agreement.
Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will create, schedule, and submit invoices two weeks prior to the end of the
previous operating period for the new operating period.

Internal Audit Observation:
Section 4.8.1(a) of Attachment 10 to the Agreement requires the Concessionaire to implement an annual program for
personnel training and competency testing for workforce compliance requirements, including its security and other
subcontractors. RTD shall review and concur with or request changes to this testing program. Internal Audit noted that
the Training and Competency developed by the Concessionaire had no evidence of review by RTD.
Section 4.8.1(b) of Attachment 10 to the Agreement requires the Concessionaire to provide its personnel, designated
contractors and relevant other commuter rail personnel with sufficient training and re-training, including formal written
examinations, to assure such personnel's capability to safely discharge their duties in accordance with relevant rules
and regulations. Internal Audit randomly selected a sample of 12 employees and noted the following:
•

Four employees have not completed the required training course.

•

Evidence of training attendance records for four employees were not provided.

•

Evidence of the instructor sign-off and date for eight employees was not provided. For the four training records
received, the sign-off by the instructor was not documented.

•

Evidence of completion of the required refresher course for five employees was not provided.

Additionally, the noted audit observations appear to be similar to the comments disclosed in the FRA inspection dated
May 2024.
Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Lack of contractual training requirement could adversely impact the ability of employees and subcontractors to perform
their duties safely, efficiently and in accordance with applicable regulations and the Agreement.
Recommendation:
•

Review and approve the Concessionaire’s Training and Competency Plan to ensure that the Concessionaire has
developed a comprehensive training for employees is a vital part of operating a safe, reliable, and cost-effective
commuter rail service.

•

Request the Concessionaire to ensure employees complete the required courses and evidential support with
regards to training attendance records, instructors’ sign-off and date are maintained in accordance with the training
requirement outlined in Attachment 10 of the Agreement and applicable regulation.

Management Action Plan:
RTD Commuter Rail Contract Services will review the Concessionaire’s training and competency program and provide
comments to the Concessionaire if not compliant with the requirements outlined in the Agreement.

Report No. 2024-04 Denver Transit Partners Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: November 6, 2024

Observation Title:
Accident/Incident Reporting

Risk Rating:
Moderate

Internal Audit Observation:
•

The review of the randomly selected sample of 14 accidents/incidents disclosed that three incidents were not
reported to RTD in writing within the required timeline of 24 hours. Section 29.6 (a) of the Agreement states that
the Concessionaire will respond as soon as possible to accidents, emergencies or other incidents and provide
prompt notice to RTD of any accidents, emergencies or other similar incidents. The Incidents, Accidents, and
Emergency Notification Procedure stipulates the submission of accidents/incidents within 24 hours of the
accident/incident occurrence.

•

Two of the 14 accidents/incidents caused delays greater than ten minutes and one of these incidents caused a
service disruption that required a bus bridge. Evidence of a phone call to RTD for these two accidents/incidents
was not provided. Per Incidents, Accidents, and Emergency Notification Standard Operating Procedure, RTD is to
be notified via phone call of accidents/incidents that cause train service delays greater than ten minutes and/or
cause service disruptions that require a bus bridge.

•

Internal Audit noted that the timelines for reporting accidents/incidents to RTD reflected in the Incidents,
Accidents, and Emergency Notification Procedure and the ReadyOp Messaging Procedures were not aligned.

•

In addition, there was one incident that involved damage of approximately $11,750 to rail equipment during
movement in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility; however, the supporting documentation did not indicate it
was reportable to FRA. Per Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 225, rail equipment accidents/incidents are to
be reported.

•

Internal Audit noted that the Passenger Train Emergency Preparedness Plan, dated March 11, 2022, has not been
reviewed and updated once every 24 months as required.

Cause:
Lack of adequate RTD oversight staffing to monitor the Concessionaire’s adherence to the contractual requirements.
Risks:
Failure to report accidents/incidents to RTD within the established timeframes could lead to the risk of untimely
corrective actions on preventing railroad accidents/incidents.
Failure to align the notification of accident/incident events could result in inconsistencies with the notification process.
Failure to record the accidents/incidents that meet the reportability requirements of FRA could result in inaccurate data
being submitted to FRA.
Failure to revise and update the Passenger Train Emergency Preparedness Plan could lead to ineffective responses to
passenger train emergencies.

Report No. 2024-04 Denver Transit Partners Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: November 6, 2024

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may
be considered a high-priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business
cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are
designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity. These
recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: November 6, 2024

Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP as its Internal
Audit provider to perform internal audits and other consultative
functions.

The audit team qualified eleven audit observations as
Moderate Priority. As a result, an overall report rating of
‘Needs Improvement’ was assigned.

This Safety review is a Board-approved Internal Audit Plan
project.
RubinBrown LLP prepared the report for use by the Board of
Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD management.
Recommendations for improvement are presented for
management’s consideration, and management is responsible
for effectively implementing corrective action plans.

Objective and Scope
The objectives of this review were to:
•

Determine whether RTD has established policies and
procedures over its safety program.

•

Determine whether RTD has developed and
implemented a Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan (PTASP) and a System Safety Program Plan
(SSPP) that addresses all applicable requirements and
standards set forth by the regulatory agencies.

•

Determine whether RTD adopted the Safety
Management System principles in developing its
PTASP.

•

Determine the adequacy of the internal controls
designed to prevent and detect safety risks, achieve
safety performance targets, and meet regulatory
requirements.

•

Determine whether safety personnel have the
necessary technical knowledge and skills to
successfully perform their jobs.

The report’s Internal Audit Observations and
Recommendations section describes the observations,
recommendations, and RTD’s management responses to
address each audit observation. Management has committed
to completing the agreed-upon action plans.

Policies and Procedures

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
A written statement of RTD’s Safety Policy is included in the safety plans as required by both the FTA and FRA. A
summary of the agency’s safety procedures is outlined in the mandated safety plans. However, Safety and
Environmental Compliance has not implemented a separate Safety Policy and Procedures Manual.
Safety and Environmental Compliance has implemented Integrated Contingency, Spill Prevention and Countermeasure,
Best Management Practices, and Stormwater Management plans. However, a comprehensive policy and procedure for
the Environmental Management and Hazardous Material Program has not been established.
The New Chemical Product Approval Procedures dated 2010 have not been updated to reflect the requirement to enter
approved products into Safetec, RTD’s electronic storage database for employees to view via the Hub.
The Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy and the ORM Framework were dated May 2022. It was noted in the
framework that the risk management process will be regularly evaluated to determine effectiveness, compliance, and
potential improvements; however, there was no evidence to support that the framework was reviewed and updated.
The CPUC noted in their 2022 Spring CPUC External Safety Audit that there was a lack of formalized documentation and
consistent implementation of policies and procedures in areas related to safety risk management and safety assurance.
Cause:
RTD has faced challenges with resourcing and staff turnover, which prevented the development and update of policies
and procedures and instead, the focus was on the day-to-day safety activities.
RTD has not established guidelines for reviewing and updating policies and procedures.
Risks:
Lack of formal documentation of the safety policy and procedures could result in noncompliance with safety regulatory
requirements.
Lack of guidelines for reviewing and updating policies and procedures could adversely impact the agency’s ability to
manage regulatory changes and evolving organization risks.

Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations

1.D.1.c

Report No. 2024-03 Safety Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: November 6, 2024

Observation 1

Develop a comprehensive Safety Policy and Procedures Manual detailing the key processes and activities for managing
safety that is aligned with the agency’s strategic safety objectives and goals and also, supports the required safety
plans.
Establish an environmental management and hazardous material program policy and procedure to provide a framework
for conforming with environmental and hazardous material regulations and creating awareness of the risks associated
with hazardous materials.
Collaborate with internal stakeholders, such as legal and compliance teams to establish a systematic approach to
reviewing and updating existing policies and procedures that impact the agency’s safety program.
Management Action Plan:
1. RTD has developed approved Agency Safety Policies in compliance with federal requirements. No Federal Transit
Administration mandate necessitates a separate Safety Policy and Procedures Manual. The agency’s current Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) are comprehensive and
effectively communicate all necessary safety policies and procedures.
2. Environmental Compliance staff will improve the existing environmental plans to ensure thorough tracking of safety
procedures and demonstrate compliance with regulatory and internal standards, the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division will develop a matrix that documents the review, amendment, and update process for all safety
procedures. This matrix will include the following elements:
•

•

•

Comprehensive Log of Policies and Procedures
•

Action: Track each policy or procedure reviewed, documenting the review date, responsible parties, and
scope of review.

•

Outcome: Ensures all policies and procedures are consistently evaluated for accuracy, relevance, and
compliance.

Detailed Record of Amendments and Updates
•

Action: Record any amendments or updates to policies or procedures, including rationale and effective
dates for changes.

•

Outcome: Provides a transparent history of changes, aiding in regulatory reviews and internal audits.

Reference for Compliance and Accountability
•

Action: Use the matrix as a primary reference for meeting regulatory and internal compliance needs,
linking each entry to relevant requirements.

•

Outcome: Serves as a single source of evidence for tracking procedural updates, ensuring the agency
remains compliant and that procedural changes are systematically documented.

3. Facility-level safety committees, along with the weekly internal safety and environmental operational risk
management meetings, are already conducting formal reviews of RTD’s ORM Policy and Framework. These reviews
ensure that the agency's risk exposures are comprehensively identified and managed in collaboration with relevant
RTD departments.

Observation 2

Fixed-Route Transit Service and Paratransit Service Contractors - Safety Plans

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that the third-party contractors operating RTD’s fixed route transit and paratransit service operations
have their own safety plans. Currently, there was no review of these safety plans by RTD’s Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.
Cause:
There is no mechanism in place to enforce the review of the safety plans of the third-party providers managing RTD’s
fixed route and paratransit services.
Risks:
Failure to integrate the safety plans for all modes of operations could lead to noncompliance with the applicable
regulatory requirements for safety.
Recommendation:
Establish procedures to integrate the safety plans of all modes of operations, including light rail, commuter rail, and
bus/paratransit to ensure integration of safety plans and collaboration on safety solutions for safety issues.
Monitor the safety plans of the paratransit service contractors to ensure compliance with the applicable statutory
requirements.
Management Action Plan:
The RTD Contract Oversight team actively monitors contractual performance metrics for third-party contractors. Based on
the requirements outlined in the contract language and 49 CFR 673, staff will develop a formal process to review and
evaluate the safety plans of third-party vendors managing RTD's fixed-route and paratransit services.

Observation 3

Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) - Risk Management Process

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The Safety and Environmental Division automated the tracking of safety hazards by implementing the Risk Register, a
Microsoft Lists application, effective May 2023. Internal Audit noted that the Risk Register was used to track identified
safety hazards, the associated safety risk assessments, and mitigation plans. It was noted that key safety procedures
outlined in PTASP, the ORM Framework, and the actual Risk Register process did not match. The noted gaps in the
procedures were in the following areas:
•

Use of local hazard logs to track safety hazards at the departmental level within RTD.

•

Transfer of safety hazard requiring mitigation plan, whose cost or changes are beyond that of the local safety
committee or department abilities, to the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division and subject to review by
the System Safety Working Group.

•

Hazards with high hazard ratings will be elevated from the local hazard log to the electronic hazard reporting
system.

•

Safety and Environmental Compliance Division hazard logs are used to track hazards identified by regulatory
agencies, accident investigations, and corrective action plan costs more than an estimate of $25,000.

•

Responsibility for maintaining Safety and Environmental Compliance Division hazard logs.

Cause:
RTD has faced challenges with resourcing and staff turnover, which prevented the updating of the PTASP and the ORM
Framework to reflect the current Risk Register process.
Risks:
Failure to update the PTASP and the ORM Framework for changes in safety processes could lead to noncompliance with
the regulatory requirements and inconsistencies in assessing safety hazards.
Recommendation:
Review and update the PTASP and the ORM Framework for changes in procedures affecting safety in a timely manner to
ensure consistency, efficiency, and compliance with applicable statutory requirements.
Management Action Plan:
The initial gaps in the risk register fields resulted from the Safety Team's learning curve during the transition from
non-networked Excel sheets to SharePoint lists, which provide additional functionalities. These administrative oversights
did not pose any risk to employees, operations, customers, or infrastructure and have since been addressed in the 2025
PTASP update. It is important to note that, due to the administrative requirements, the PTASP is updated annually.
Additionally, the ORM Framework will be revised separately to reflect the updated Risk Register process and its associated
controls.

a) PTASP – Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis
Review of 25 selected safety risks reported in the 2022 and 2023 Risk Register disclosed the following:
i.

Twenty-three safety risks had resolution time ranging from 80 days to 597 days.

ii.

Thirteen safety risks with “closed” status did not have the safety risk resolution date.

iii. Three safety risks were not assigned residual risk rankings upon completion of the risk evaluation.
iv. One safety risk was not assigned an initial and a residual risk ranking, and the subsequent resolution
requirement.
v. One safety risk ranked “3C Medium” did not have evidence of management review.

b) SSPP – Risk-Based Hazard Analysis
Review of ten selected safety risks reported in the 2022 and 2023 Risk Register disclosed the following:
i.

Three safety risks ranked “3C Medium” did not have evidence of management review. Internal Audit was
informed that these safety risks were reviewed by management; however, there was no evidence to
substantiate the management review.

ii.

One safety risk with “closed” status did not have the resolution date.

Cause:
This was due to the Risk Register process, which was implemented recently, requiring continuous improvement.
Risks:
Failure to process safety risks per the established guidelines could result in improper corrective actions to mitigate
identified safety risks.
Recommendation:
To improve the risk management process, management should implement the following:
•

Establish a timeframe for safety risk resolution.

•

Require the documentation of pertinent information regarding the evaluation and analysis of identified safety
risks to ensure appropriate corrective action plans are developed to eliminate safety hazards.

•

Document evidence of management review.

Safety Data Collection and Analysis

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that a mechanism for safety data collected from numerous sources including employee safety
reporting program, safety event reporting, facilities and equipment inspections, safety committees’ meetings, etc. for
analysis to identify safety-related trends has not been implemented.
Cause:
A practical approach for safety collection and data analysis has not been identified by the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.
Risks:
Lack of safety collection and analysis could impact the agency’s ability to monitor the effectiveness of its safety program.
Recommendation:
Establish a mechanism for safety data collection, documentation and analysis from internal sources as well as external
sources such as State Safety Oversight Program, National Transit Database, etc. to determine safety trends and patterns
in order to develop strategies to support safety awareness and responsiveness.
Management Action Plan:
RTD gathers safety data from multiple sources, including facility safety inspections, daily reports, and on-the-job injury
data. This data is used for safety data analysis, generating monthly reports for the Leadership Safety Committee. These
reports guide strategic resource allocation to address high-risk areas, ensuring continuous monitoring and improvement
of safety performance.

PTASP - Personal Protective Equipment

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that RTD has not established a policy for classifying Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Currently,
the PPE classification is inconsistent throughout the agency. Additionally, there was no enforcement to ensure the
standardization of PPE classification.
Cause:
Historically, RTD has not mandated a standard PPE classification.
Risks:
Lack of PPE classification and enforcement could result in improper PPE that will cause workplace injuries.
Recommendation:
Establish PPE classification procedures to safeguard employees, contractors, and visitors against hazards or harmful
workplace conditions.
Monitor the use of PPE to ensure enforcement and compliance with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards.
Management Action Plan:
No enterprise-wide policy classifies PPE; however, RTD has implemented higher-level controls that provide multiple layers
of protection. This absence of a PPE policy presents an opportunity for continuous improvement rather than a significant
risk. The Safety and Environmental Division will explore this improvement opportunity during future job hazard
identification and risk assessment consultations while addressing corrective actions related to developing and
implementing enterprise-wide safety training initiatives.
Responsibility:
Richard Lobato, Acting Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental Compliance Division
Target Date:
June 30, 2025 (this is a multi-year effort and will adjust as new equipment and processes are introduced into the agency)

SSPP – Process and Procedures

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
RTD’s SSPP for commuter rail, which is dated July 30, 2021, was approved by the FRA on October 8, 2021. Internal Audit
noted that the following key safety procedures outlined in RTD’s SSPP have not been updated to reflect the current
processes.
a) Element 12: Accident/Incident Reporting and Investigation states that the RTD Accident/Incident Investigation
Policy is the basis for documenting the underlying cause of accident and incidents, identifying existing or potential
hazards, and determining the best course to reduce or eliminate these hazards. However, it was noted that the
commuter rail accidents and incidents were processed in accordance with the Event Notification, Reporting and
Investigation Procedures.
b) Element 15: Risk-Based Hazard Management Program (RBHMP) states that RTD has established an RBHMP for
inclusion in the SSPP and will continually review and update the RBHMP, which will be fully implemented within
three years of FRA approval of the SSPP. Currently, the ORM Framework is used as the risk-based management
program for the commuter rail safety operation.
c) Element 16: Risk-Based Hazard Analysis states that RTD uses the MIL STD 882, Department of Defense Standard
Practice for system safety to determine hazard severity and probability of identified hazards in order to develop
appropriate corrective action plans. Currently, the Operational Risk Assessment Matrix is used to determine the
severity and probability and consequently the risk ranking to initiate the appropriate control measures and/or
mitigation actions.
Cause:
RTD has faced challenges with resourcing and staff turnover within Commuter Rail, which prevented full implementation
of the requirements outlined in the SSPP.
Risks:
Failure to update the procedures outlined in the SSPP to reflect the actual practices for accident and incident notification,
reporting and investigation, and hazard risk management could result in noncompliance with the FRA SSPP regulations.
Failure to adhere to the elements of the approved SSPP could result in penalties.
Recommendation:
Establish processes and procedures aligned with the FRA SSPP regulations' requirements for accident/incident reporting
and investigation and risk-based risk management.
Update the SSPP in a timely manner to ensure events and hazards that impact commuter rail safety is processed
consistently and efficiently to ensure the elimination or mitigation of safety risks from all activities to an acceptable level.

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that the following safety critical elements were not assessed annually as required by the SSPP.
a) Element 5: Implementation Process
b) Element 16: Risk-Based Hazard Analysis
c) Element 17: technology Analysis and Implementation Plan
In addition, the SSPP has not been updated to reflect changes in the FRA Confidential Close Call Reporting System.
Internal Audit noted that the SSPP training plan with each operator’s training manager to identify employees who are
responsible for implementation and support of the System Safety Program has not been implemented.
Additionally, there was no supporting documentation to substantiate that the commuter rail personnel completed the
SSPP training and passed the written examination.
Cause:
RTD has faced challenges with resourcing and staff turnover within Commuter Rail, which prevented full implementation
of the requirements outlined in the System Safety Program Plan.
Risks:
Failure to comply with the requirements specified in the SSPP could result in noncompliance with the requirements and
standards stipulated by the FRA’s SSPP regulation.
Recommendation:
Establish processes and procedures to address all the requirements and standards as set forth in the SSPP.
Update the SSPP with the appropriate processes and procedures to ensure compliance with the applicable statutory
regulations.
Management Action Plan:
These administrative issues have been identified and are being addressed through the SSPP review and update efforts.
The Safety and Environmental Division are in various stages of completion, ensuring compliance and continuous
improvement.

Accident Notification, Reporting, and Investigation Process

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:

PTASP – Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting
Review of the selected sample of five light rail and 25 bus accidents and incidents that occurred in 2022 through 2023
disclosed the following:
a) There was no evidence to support that a post event meeting within 72 hours of the event was conducted for the
bus accidents and incidents that occurred after June 2023. The 72-hours post event meeting was implemented in
June 2023.
b) One light rail accident dated August 21, 2023, which was originally categorized as a 24-hour reportable accident,
was subsequently changed to a two-hour reportable accident; however, it was not submitted to the CPUC within
the two-hour required threshold.
c) One bus accident dated June 29, 2023 did not have a Transportation Loss Report. Bus drivers are required to
complete a Transportation Loss Report.

SSPP – Accident/Incident Reporting and Investigation
Review of the selected sample of 10 of commuter rail accidents and incidents that occurred in 2022 through 2023
disclosed the following:
a) Ten commuter rail accidents/incidents did not have supporting documentation evidencing the underlying cause of
the accident and incident analysis, and the recommended corrective actions to reduce the risk. Additionally, there
was no analysis to support that the commuter rail accidents did not meet the FRA accident reportable criteria.
b) One of the 10 commuter rail accidents/incidents was classified as "collision"; however, there was no
documentation to support if the accident met the reportable accident criteria threshold outlined in the FRA SSPP
regulation.
Cause:
The various divisions within the agency that are involved in accident and incident investigation and reporting are at
varying maturity stages as it relates to implementation of the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation policy and
procedure.
Risks:
Failure to process accidents following the requirements specified in the SSPP and PTASP could result in noncompliance
with the statutory regulations.
Recommendation:
Require the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division and Investigation Team staff to follow accident reporting and
investigation procedures to ensure that reportable events are evaluated in accordance with the requirements and
standards stipulated in the FTA and FRA regulations.

Internal Audit Observation:
A review of selected samples of facilities and equipment inspections, specifically those conducted between 2022 and
2023, revealed the following:

PTASP – Inspections, Field/Co-op Audits, and Reviews
a. The monthly facility inspections were not conducted for the following light rail facilities:
i. Navajo Facility for June 2022, July 2022, June 2023, and August 2023.
ii. Elati Facility in October 2022.
b. A monthly bus facility inspection was not completed for the Platte Division in June 2023.

SSPP – Maintenance, PTASP - Inspections, Field/Co-op Audits, and Reviews
There was no supporting documentation evidencing that a combination of facility maintenance personnel and the
equipment owner conducted periodic inspections of the commuter rail fixed facilities and equipment.
Cause:
Inconsistency with the monthly inspections, field/co-op audits and safety reviews of the maintenance facilities and
equipment.
Risks:
Failure to conduct facility inspections following the requirements specified in the PTASP and the SSPP could result in
noncompliance with applicable statutory regulations.
Recommendation:
Require the inspections and testing of facilities and equipment by employees, supervisors, managers, and Safety and

Internal Audit Report
Issued: November 6, 2024

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business
cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are
designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity. These
recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.
