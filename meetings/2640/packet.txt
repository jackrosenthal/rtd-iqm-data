It is further recommended that the Contract end date be extended from December
31, 2018 until December 31, 2019 to complete work on the North Metro and SERE

Budget for the specific projects for which Kumar’s services are utilized.

documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy
up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services herein referenced as

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement
for Federal Liaison Services with Squire Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at a
cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December 31, 2018). This action represents
the fourth year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is included in the
annual budget.

G.

Approval of General Manager's 2017 Performance Evaluation

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s
performance appraisal for 2017 as defined in the attached completed General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation Packet. The General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee is pleased to report they are in agreement
with General Manager Genova’s self-assessments and feel he has achieved or
exceeded his overall goals for the 2017 Performance Appraisal. Although it has
been a challenging year, the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee recognizes that General Manager Genova has met the
“Exceeds Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task Goals and
“Achieved Expectations” for the remaining Task Goals set forth for performance in
2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding performance in leading the RTD
and the overall compensation philosophy is to hire and maintain top talent in
keeping with the industry compensation of transit leadership peers we feel General
Manager Genova has earned a discretionary performance payment of $11,400.00.
This is an increase of 4% over last year.
H.

TMD Contract Amendment

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee to approve an
amendment to the Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) Contract
14DO009, awarded in March 2015, to exercise the two remaining one-year option
periods thereby extending the Contract period of performance to December 31,
2019 and to increase the contract amount by $650,000 from $500,000 to a new
Not to Exceed (NTE) total of $1,150,000.
I.

Free Rides for Members of the Military

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free
rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be
extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2017 to December
31, 2018. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal
impact on RTD.

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2018 Recommended Budget (combined Base and
FasTracks) is $1,300.4 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $675.6 million, interest
expense of $153.2 million, capitalized interest of $21.4 million, new capital expenditures of $187.8
million, debt payments of $64.7 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks
Internal Savings Account of $71.5 million, contingency reserve of $5.0 million, Board-appropriated fund
of $33.3 million, capital replacement fund of $12.9 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $14.7
million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $44.3 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry-forward) is $743.5 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry-forward
is $2,043.9 million.
Overview of the 2018 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,213.4 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $34.9 million
(3.0%) in 2018 from the 2017 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) an increase in farebox
revenue of $4.3 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $40.1 million, 3) an increase
in investment income of $3.1 million, and 5) an increase in other revenue of $0.3 million, offset
by a decrease in grant revenue of $12.9 million.



Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $146.8 million is budgeted to
increase 3.0% over the 2017 Amended Budget. Farebox revenue is forecasted on the
basis of a fare revenue model now being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue
between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors. The model uses
ridership forecasts and current data on average fare paid per boarding. Based on the
model, in 2018 a higher proportionate amount of fare revenue is allocated to Base and a
lower amount is allocated to FasTracks than in previous periods.
On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to increase almost 1% over the 2017
Amended Budget to $115.2 million in 2018.
For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 11.6% to $31.6 million over the
2017 budgeted amount.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat on Base with ridership increases attributed to
FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.4% in 2018 over that projected
for 2017.
Sales and use tax revenue of $626.2 million in 2018 is expected to increase 4.9% over
the 2017 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the
CU-Leeds School of Business. The same forecast was used in the 2018-2023 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP).
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $414.4
million, a decrease of $12.9 million from the 2017 Amended Budget. Total Base System
grants are estimated to total $146.9 million in 2018; of that amount, $90.0 million is new
grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is $56.9 million. Base System grants
are projected to decrease $3.4 million from the 2017 Amended Budget. The decrease
reflects grant draws for LRT overhaul work and Civic Center that were made in 2017
instead of 2018.

FasTracks grants are budgeted at $267.5 million, which is a decrease of $9.4 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget largely due to lower final draws on the FFGA and decreases in
certain CMAQ grants.
Combined investment income of $7.3 million is projected to increase $3.1 million over the
2017 Amended Budget due to expectation of somewhat higher interest rates on investable
fund balances.
Other operating income and other income together will increase by $0.3 million from the
2017 Amended Budget generally due to CPI increases on recurring income such as rental
and joint venture income. The Build America Bonds subsidy of $8.8 million for FasTracks
Project is not increased at the CPI. Other income also includes full-year payment by the
University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line (FasTracks Operations) and DUS
rental income (Base).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $675.6 million on a combined basis in 2018 (excluding
depreciation), which is $13.6 million higher compared to the 2017 Amended Budget. Base
System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $25.9 million, FasTracks Project operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $19.5 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses
are budgeted to increase $7.1 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses
are targeted amounts derived from the SBP, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in
the 2018-2023 SBP, plus operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2017, and other
miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For FasTracks Operations, the
increase is generally due to both direct costs and full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs
of operating the new service corridors, including additional security services, and a higher
estimated service payment to Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance.
For FasTracks Project, the decrease is due to completion of several FasTracks projects and
capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors. For FasTracks, operating expenses
are derived from the Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2018 is $19.0 million for Base System, $20.9
million for FasTracks Project, and $0.9 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and
maintenance projects approved in the SBP (Base System) for 2018 total $13.3 million (in 2017
dollars). It should be noted that reductions were made overall to departmental operating budgets
including expense projects to bring expenditures into alignment with the SBP and APE.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at an estimated price of $1.80 per gallon, compared to a lock price of
$1.69 per gallon in the 2017 Amended Budget, resulting in an incremental higher cost of
approximately $1.1 million over 2017. Senior staff is reviewing opportunities to lock diesel at a
favorable price for 2018. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, which is the same price as in
the 2017 budget for no change.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of additions for approved SBP expense projects and expense projects carryforward, as well as start-up costs for North Metro operations not determined in the Requested
Budget.
The 2018 Recommended Budget includes funding for the first year of start-up costs related to
future RTD operation of the North Metro commuter rail line. The expense budget of $3.9 million

Packet Pg. 14

2.11.A

covers staffing, consumables and spare parts to be purchased for maintenance of the
infrastructure and passenger facilities, and training and other support needed to prepare for
revenue service. The capital budget of $13.4 million covers the first year of facilities
modifications and heavy equipment to be purchased to support revenue service.
Interest expense in 2018 is budgeted at $153.2 million on a combined basis, a decrease of $2.2
million from the 2017 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to the effect of refundings and
rescheduled amortization. Of total interest expense, $21.8 million is budgeted for Base System
and $131.5 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks interest expense includes the TABOR
interest expense of $34.4 million which is paid with the DTO service payment.
Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $21.4 million, all of which will occur in FasTracks
Project for the North Metro debt. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for
interest payments in 2018.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $64.7 million on a combined basis, which is $6.6
million higher than the 2017 Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $59.0 million
are $9.0 million higher due to re-scheduled amortization of debt through refundings. FasTracks
principal payments of $5.7 million are $2.4 million lower due to re-scheduled amortization of
debt through refundings. No new debt issuances are planned in 2018 for either the Base System
or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and
construction in 2018.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2017 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2018. The
capital carry-forward will be $743.5 million made up of $104.8 million on the Base System and
$638.7 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $187.8 million on a combined basis will decrease $114.5 million from
the 2017 Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital spending
for FasTracks will decrease $105.9 million to $128.9 million in 2018 due to on-going project
completion, mainly North Metro, offset by an increase to the East corridor for reconciliation of
finance charges. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $8.6 million from the
2017 Amended Budget to $58.9 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $5.6
million less on facilities construction and maintenance (mainly Customer Care Center relocation,
Blake entryway remodel, and fire protection), $6.2 million less on bus Infrastructure (16 th Street
Mall reconstruction), $1.4 million less on Park-n-Rides (US36 & Sheridan station), $0.9 million
less on rail transit and infrastructure (several projects), and $12.7 million less on fleet
modernization and expansion (all vehicles except for ADA). These decreases will be offset by
$10.4 million more on capital support projects (Burnham Yard land purchase, Colfax 15L Route
Improvement project, and blank out screens on Welton Street), $4.6 million more on rail
construction (downtown track and switches replacement and Central corridor rail replacement),
and $3.2 million more on capital support equipment (support and service vehicles and in-plant
equipment). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in
October 2017 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects within SOGR
priorities.
Regarding the Colfax 15L Route Improvement project, capital funds were approved in the SBP as
$4,638,103 in 2018 and $1,625,000 in 2019. In this 2018 Recommended Budget, the project
funding will be revised so that funds from 2019 will move to 2018 to allow for a bid on the

Packet Pg. 15

2.11.A

construction contract in early 2018. Thus, the project amount for 2018 will be $6,263,103 (in
2017 dollars) and the amount for 2019 will be $0.
New capital expenditures for 2018 and the change in new capital in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2018 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward
expenditures for 2018 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2017 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve changes include an increase in the Base System
year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2017 Amended Budget to $31.4 million. This
projected fund balance is in alignment with the SBP target after incorporating all revenue and
expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that
projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2017 (this will become
evident in the 2018 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is
projected to increase by $3.0 million to $20.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected
to decrease by $2.7 million to $0, and the unrestricted operating reserve is projected to increase
by $5.0 million to $14.7 million.
A $5.0 million contingency reserve is created for the first time for the Base System. The
purpose of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through the fiscal year.
The funds will be used at the General Manager’s discretion to fund unbudgeted inflationary
increases, respond to emergencies, new regulations, and cover cost overruns.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the reserve funds are maintained at 3 months of
operating expenses. Additionally, the FasTracks management reserve is budgeted at $15.9
million and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted at $71.5 million.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund,
the unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase
$23.6 million over the 2017 Amended Budget. These increases are in minimum accordance with
fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks
Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2018 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox
revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and
expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2018 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both
the Base System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently
for the Base System. The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital
acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding

Packet Pg. 16

2.11.A

depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The 2018 budget reflects maintenance of a
FasTracks management reserve at a level deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these fund balances (excluding the management reserve) for 2018 on a District-wide
basis is projected at $105.3 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $33.3
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $12.9 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of
$14.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $44.3 million. The
Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2018 is projected to total $66.5 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2018 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2018 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2018 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2017. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2017, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed re-appropriated."

Associates and increase the contract Not-to-Exceed amount by $1,000,000. This will result in a new
Not-to-Exceed contract amount of $6,000,000 for Construction Materials Testing and Inspection
Services.
It is further recommended that the Contract end date be extended from December 31, 2018 until
December 31, 2019 to complete work on the North Metro and SERE projects. Funds for the amendment
are contained in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific projects for which Kumar’s services are
utilized.
BACKGROUND
On July 15, 2008, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Kumar and
Associates spanning August 1, 2008 through December 31, 2013, for an initial Not-to-Exceed amount
of $5,000,000. The contract also allowed for the exercise of up to five option years beyond the initial
contract period. The Not-to-Exceed amount was only expected to cover the initial contract period, with
increases to the Contract amount negotiated at each annual amendment.
Since 2008, the contract has been amended annually based on the scope of work for the year,
which included both FasTracks and Base System projects. After the initial five years and five
months, RTD exercised its option years in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017; and yet in the nearly 9½
years since contract award the Not-to-Exceed amount has never been increased. The 2018
workscope will require an increase the Contract price.
DISCUSSION
The Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services Contract was specified for an initial term of
five years and five months, with five option years, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s
work scope. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks
and deliverables responded to the needs of RTD’s capital programs.
Kumar and Associates is a locally-based DBE firm that provides 1) Acceptance Testing of construction
materials such as concrete and soils for RTD’s smaller projects, 2) Verification Testing for large projects
whereby the contractor has been tasked with Acceptance Testing, and 3) audits of contractor testing
procedures, personnel, and equipment. They can also provide specialized testing and inspections for
unique applications such as micro-pile installation at Civic Center, weld inspections, etc.
Specific projects that will require Kumar’s support in 2018 include:

North Metro Rail Line

Projects that will require Kumar’s support in 2019 will be limited to those in which Kumar has had an
ongoing role that requires continuity of effort, namely:
 North Metro Rail Line
 Southeast Rail Extension
RTD has established a 12% DBE Goal for this Contract. However, since Kumar and Associates is a
certified DBE, 100% of the work counts toward the DBE Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific
projects whereby Kumar’s services will be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to increase
the board authorized contract amount with Kumar and Associates by $1,000,000 for a total Notto-Exceed amount of $6,000,000; and that the Contract end date be extended to December 31,
2019. Funds for the contract authorization are included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for
the specific projects where Kumar’s services are utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Rather, authorize the General Manager to increase the
board authorized contract amount with Kumar and Associates by $500,000 for a total Not-toExceed amount of $5,500,000; and keep the Contract end date at December 31, 2018. Funds
for the contract authorization are included in the 2018 Recommended Budget for the specific
projects where Kumar’s services are utilized. This is not recommended at this time, as this
would cause a break in responsibilities at a critical time in two major corridor projects, with little
time for a new testing contractor to learn the project history and strengths/weaknesses of the
design-builders’ quality programs.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, transfer the scope of work to one of the
other support contracts. This is not recommended since Kumar is satisfactorily performing as a
prime contractor with RTD and has deferred working with any of our construction contractors to
avoid conflicts of interest. Any other consultants working for RTD would have to sub-contract
this work out to one of the few qualified testing firms in the local area, most of which are
working or have worked for our contractors.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
contract amendment to Kumar and Associates. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
testing contractor. This is not recommended at this time, as Kumar is satisfactorily performing its
work assignments on all of RTD’s current projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that RTD will
procure a new materials testing contract in 2018 to take over testing for any new projects.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

Subject:

Longmont Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the City of Longmont to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route
services herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and
327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. Boulder County received funding from the City of Longmont to assist in the buy up
program. The Boulder County contract to buy up service will expire in December 2017. The City of
Longmont would like to continue the Longmont Free Fare program for a period of two years. This
contract would be in effect January 2018 – December 2019.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined
in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build
ridership and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of
the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County
and City of Longmont, have performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with
the approval of RTD Marketing. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 24 month period, the City of Longmont has agreed to reimburse the RTD $130,602 in
advance in 6 month periods. Additionally, the city has agreed to reimburse the RTD fares for all Accessa-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. The City also
agreed that if the RTD has a fare increase, all dollars amounts will be adjusted to reflect any fare
increases. There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the City or RTD to
discontinue the program with 60 days’ notice.

Packet Pg. 41

2.12.C

Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the
Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). By the end of 2016,
boardings increased to 373,204.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up.
2. Do not approve the Agreement with the City of Longmont for the 300 series buy up. This course of
action is not recommended, as it will result in a loss of a program valuable to the City of Longmont
and Boulder County. Additionally, this program provides transportation access to the low-income
population. Local ridership will be reduced as customers are charged a fare and lose the ability to
travel at any time.

Subject:

2018 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 8, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2018.

BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November 2016
for the 2017 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to: 1) maintaining a total fund balance for the
Base System at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses
excluding depreciation among the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the
remaining unrestricted fund balance; and for FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund and
unrestricted fund balance would be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three months of
FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation; 2) designation of an unrestricted operating reserve
fund on an annual basis, to be used to mitigate service or project disruptions due to revenue
fluctuations, meet unanticipated non-recurring expenditures, or avoid cash flow disruptions, and to be
replenished promptly; 3) the maintenance of only the FasTracks Management Reserve for future
construction; and 4) clarification that the FISA will be used to complete and operate additional FasTracks
projects with expenditures subject to Board approval. The Policy Statement was also updated with the
most recent rating agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2018, the only changes proposed are for wording clarification and are reflected in the attachment.
This consists of reference to the APE where necessary, and the substitution of the word “monetize” for
“sell” in Revenue Policies #6.
Debt Policies #5 is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this date.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2018
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approval and adoption of the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2018.
2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies
and welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) and Annual Program Evaluation (APE). As part of this process, staff will review
potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the SBP
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to sellmonetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.
7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (sixyear SBP and APE period) and long-term (30-year Financial Plan period). The purpose
is to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts
using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks APE and/or financial plan (see #7
below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP and APE as the
basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks APE which will be integrated
with the SBP incorporating the actual costs incurred and the most recent available
projections of capital improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and
revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources

unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

2018 Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 8, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2016. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. One Minor change is recommended this year for clarification
sake.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1. PURPOSE

2.12.E.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 58

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

3.3 Yield

2.12.E.a

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
3
Packet Pg. 59

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-17 REDLINE (3314 : 2018 Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the
security is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.

2.12.E.a

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

2.12.E.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 1, 2017

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 1, 2017

Board Meeting Date: November 7, 2017

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at a cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December 31, 2018).
This action represents the fourth year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is included in the
annual budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This solicitation
was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten responsive
proposals were received, and they were evaluated by an evaluation committee that recommended Squire
Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was subsequently referred to the
Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014. The Government Relations Committee
recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract for a five-year period. Squire
Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5
billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant monitoring of Congressional and Executive
Branch activities, status reports are issued and special reports are prepared when required by the Board
of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process.
The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST) was passed on December 4, 2015, and the
federal lobbyists played a key role in representing RTD’s needs in this reauthorization bill. With the build
out of FasTracks, the lobbyists need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new
corridors, and they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new plans
for the Executive Office’s infrastructure bill to be introduced sometime in the near future. When the bill
is revealed, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to the contents of the bill and
monitoring the amendments and progress of the proposed language.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the US Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and

Packet Pg. 69

2.13.F

assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation, as well as
advising staff on proper protocols for these agencies.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves in an important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December 31,
2018). This action represents the fourth year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is
included in the annual budget.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor (Squire
Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability in liaison
services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Federal
Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was properly
utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals were reviewed and subjected to the evaluation
criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—pursuant to RTD’s longstanding procurement procedures.

General
Performance Evaluation

Manager's

2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance appraisal for 2017 as defined in the
attached completed General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Packet. The General Manager Oversight
and Performance Management Committee is pleased to report they are in agreement with General
Manager Genova’s self-assessments and feel he has achieved or exceeded his overall goals for the 2017
Performance Appraisal. Although it has been a challenging year, the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee recognizes that General Manager Genova has met the “Exceeds
Expectations” for all of the Core Goals and one of the Task Goals and “Achieved Expectations” for the
remaining Task Goals set forth for performance in 2017. Based on the consistent and outstanding
performance in leading the RTD and the overall compensation philosophy is to hire and maintain top
talent in keeping with the industry compensation of transit leadership peers we feel General Manager
Genova has earned a discretionary performance payment of $11,400.00. This is an increase of 4% over
last year.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year setting goals for the following year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
process as the salaried employee performance evaluation. That process was used in the 2017 GM
performance appraisal process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have moved through the process of the 2017 performance evaluation utilizing the policies set on July
10, 2010, through the recommendation by the State Legislative Audit Committee.

Subject:

TMD Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee to approve an amendment to the Transportation
Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) Contract 14DO009, awarded in March 2015, to exercise the two
remaining one-year option periods thereby extending the Contract period of performance to December
31, 2019 and to increase the contract amount by $650,000 from $500,000 to a new Not to Exceed
(NTE) total of $1,150,000.
BACKGROUND
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) currently provides on-call service planning assistance
to RTD under the terms of Contract 14DO009. TMD has been selected on three different occasions
through RTD’s Request for Proposal (RFP) process over the last 15 years to perform a variety of service
planning studies for projects which require more time or specific expertise than RTD Service
Development staff have available. Previous projects have included the restructuring of bus services
associated with the opening of the A-Line rail service, the B-Line rail service, the R-Line rail service, and
the planned opening of the G-Line rail service. TMD is currently working with RTD to provide assistance
in the restructuring of bus service associated with the planned opening of the N-Line rail service. In
addition, TMD has provided assistance with various transit priority studies.
DISCUSSION
RTD has found TMD’s analysis and recommendations to be thorough and well documented, allowing
RTD staff to propose appropriate changes through a timely and responsive process we would otherwise
not be able to accomplish in a timely manner. TMD is currently working with RTD on the restructuring
of bus service to accompany the planned opening of the N-Line rail service. Additional future projects
include: analysis of potential transit priority applications, transfer analysis, analysis of ridership patterns,
analysis of potential bus stop consolidation activities, streamlining routes and frequent route network
analysis. TMD planning assistance is provided to RTD on an on-call basis through the issuance of
specific task orders for each specific project/task.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has approved an additional $50,000 in the adopted 2017 Budget as amended. $300,00 is included
in the 2018 RTD budget request currently under consideration by the RTD Board of Directors. Future
funding requests will be included in future year’s budget requests.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve the exercise of the two one-year option periods with TDM
and increase the contract Not to Exceed (NTE) by $650,000. Individual task orders, each with a
specific NTE amount will be released for each project. The total Contract NTE amount will not
exceed $1,150,000.
2. Further modify the NTE increase. This is not recommended because it will delay the implementation

of these services.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the two one-year option periods or to increase the
NTE dollar amount with TDM. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the
opportunity to continue with these important service-related studies.

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2017. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2017 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.
