## II. November Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Hoy reviewed the Board Meeting agenda and said that it included an updated recommended action from the General Manager Oversight and Performance Review Committee (GM Oversight). He asked whether that was the only change to the agenda, and Ms. McManus said yes. He noted the items on the unanimous consent and recommended action agendas and said that he would assume that no additional items needed to be moved to recommended actions unless someone said otherwise.

Director Deadwyler asked how many retirees would be in attendance for the Board Meeting.

Chair Hoy said there were three retirees on the agenda.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operating Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said it would be prudent to note that the Board Meeting would open with the consideration of the budget.

Chair Hoy agreed and said the budget was an item for public discussion, meaning there would be two opportunities for public comment.

Motion:              Chair Hoy made the motion to approve moving the November 28th Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Vote on

the Motion               The motion passed with 5 in favor and 0 opposed.

## III. Other Matters

Director Francone noted the agenda would show both the GM Oversight update and the committee’s recommended action.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board had gone into executive session before when speaking about the General Manager’s performance.

Barbara McManus, Board Office Executive Manager, stated that GM Oversight did not go into executive session during its last meeting.

Chair Hoy stated the GM Oversight committee members felt an executive session was not needed, nor was there an executive session scheduled for the Board Meeting. He said he would find out during the Board Meeting if that was a mistake.

Director Francone said she wanted to have an open and fair discussion and to allow the General Manager to respond.

Director Deadwyler asked how many Directors attended the previous GM Oversight committee.

Chair Hoy said seven or eight Directors. He noted that, for the recommended action regarding the General Manager’s performance evaluation, he would ask Director Francone to lead the discussion.

Director Francone noted that the Bike Jeffco organization would be in attendance for the Board Meeting to ask for a review of RTD’s bicycle policy. She said she anticipated three people would attend from that group. She suggested that an ad hoc committee be created that could serve in an advisory capacity.

Chair Hoy said he would listen to the request from Bike Jeffco and decide where to go from there.

Director Francone said that Bike Jeffco’s representatives were reasonable, passionate about what they were doing, and had good information for staff. She said it would be helpful to revisit the policy regarding bicycle stowage and the use of the high blocks.

Chair Hoy suggested that the Bike Jeffco representatives could sit in on an ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) meeting. She said they might be able to get a better global look at what it means to be on a high block with wheelchair users.

Director Francone responded that Bike Jeffco was informed and engaged and had partnered with the disabled community. She said they realize that persons with mobility devices or mobility impairment would have first priority in using the high block. She said she was surprised to learn the number of people with bicycles who used light rail. She noted that RTD as an agency was pushing first/last mile solutions and stated that bicycles were one of the ways people solved that issue. She suggested people might use public transit more if they had better accommodations.

Chair Hoy noted that he had carried his bike onto a train many times.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the bicycle users intended to use the disabled areas.

Chair Hoy said that the bicycle users’ rights were to subordinate to those of persons with disabilities.

Director Deadwyler said she could foresee bikes overloading the trains.

Director Menten asked whether the video showing the adjusted seating arrangement of the train cars, which would allow people to understand how much room mobility devices require, had been posted on the RTD website.

Mr. Abel said he would check.

Director Deadwyler said that the agency would receive pushback.

Mr. Abel said that what the stakeholders were asking was for a review of bicycle policy and to be able to participate, which would not be resolved immediately.

Directors Francone and Deadwyler requested a copy of the bicycle policy, and Ms. McManus responded that she would provide copies.

General Manager Genova reminded the committee that a recent settlement was the reason for the train car reconfiguration, which needed to be taken into consideration.

Director Francone said they were aware of the lawsuit and ADA priority and the implications of sharing that area. She said the Bike Jeffco representatives were reasonable and were looking to have a discussion about whether more bikes could be safely accommodated on light rail, rather than asking for additional train cars exclusively for bicycles.

Mr. Abel said that Bike Jeffco’s participation would allow them to be involved in the conversation and to understand perspectives but noted that the settlement would be the guiding force.

Director Walker said that he rode light rail frequently and noted that bicycles, if placed in the middle of a train car, could easily trap people trying to escape in an emergency. He said the reason for the lawsuit was that RTD could not accommodate everyone.

Chair Hoy said that bicycle users should know that they could have to wait if the train ran out of space.

Director Menten said she was not aware of a separate bicycle policy and stated that the code of conduct contained relevant provisions.

Mr. Abel noted that the agency issued brochures regarding the use of light rail and other guidelines for bicycle riders.

Director Menten said she wanted to revisit the topic of the GM Oversight committee. She said that previous practice had been to move into executive session, where the General Manager was not present. She asked for clarification that, during the Board Meeting, the Board would have an open discussion regarding the General Manager.

Chair Hoy stated the Board would proceed in that manner barring objections. He said the GM Oversight meetings had been open to the public.

Director Francone said her preference was to keep the Board Meeting open and not to go into executive session unless doing so was necessary. She said Directors should say what they needed to say.

Director Deadwyler stated that some Directors may not want to voice their opinions in a public forum. She said the committee should expect surprises.

Chair Hoy noted that what was said during the GM Oversight committee was public record and said he did not see a difference between Directors speaking at the committee meeting and the Board Meeting. He asked whether Director Deadwyler felt the Board should go into executive session.

Director Deadwyler said she did not think the Board should change policy.

Chair Hoy said he did not think the Board was changing policy.

Director Deadwyler said the Board previously went into executive session without the presence of the General Manager.

Chair Hoy said that the committee directly discussed its findings with the General Manager and asked for the General Manager’s thoughts.

General Manager Genova said that, as he and the GM Oversight committee had discussed, he was agreeable to not having an executive session.

Chair Hoy said he had gotten the sense that the executive session was not necessary.

Director Deadwyler said she felt it inappropriate to consult the General Manager regarding whether to go into executive session.

Director Walker stated that the Board would not be strategizing or negotiating. He asked which statutory citation the Board had used the previous year to validate the use of an executive session.

Ms. McManus responded that the provision regarding personnel matters was used.

Director Walker said the Directors were all public officials who should say what they have to say.

Chair Hoy said it was clear that a majority of the Executive Committee members were opposed to moving into executive session.

Director Menten asked whether the video recordings of the previous two GM Oversight meetings were on the website, and Ms. McManus said they were not. Director Menten then asked whether the Board could provide the audio recordings if someone requested them, and Ms. McManus said that would be possible.

Chair Hoy spoke about open houses and telephone town halls. He said the Public Information (PI) team had begun scheduling open houses and telephone town halls beginning the following week and running through December 2017. He said that, when the available dates, personal schedules, and human resources were considered, along with the fact that the telephone town halls had not been fully procured at that time, he made the decision that the Directors would hold telephone town halls in March 2018. He further stated that the district open houses, as envisioned by the PI team, would be held at the discretion and convenience of each Director. He stated that staff would be approaching the Directors to discuss the preferred dates and locations. He asked whether the Directors were in agreement with him on his decision.

Director Francone asked whether this meant that the PI team would inform the Directors of their participation more than two days prior to the date of the event.

Ms. McManus said that she was working with the PI team on timing and said that the timing of Director Francone’s open house had been a topic of discussion.

Chair Hoy said the issue had been brewing for a while stated that staff would work with the Directors individually to meet their needs.

Director Deadwyler said she had wanted to do away with town halls when staff had dictated the timing, but she stated she was willing to participate as long as she could pick the dates.

Ms. McManus said that outreach meetings would be scheduled in the same manner. She noted that the telephone town halls would take place over a two-week period in March 2018.

Chair Hoy said the telephone town halls would be held mostly in the same way they had been done in the past. He said that he the PI team would send an email to all Directors with available time slots that would be filled on a first-come, first served basis. He said the technological constraints were the reason for this format.

Director Walker said that his open house had already been scheduled and the scheduling had been done much in the same way that Chair Hoy had described it.

Chair Hoy said that the PI team had previously attempted to compress 20 meetings into a two-to-three-week period, but the problem was that there were not enough time slots. As for the open houses, he said that the Directors would have latitude in how they could work with the PI team in order to tailor the presentation to each district. He said that Ms. McManus would help facilitate the outreach process with the PI team. He stated that each Director would be responsible for preparing for their events and inviting constituents and that the PI team would collaborate with the Directors to identify pertinent district issues and construct meetings that would benefit RTD and its constituents.

Ms. McManus added that she was working with the PI team to schedule walking tours for each district starting in the spring of 2018. She said that the Chair had decided that spreading out the three types of outreach meetings over a longer timeline would be more communicative to constituents than doing everything all at once.

Director Menten said she was glad to have in-person town halls and had not been an advocate of telephone town halls. She said that she did not expect staff to help with the town halls but noted she did require assistance with the technological aspects of her recent meeting. She asked whether Roger Sherman of CRL Associates would facilitate the telephone town halls as part of his contract.

Ms. McManus said that the telephone town halls were not in Mr. Sherman’s contract at that time. She said Mr. Sherman would have facilitated the town halls through a different contract if they had been held in 2017, but she noted that the facilitation contract would need to go out for bid in 2018.

Chair Hoy said he enjoyed working with Mr. Sherman because of his knowledge of the agency and that the town halls had not gone as well when a different vendor was used.

Director Menten asked whether the mobile labs were tied to the walking tours.

Ms. McManus said they were separate functions. She said some of the mobile labs would take place on the same date as the open houses. She noted that the open houses and community engagement meetings for Districts I and N were scheduled back to back, which she said was a lot for a single day, but she stated that the structure would be revisited.

Director Francone said that the PI team had done a great job working with her to creating the type of event she had envisioned. She stated that a walking tour did not make sense in her district.

Ms. McManus asked whether Director Francone wanted her community engagement event scheduled for December 13, 2017, and whether she wanted the open house to be scheduled for a future date.

Director Francone said she would be fine with holding both on the same day but said she was struggling with the concept of the walking tour.

Ms. McManus said the structure of the walking tours was still undecided. She said she had a cursory discussion with Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public Information, about the plans for the walking tours, and she said Mr. Currey had engaged in similar efforts in Utah. She noted that walking tours were more feasible in certain districts than others and said that the events should be inclusive.

Director Deadwyler said that Stapleton was the only neighborhood in her district suitable for a walking tour.

Chair Hoy said that any and all outreach was important and that Directors should be involved with guiding the PI team in their districts. He said that Directors would have discretion to decide whether or not to hold walking tours and how they would be structured.

Director Walker reiterated that all of the outreach events were discretionary and that Directors were not obligated to do anything, though he recommended against nonparticipation. He said that the Directors could shape their events to be representative of their districts and that the PI team is interested in Directors’ input on how to structure the events.

Director Menten said she preferred face-to-face interaction with her constituents rather than telephone town halls and preferred speaking to constituents rather than groups of elected officials or other high-level government representatives from her district.

Ms. McManus said that the PI team would work with each Director to select the appropriate audience for the events.

Director Menten said that she felt that she was now in control of her events, whereas previously she had been handed a script.

Chair Hoy noted that the PI team could still want certain questions asked consistently across all districts.

General Manager Genova said he would further discuss plans with the PI team the following week.

Director Walker stated that he was in favor of telephone town halls because not all of his constituents were able to attend meetings.

Director Deadwyler said that she would like to be able to take more calls during telephone town halls because a lot of callers were unable to participate.

Director Menten noted that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) waiver contained some conditional terms. She said the Directors were told that compliance with those term would not be too difficult and asked about the status of that compliance.

General Manager Genova said that the waiver conditions were in relation to at-grade crossing timing, specifically the infrequent occasions when the conventional activation system triggered the gates. He said that positive train control (PTC) accounted for up to 98% of activations. He noted that the FRA had observed the gate timing that week and said the agency would know more following a debriefing on the FRA’s observations.

Director Menten asked whether she could expect an update the following week.

General Manager Genova said he was hopeful staff could present an update the following week.
