BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointment

November 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2025, reappointing Bill Sirois,
Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, and appointing Brenden Morgan, Director, Treasury,
with terms expiring December 31, 2027, to the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DB
plan) and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan) Trusts.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 1, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 8), the RTD Board of Directors
amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust (Trusts,
collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in Resolution
No. 1. Instead, Resolution No. 8 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same Trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

In adopting this Recommended Action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before
January 1, 2008, and a defined contribution retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter.
Each plan is overseen by a Board of Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two RTD Board members
and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving as a permanent Trustee. RTD staff Trustees are
recommended to the RTD Board by the General Manager and CEO for appointment and the RTD Board
Chair, with full RTD Board approval, appoints two RTD Board members as Trustees.
This action item seeks the following for Board approval:
• Extend through December 31, 2027, the term of current Trustee Bill Sirois, Senior Manager,
Transit Oriented Communities, whose term expires on December 31, 2025
• Replace Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer, who is departing RTD in December 2025, with
Brenden Morgan, Director, Treasury, with a term expiring December 31, 2027
Trustees serve staggered terms of two years. The above actions will retain a body of seven Trustees.
The term extension and appointment of these Trustees will focus Trust governance with employees
who participate in and represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise
in the area of finance, as well as maintain Board participation in the salaried employee retirement
Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design
and annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this Recommended Action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Ticket Vending Machines Modernization Title VI Fare
Equity Analysis

November 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the proposed
addition, reduction and replacement strategy for Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs), to comply with
federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Justin Harding, Civil Rights and Equity Analyst
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND

Fare Modernization
RTD continues to advance its fare modernization initiative to improve customer experience, enhance
system reliability and reduce fare collection costs. This includes implementation of tap-to-pay and a
cash digitization retail network, for which the Board approved the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis on
September 30, 2025.
To support modernization goals and optimize TVM utilization, RTD proposes the following changes:
•
•
•
•
•

Reducing TVMs across the system from 185 to 109, including removing all 15 TVMs along the
Flatiron Flyer corridor
Adding two TVMs per platform bidirectionally along the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
corridor for a total of 54
Adding six TVMs in the Denver Union Station Bus Concourse
Adding one TVM at Civic Center Station
Replacing remaining TVMs and adding new TVMs with smaller, cash-capable models

Customers will continue to have access to onboard cash and MyRide payment options.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Circular 4702.1B requires federally funded transit providers to
evaluate proposed fare changes prior to implementation to determine whether they would result in

Packet Pg. 8

1.D.2

disparate impacts (DI) on minority (hereafter referred to as Black, Indigenous and People of Color, or
BIPOC) populations or disproportionate burdens (DB) on low-income populations. On May 28, 2025, the
Board adopted RTD’s 2025-2028 Title VI Program, which clarified the agency’s definition of a fare
change to include modifications to Ticket Vending Machine access, such as changes in the number of
machines, fees or payment options.
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. The policies and their
applicable thresholds are defined as follows:
Disparate Impact Policy: A fare change should not adversely affect BIPOC populations 5% more
than the overall population ridership; this level of impact is considered a disparate
impact. “BIPOC” is defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups
besides white, non-Hispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A fare change should not adversely affect low-income
populations 5% more than the overall population ridership; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
200% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
The purpose of this analysis is to assess whether the proposed fare change would result in DI on BIPOC
populations or DB on low-income populations. When a proposed fare change results in a DI, RTD must
consider alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the impact; demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the change and ensure that no less-discriminatory alternatives exist that would achieve
the same program goals. In cases where a fare change results in a DB on low-income populations, RTD
will consider practicable modifications to mitigate the impact as necessary.
DISCUSSION
Because the proposed TVM changes meet RTD’s Title VI Program definition of a fare change, a Fare
Equity Analysis was required. The complete analysis is provided in Attachment A.
RTD evaluated the proposed changes across four key TVM optimization strategies: 1) TVM reduction, 2)
replacement of remaining TVMs with small-footprint models that match current functionality, 3)
Flatiron Flyer removal and 4) East Colfax BRT placement. Each strategy was assessed for potential DI
on BIPOC populations and DB on low-income populations.
The proposed reduction of TVMs involves removing 61 machines across the system (not including
Flatiron Flyer) while retaining at least one per station. TVM usage is low systemwide, representing 16%
of total fare payments in 2024, with comparable usage among BIPOC and low-income customers. Staff
identified 13 stations that warrant retaining two machines due to higher BIPOC and low-income
demographics, higher cash sales, accessibility needs and/or customer volume.

Packet Pg. 9

1.D.2

The replacement of existing TVMs with smaller models requires careful consideration of fare payment
equity. To ensure equitable access for customers who rely on cash, staff recommend that each smallfootprint TVM be replaced with a cash-capable model. All new or replacement machines must also
meet RTD’s accessibility and language access standards, including support for English and Spanish,
Braille, and audible prompts.

Flatiron Flyer Corridor
For the Flatiron Flyer corridor, RTD proposes removing all 15 TVMs. Utilization is minimal, with fewer
than 2% of customers indicating that they used these machines as their payment method. Along the
corridor stations with TVMs, one of the eight stations (US 36·Sheridan) serves higher-than-average
BIPOC populations, and three (Downtown Boulder, Boulder Junction and US 36·Table Mesa) serve
higher-than-average low-income populations.

East Colfax BRT
The East Colfax BRT corridor has distinct equity considerations. The corridor serves a diverse customer
base, with 63.6% of onboard survey respondents identifying as BIPOC and 60.6% as low-income. Data
from the 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey shows high reliance on cash payment among
customers traveling this corridor. Systemwide, 26.7% of respondents reported paying fares with cash
onboard, compared with 31.4% among BIPOC customers and 33.2% among low-income customers.
Among the 1,240 surveyed customers on Routes 15 and 15L, cash use was higher, with 41.3% of all
respondents, 45.1% of BIPOC and 47.3% of low-income customers using cash payment.
Methodology:
Staff evaluated potential equity impacts of RTD’s TVM modernization plan using multiple data sources
consistent with FTA Title VI Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV-19 guidance. Data sources included the 2024
Onboard Transit Customer Survey, 2019-2023 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates,
2024 station-level boardings and ramp deployments, TVM cash sales data and RTD’s cash digitization
retail network. These sources informed both system-level and station-level analyses and supported the
creation of a composite index to guide decisions on TVM placement and retention.

System-Level
At the system level, the onboard survey provided a representative view of fare payment methods and
customer demographics across RTD’s service area. Survey responses were analyzed by fare payment
method and demographic characteristics, including BIPOC and low-income status, to support systemlevel DI/DB calculations.

Flatiron Flyer Corridor
For the Flatiron Flyer corridor, a separate analysis was conducted. TVM use was limited among
surveyed customers, so a proportional demographic analysis using ACS data was applied. This review
compared the share of BIPOC and low-income populations within a half mile of Flatiron Flyer stations
against the broader service area. The half-mile buffer aligns with standard FTA and Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) practices for capturing populations likely to access stations.

Packet Pg. 10

1.D.2

Station-Level Analysis
At the station level, a weighted composite index score was developed to evaluate potential equity
impacts. Six key metrics were included: BIPOC population, low-income population, customer
boardings, ramp deployments, cash sales and proximity to retailers. Each metric was standardized
using quartile rankings and weighted by its relevance to Title VI considerations: BIPOC (30%), lowincome (20%), boardings (15%), ramp deployments (15%), cash sales (15%) and retailer proximity (5%).
Scores were normalized to a five-point scale to allow comparability across stations.

Accessibility Review
Ramp deployment data were included as a proxy for accessibility needs. Additionally, the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office conducted a desktop review of station renderings to identify potential
concerns related to TVM reductions or relocations, including access to platforms, station entries and
exits, parking and bus loading areas.
Summary of Findings:
Systemwide TVM utilization remains low. Of 18,285 onboard survey respondents, 12,614 answered the
fare payment question. Overall, 9.3% reported using a TVM, with 8.5% of BIPOC customers and 8.6% of
low-income customers using TVMs. Among rail users (4,183 respondents), TVM use is higher: 20.2%
overall, 20.7% of BIPOC customers and 20.0% of low-income customers. These figures do not meet
RTD’s 5% threshold for disparate impact (DI) or disproportionate burden (DB); thus, there is no DI or DB
finding.
At the station level, a composite index score was calculated for each station using demographic,
ridership, accessibility, cash sales and retailer proximity data. Most stations scored between 0 and 3,
indicating low to moderate equity concern. Stations (with numerous existing TVMs) scoring 4 or higher
were prioritized for retaining two TVMs: Lakewood/Wadsworth, Decatur/Federal, Aurora Metro Center,
40th/Colorado and 61st/Peña. The ADA Office’s accessibility review further recommended retaining two
TVMs at Colfax, Peoria, Auraria West, Clear Creek/Federal, I-25/Broadway, Southmoor, Wheat
Ridge/Ward Road and Louisiana/Pearl stations. To maintain equitable access, RTD will retain at least
one TVM per station, retain two at high-priority stations (where two or more currently exist), and
ensure all new or replacement units meet accessibility and language access standards. Maintaining
cash-capable TVMs will address barriers for unbanked or underbanked customers.

Flatiron Flyer Corridor
The 15 TVMs along the Flatiron Flyer corridor are proposed for full removal. Onboard survey results
show very low TVM usage overall (1.9%), with 3.5% of BIPOC customers and 1.8% of low-income
customers using the machines. Only one of the eight stations (US36/Sheridan) serve a higher-thanaverage BIPOC population, and three stations (Downtown Boulder, Boulder Junction, and US36/Table
Mesa) serve a higher-than-average low-income population. Because survey responses were limited, a
proportional analysis using 2019-2023 ACS data was conducted. This analysis showed minimal
differences between BIPOC and non-BIPOC populations (0.39% vs. 0.69%) and a slightly higher impact
on low-income populations versus non-low-income populations (0.90% vs. 0.48%). Cash and MyRide

Packet Pg. 11

1.D.2

payment options are available onboard, mitigating fare access barriers. The composite index score for
these stations averaged 1.5, with none exceeding 2.3, confirming limited equity concern.

East Colfax BRT
For the East Colfax BRT corridor, RTD will install two TVMs per platform. This meets FTA Small Starts
Grant requirements and ensures off-board fare purchase options on one of RTD’s most diverse and
transit-dependent corridors.
Conclusion and Recommendation:
The Title VI Fare Equity Analysis finds that RTD’s proposed TVM modernization strategy does not result
in DI on BIPOC populations or DB on low-income populations.

Systemwide
TVM utilization remains low systemwide. Onboard survey data indicate that usage differences among
all respondents, BIPOC customers and low-income customers do not meet RTD’s 5% thresholds for a
disparate impact or disproportionate burden finding. Localized analysis using the composite index
identified 13 high-priority stations where two TVMs should be retained based on ridership, cash usage
and accessibility needs. Cash-capable, accessible and multilingual machines at these locations ensure
equitable access.

Flatiron Flyer Corridor
TVM usage along the Flatiron Flyer corridor is minimal. Onboard survey data and supplemental ACSbased proportional analysis indicate that the proposed removal of all 15 TVMs will have negligible
impacts on BIPOC and low-income populations. Customers retain onboard cash and MyRide payment
options, mitigating any potential fare access barriers.

East Colfax BRT
For the East Colfax BRT corridor, two TVMs will be installed per platform. Machines will be cashcapable and offer multilingual access, consistent with FTA Small Starts Grant requirements and RTD’s
Title VI commitments. This approach ensures equitable fare access along one of RTD’s most diverse
and transit-dependent corridors.

Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station
RTD intends to develop a closed-system design for the Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. Six TVMs
will be needed to support this design. In addition, RTD staff requested installing one TVM at Civic
Center Station. These objectives will be incorporated into the agency’s overall TVM strategy following
the review and approval of this analysis.
The proposed actions support RTD’s strategic goals of improving customer experience, maintaining
system reliability and efficiently managing fare collection resources. RTD concludes that the proposed
fare change does not result in an inequitable distribution of benefits or burdens. If the Board approves
the Title VI Analysis, the proposed fare change will proceed as proposed.

Fare Equity Analysis: TVM Modernization

1.D.2.a

Executive Summary
RTD conducted a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis to evaluate whether proposed changes to the agency’s
ticket vending machines (TVMs) would result in disparate impacts (DI) on Black, Indigenous and other
People of Color (BIPOC) populations or disproportionate burdens (DB) on low-income populations. The
analysis reviewed proposed modifications to TVMs across the system, including their reduction and
replacement at the system level, full removal along the Flatiron Flyer corridor and addition along the
East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor.

Summary of Findings
System-Level Findings
Analysis of 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey data found that TVM usage among all customers is
low (9.3%), with comparable rates among BIPOC (8.5%) and low-income (8.6%) customers. These
results indicate no DI or DB associated with the proposed system-wide reduction of TVMs. However,
due to nonresponse from nearly one-third of survey participants, staff supplemented survey data with
a station-level analysis to ensure a more complete evaluation.
Station-Level Findings
A composite index score—incorporating demographic, ridership, accessibility and retail access data—
was developed to assess station-level equity implications. Most stations scored low, suggesting limited
concern for equity or accessibility impacts. Thirteen stations with two or more existing TVMs received
higher composite scores (four or greater) or accessibility considerations and were identified for
retaining more than one TVM to maintain equitable access. These stations include
Lakewood●Wadsworth, Decatur●Federal, Aurora Metro Center, 40th●Colorado, 61st●Peña, Colfax,
Peoria, Auraria West, Clear Creek●Federal, I-25●Broadway, Southmoor, Wheat Ridge●Ward Road and
Louisiana●Pearl.
Flatiron Flyer Findings
According to RTD’s 2024 onboard survey results, TVM use along the Flatiron Flyer corridor is extremely
low (1.9% overall, 3.5% among BIPOC, 1.8% among low-income customers). Due to limited survey
responses, proportional analysis using 2019-2023 American Community Survey (ACS) data was
conducted as a supplement. Results showed only marginally more low-income populations may be
impacted than non-low-income populations, which staff deemed negligible (0.48% versus 0.90%,
respectively). Overall, removal of the 15 TVMs along the Flatiron Flyer corridor presents minimal equity
concern.
East Colfax BRT Findings
Findings from the 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey show that cash payment remains an essential
option for many RTD customers, particularly on the Colfax corridor. Systemwide, roughly one in four
customers pays fares with cash, rising to nearly half of customers on Routes 15 and 15L, one of RTD’s
most diverse and transit-dependent corridors. These results highlight the need to maintain both
onboard and off-board cash payment options to ensure equitable fare access as RTD transitions to
modernized payment systems.

Fare Equity Analysis: TVM Modernization

1.D.2.a

Actions
Staff intend to pursue the following:
•

•

•

•

Systemwide TVM reduction. Proceed with reduction of TVMs, ensuring at least one machine
remains at each station (excluding Flatiron Flyer stations). Retain two machines at 13 priority
stations identified through the composite index and accessibility review and keep the lower-level
TVM at Downtown Littleton Station for accessibility purposes.
Replacement with small footprint TVMs. Support replacement if new machines are cashcapable. Machines should meet accessibility standards and include language access in English,
Spanish and all safe harbor languages.
Flatiron Flyer TVM removal. Removal is supported due to redundancy with onboard payment
options and low overall usage. However, the agency may wish to retain high-revenue machines
at Downtown Boulder and US 36●Table Mesa stations or other Flatiron Flyer TVMs for reasons
beyond equity.
East Colfax BRT implementation. Support installation of a cash-capable TVM at each stop
bidirectionally to ensure equitable access to fare media for this diverse ridership base as well as
to meet the requirement of the Small Starts Grant funding the project.

Finally, RTD intends to develop a closed-system design for the Denver Union Station Bus Concourse.
Six TVMs will be needed to support this design. In addition, staff requested adding one TVM at Civic
Center Station. These directives will be incorporated into the agency’s overall TVM modernization
strategy following the review and adoption of this analysis.

Conclusion
Staff find that the proposed TVM strategy does not result in any DI on BIPOC populations or
disproportionate burden on low-income populations. With the described mitigations in place—
particularly ensuring accessibility and station-level retention where warranted—the proposed TVM plan
advances RTD’s fare modernization goals while maintaining equitable access across the system.

Background
RTD is advancing its fare collection strategy to improve customer experience and reduce the cost of
collecting fares. This strategy balances near-term updates with future-oriented planning to meet the
needs of diverse customers while aligning infrastructure and technology decisions with this agency
priority.
A key component of this strategy is the replacement and optimization of TVMs across the RTD system.
In the initial proposal, RTD had outlined plans to replace 185 outdated and non-compliant TVMs and
procure an additional 54 TVMs for the East Colfax BRT line. Early estimates also indicated that the cost
of collecting fares through TVMs is significantly higher than other fare collection methods, costing more
than $0.21 for every dollar received compared with $0.04-$0.09 for alternatives such as mobile ticketing
and onboard fareboxes.1

RTD also offers several fare payment options that can be pre-purchased with cash or credit/debit cards, including paper
ticket books and passes, mobile tickets and MyRide stored value.

Fare Equity Analysis: TVM Modernization

1.D.2.a

As a result, RTD is now proposing four actions to ensure that the procurement of TVMs is aligned with
RTD’s fare collection strategy:
1. Reduce the number of TVMs at existing stations
2. Replace remaining TVMs with smaller footprint TVMs
3. Remove TVMs from Flatiron Flyer stations
4. Optimize the number of TVMs for the East Colfax BRT
Given that the proposed reduction of TVMs constitutes a fare change as defined in RTD’s 2025-2028
Title VI Program, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis must be completed.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Requirements
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in federally funded
programs. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race,
color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) implements this statute through Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and
Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients, which provides guidance on how transit
providers that receive federal funding must comply with Title VI regulations.
Title VI Requirements to Conduct a Fare Equity Analysis
FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.4 requires transit agencies to conduct a Title VI fare equity analysis
whenever fare or major service changes are proposed. The purpose of the analysis is to ensure that
proposed changes do not result in discriminatory impacts, including a DI on BIPOC populations and/or
a DB on low-income populations.2 Considerations in the analysis include whether fare structures place
a higher burden on protected groups than on the overall ridership, whether customers have equitable
access to specialized fare media and whether communication methods adequately reach linguistically
diverse populations.
RTD’s Fare Equity Analysis Policy
In compliance with FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD maintains a fare Disparate Impact Policy
and a Disproportionate Burden Policy within its 2025-2028 Title VI Program. The most recent update
refined the definition of a fare change and retained existing thresholds used to determine whether
proposed changes result in inequitable impacts on BIPOC or low-income populations compared with
overall ridership.
RTD defines a fare change to include:
•
•

Increases or decreases in the price of fare media
Introduction or discontinuation of fare media (e.g., cash, paper pass, or electronic)

2

RTD considers households earning at or below 200% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines
to be low income.

Changes in fare types or products (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass)
Adjustments to fare levels (e.g., Standard, Airport) or customer categories (e.g., full-fare,
seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare recipients, LiVE program participants and youth
ages 19 and under)
Modifications to TVM access, such as changes in quantity, fees or payment options

Access-a-Ride services are excluded from this definition and are not subject to Title VI fare equity
requirements.
Under RTD’s DI and DB policies, a DI is found when a proposed fare change affects BIPOC populations
5% more than the overall ridership, and a DB is found when a change affects low-income populations
5% more than overall ridership. If an analysis identifies a DI or DB, RTD evaluates whether
modifications can avoid, minimize or mitigate the impact. A fare change with a DI may proceed only if
there is a substantial legitimate justification and no less discriminatory alternative can achieve the
agency’s goals. When a DB is identified, RTD will consider adjusting the proposal to mitigate the impact
where practicable.
The following section outlines the initial proposed modifications to the agency’s TVMs.

Initial Proposed Changes
Removal of 89 TVMs at Existing Stations
The proposal recommends reducing the total number of TVMs across the system, ensuring that at least
one TVM remains at each station with existing machines, with the exception of Flatiron Flyer stations
(see below). In total, 893 machines are proposed for removal, including 25 that are credit/debit cardonly.
Replacement of 96 Machines with Small Footprint TVMs
If the agency proceeds with reducing the overall number of TVMs across the system, while maintaining
at least one TVM at each station in each direction of travel where currently applicable, the next
recommendation is to replace the remaining 96 TVMs with models that have a smaller footprint.
Removal of all TVMs at Flatiron Flyer Stations
The final proposed change is to remove all TVMs located at Flatiron Flyer stations. This proposal is
supported by two considerations. First, customers can already purchase fares with cash directly
onboard Flatiron Flyer vehicles or with credit/debit cards using mobile tickets and MyRide stored value
prior to boarding, making the presence of TVMs redundant. Second, the planned launch of tap-to-pay
open payment in the fourth quarter of 2025 will allow customers to purchase fares on board using
contactless credit or debit cards or mobile wallets. This change is expected to render TVMs largely
obsolete, particularly given that in 2024 an average of 71%of fares purchased at TVMs along the
Flatiron Flyer route were paid with credit or debit cards.

1.D.2.a

Optimize the Number of TVMs for East Colfax BRT
To maintain compliance with the Federal Transit Administration’s Small Starts Grant funding for the
East Colfax BRT project, RTD is required to install one TVM at each Colfax BRT stop bidirectionally.
This requirement will support access to off-board fare purchases for all customers.

Methodology
To understand which customers may be impacted by modifications to TVMs throughout the service
area, staff considered several data sources that capture the demographics and travel behavior of
customers:
•
•
•
•
•
•

RTD’s Onboard Transit Customer Survey (2024)
U.S. Census Bureau’s 2019-2023 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates
Average station/stop ramp deployments (January 2024 to January 2025)
Customer boardings (January 2024 to January 2025)
TVM sales data (2024)
RTD retail network (2024)

Onboard data informed the necessary DI/DB calculations for proposed changes at the system level
and, separately, along the Flatiron Flyer route.4 The remaining data informed the creation of a
composite index score, described later in this methodology, to evaluate the impacts of the proposed
changes at the station level. Finally, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office conducted a
desktop accessibility review of station renderings to flag concerns that may arise from removing specific
TVMs.

System-Level, Flatiron Flyer, and East Colfax BRT Analyses
Onboard Transit Customer Survey
From August 19 to December 10, 2024, RTD conducted a systemwide onboard customer survey
providing a snapshot of weekday trip characteristics across 99 bus routes and 10 rail lines with 18,285
customer responses (excluding visitors). The survey resulted in 66% sample of trips for bus and 33%
sample for rail. Data was weighted to the estimated weekday ridership of 170,000 originating rides.
This data informed the system-level analysis to determine if the proposed systemwide reduction of
TVMs would result in a DI or DB, as required by the FTA.
The DI and DB calculations for the proposed full-scale removal of TVMs along the Flatiron Flyer were
conducted separately. However, the 2024 onboard survey data showed that only 1.9% of Flatiron Flyer
customers used TVMs, with very few BIPOC and low-income respondents answering this question in
the survey. Because the sample size was too small to produce statistically valid results, the onboard
4

The Transit Equity Office relied on onboard survey data for these disparate impact and disproportionate burden calculations
because FTA Circular 4702.1B instructs transit providers to analyze ridership-survey information on fare media usage to
identify whether BIPOC or low-income customers use the affected payment methods more heavily. Specifically, Circular
Section IV.7 Data Analysis, “For proposed changes … the transit provider shall analyze any available information generated
from ridership surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income riders are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type, or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.”

data could not reliably inform this portion of the analysis. Instead, a proportional analysis using 20192023 American Community Survey data was conducted to assess potential equity impacts by comparing
the share of BIPOC and low-income residents in census block groups within a half mile of Flatiron Flyer
stations to those across the broader service area.
The onboard survey was also used to inform analysis of TVMs proposed for the East Colfax BRT—
specifically, fare payment methods for customers on the 15/15L, which are the routes most similar to
future East Colfax BRT routing.

Station-Level Analysis
Composite Index Score
Staff wanted to evaluate how proposed changes to TVMs may affect Title VI populations at the station
level in addition to system-level DI/DB calculations. To do so, the team calculated a weighted composite
index score for each station. This score integrates six key metrics:
•

•

•

•

•

Demographic data on race/ethnicity and income. A proportional analysis using 2019-2023
ACS five-year estimates was conducted to evaluate whether removing TVMs would
disproportionately affect BIPOC and/or low-income populations. Demographic data was mapped
to census block groups within a half-mile radius of each station.
Customer volume (i.e., average boardings). Customer boarding volumes from 2024
provide essential context for understanding overall station activity. Evaluating boardings helps
determine where TVMs are most needed to support fare purchases and maintain equitable
access to cash payment options. High ridership locations may warrant retaining additional TVMs
to prevent undue barriers for customers.
Average ramp deployments. Because ramp usage reflects how frequently customers require
mobility assistance or devices board at each location, the inclusion of average ramp deployment
data (2024) ensures that accessibility is considered in evaluating TVM removals.
Cash sales. Station-level sales data from 2024 helps identify where customers are most reliant
on TVMs. Because BIPOC and low-income customers are more likely to be unbanked or prefer
cash payments, this data offers a more accurate picture of how TVM removals may affect equity
populations.
Proximity of nearby retailers. Approximately 130 King Soopers and Safeway stores across
the metro area sell RTD fare media, including ticket books and monthly passes. The number of
retailers within a half-mile radius around each station were calculated and, in effect, act as a
mitigating factor in the case of a proposed TVM removal and/or replacement.

Each of the six metrics was converted to a standardized score using quartile ranking, where stations in
the lowest quartile received a score of 0 and those in the highest quartile received a score of 3. Specific
scoring logic varied slightly by metric; for example, stations with fewer nearby retailers or higher ramp
deployments received higher scores to indicate greater potential equity concern.
Once individual metric scores were established, staff applied weights to reflect each factor’s relative
importance to Title VI equity considerations. For station-level analysis, weights were assigned as
follows:

•

BIPOC population – 30%
Low-income population – 20%
Boardings – 15%
Ramp deployments – 15%
Cash sales – 15%
Retailers – 5%

Each station’s overall score was calculated using the equation:
Station Score = (BIPOC population x 0.30) + (Low-income population x 0.20) + (Boardings x 0.15) +
(Ramp deployments x 0.15) + (Cash sales x 0.15) + (Retailers x 0.05)
Scores were then normalized to a five-point scale by multiplying by 5/3. Higher scores indicate stations
with greater equity and/or accessibility considerations.
Accessibility Desktop Review
After staff calculated the DI/DB and composite index scores, the ADA Office examined renderings of
all rail stations and assessed the position of TVMs in relation to rail platforms, accessible parking
facilities, station entry and exit points, and, where applicable, bus loading platforms. This review
identified the TVM locations that offer the most accessible opportunities for customers to purchase fare
and allowed the ADA Office to determine whether a TVM removal would cause an undue burden for
people with disabilities.

Results
System-Level Analysis

The first proposal includes an overall reduction in the number of TVMs across the system, where one
TVM would remain at all stations with existing TVMs (except those at Flatiron Flyer stations; see below).
Specifically, 895 were initially recommended for removal, with 25 of those being credit card-only
machines.
To conduct the required DI/DB analysis per the FTA, staff used ridership data collected via the 2024
Onboard Transit Customer Survey. After processing the survey responses, staff found that
approximately 10,092 of 18,285 completed surveys (55%) identified as BIPOC, and 8,800 of 14,359
completed surveys (63%) identified as low-income, using 200% of the federal poverty level as the
threshold.
Respondents were asked, “What fare payment method did you use?”—a question that served as a data
source for this analysis. However, this measure has limitations. Of the 18,285 non-visiting customers
who completed the survey, only 12,614 (69%) responded to the fare payment question. Among those
who did, 9.3% reported using a TVM. TVM usage rates were similar across all respondent groups—
8.5% among BIPOC respondents and 8.6% among low-income respondents—indicating no meaningful
variation by demographic (and no DI or DB finding). These results also indicate that TVM usage is

generally low. When isolating rail customers, usage is higher: 20.2% used TVMs for fare payment, with
BIPOC customers at 20.7% and low-income customers at 20% (no DI or DB finding).

Figure 1. Percentage of Respondents Who Reported Using TVMs as Fare Payment Method (2024)

Because nearly one-third of respondents did not answer the fare payment question, the
representativeness of this data is limited. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution;
the station-level analysis that follows, including an accessibility review, helps ensure a more complete
equity assessment.

Station-Level Analysis
To further inform the impact of TVM removal, staff calculated a weighted composite index score for
each station as described in the methodology. Stations receiving lower scores posed the least equity
concern for TVM removal, and those receiving higher scores pose the most equity concern for TVM
removal. Staff designated stations with a score of four or higher as those that may warrant keeping a
second TVM (where multiple TVMs already exist). Additionally, the ADA Office examined renderings
of each station to determine whether a specific TVM’s removal would inhibit accessibility for people
with disabilities.

Staff identified five stations (with two or more existing TVMs) that received a composite score of four
or above: Lakewood●Wadsworth, Decatur●Federal, Aurora Metro Center, 40th●Colorado and

RTD should retain additional TVMs at eight additional stations: Colfax, Peoria, Auraria West, Clear
Creek●Federal, I-25●Broadway, Southmoor, Wheat Ridge●Ward Road and Louisiana●Pearl.

Flatiron Flyer Analysis
The final proposal is to remove all 15 TVMs at Flatiron Flyer stations. Two reasons are given: first,
that customers can purchase fares with cash and MyRide (mobile tickets and stored value) on board
Flatiron Flyers already, making TVMs redundant; and second, that RTD will launch tap-to-pay open
payment in the fourth quarter of 2025, leaving TVMs largely obsolete for bus customers since they
will be able to purchase tickets on board with credit/debit cards (especially given that in 2024, an
average of 71% of fares purchased across TVMs along the Flatiron Flyer route were paid for by
credit/debit card).
The proposed removal suggests minimal impact on BIPOC and low-income populations, as only one
of the eight (US 36●Sheridan) Flatiron Flyer stops is considered a BIPOC stop, and three of the eight
(Downtown Boulder, US 36●Table Mesa) are considered low-income stops.8

Further, onboard survey data show TVM use along the Flatiron Flyer is low overall (1.9% of customers
selected it as their fare payment method). Among BIPOC customers, use was 3.5%, and among lowincome customers, 1.8%. Both of these results are within the 5% DI and DB thresholds. However,
these figures are too small to be statistically reliable given that only 57 BIPOC and 55 low-income
respondents answered this portion of the survey. A supplemental proportional analysis using ACS
population-based data found that removing TVMs would have less impact on BIPOC populations
compared with non-BIPOC populations (0.39% vs. 0.69%). On the other hand, there is a slightly
higher impact on low-income populations compared with non-low-income populations (0.90% vs.
0.48%). The difference is extremely small, and staff consider equity impacts to be negligible.
The composite index score reinforces that there is limited concern; the average score received by the
Flatiron Flyer stops was 1.5, and none exceeded 2.3 on the five-point scale.

East Colfax BRT Analysis
Data from the 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey indicated that, systemwide, 26.7% of
respondents reported paying fares with cash onboard, compared with 31.4% among BIPOC customers
and 33.2% among low-income customers. Analysis of the 1,240 responses from customers on Routes
15 and 15L10 showed even higher reliance on cash: 41.3% of all respondents, 45.1% of BIPOC and
47.3% of low-income customers reported using cash payment. Additionally, Routes 15 and 15L operate
along one of RTD’s most diverse ridership corridors, where 63.6% of 15/15L onboard survey
respondents indicated that they were BIPOC and 60.6% low-income (respectively 7.6% and 8.6%
higher than the onboard survey average). These findings underscore the continued importance of
maintaining both onboard and off-board cash payment options until access to and adoption of other
payment methods become more widespread.

Actions
Based on this analysis, RTD staff intend to take the following actions to ensure its future TVM
modernization strategy centers equity and accessibility.
Reduction of TVMs at Existing Stations
Equity impacts from the proposed TVM reduction are predicted to be minimal. Concerns are also
assuaged by the fact that since 2024:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Approximately 90% of all transactions were by card, and RTD will implement a tap-to-pay
system in the fourth quarter of 2025
More than two-thirds of all transactions took place at two stations (Denver Airport Station and
Denver Union Station)
At several stations, the majority of fares are collected at a minority of TVMs (e.g., use among
TVMs at stations is not evenly distributed)
Nearly all stations have seen reduced TVM use since 2021
In 2024, total sales on TVMs proposed for removal at stations in BIPOC census block groups
are almost 50% less than those in non-BIPOC census block groups
In 2024, total sales on TVMs proposed for removal at stations in low-income census block
groups are only slightly higher (8.8%) than those in non-low-income census block groups

As a result, staff support systemwide reduction of TVMs, provided each station (excluding Flatiron Flyer
stations) retains at least one, and 13 higher-priority stations should retain two TVMs based on equity
and accessibility metrics. Specifically, staff propose that stations with numerous existing TVMs receiving
a composite index score of four and above retain two TVMs. This includes Lakewood●Wadsworth,
Decatur●Federal, Aurora Metro Center, 40th●Colorado and 61st●Peña Stations. In addition, the
accessibility review reiterates the need for two TVMs at Lakewood●Wadsworth Station and indicates
that RTD should retain additional TVMs at Colfax, Peoria, Auraria West, Clear Creek●Federal, I25●Broadway, Southmoor, Wheat Ridge●Ward Road and Louisiana●Pearl stations. The accessibility
review also specified that any TVM removed at Downtown Littleton Station should be the upper TVM,
10

The 15/15L onboard survey is used for comparison given its similarity to the upcoming Colfax BRT routing.

since the lower TVM would better maintain station accessibility (see below for more information on
TVM replacement).
In sum, the total number of TVMs removed would drop from 74 to 61 (excluding the 15 Flatiron Flyer
stops).
Replacement of Machines with Small Footprint TVMs
Staff support replacement of remaining TVMs with small footprint TVMs if RTD procures models that
accept and dispense cash, given that BIPOC and low-income populations are more likely to be
unbanked and reliant on cash.11 Staff discourage the agency from adopting a change-free or changelimited TVM network.
RTD must also ensure that smaller footprint TVMs meet language access and accessibility needs by
providing digital translations in RTD’s top safe harbor languages, displaying instructions in English and
Spanish and offering Braille and audible guidance where applicable.
Removal of all TVMs at Flatiron Flyer Stations
Staff do not foresee equity impacts from removing the 15 TVMs at Flatiron Flyer stations, especially
given their redundancy with customer ability to pay via cash or card on board the Flatiron Flyers
themselves. Nevertheless, there may be other reasons to keep TVMs at Flatiron Flyer stations. For
example, TVMs at Downtown Boulder and US 36●Table Mesa stations netted over $93,000 and
$140,000 in 2024 sales, respectively. This level of sales could indicate a need to keep these machines.
Further, with East Colfax BRT and Federal BRT slated to receive TVMs, it may make sense to keep
TVMs along the Flatiron Flyer. In other words, the decision may hinge on revenue or other
considerations rather than equity. Staff leave this decision-making to other agency staff.
Optimize the Number of TVMs for East Colfax BRT
In compliance with the FTA Small Starts Grant funding for the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
project, staff support the addition of a cash-capable TVM at each East Colfax BRT stop, bidirectionally.
This will, in turn, enable access to off-board fare purchases for all RTD customers and support one of
RTD’s most diverse and cash-reliant population segments.
Place New TVMs at Denver Union Station Bus Concourse and Civic Center Station
RTD intends to develop a closed-system design for the Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. Six TVMs
will be needed to support this design. In addition, RTD staff requested installing one TVM at Civic
Center Station. These directives will be incorporated into the agency’s overall TVM strategy following
the review and adoption of this analysis.

1.D.2.a

Public Engagement
RTD will implement a coordinated outreach approach to inform customers about the reduction and
replacement of TVMs. The focus will be on transparency and accessibility, ensuring customers
understand what changes are coming and when they will occur. The Transit Equity Office and
Communications and Engagement Department will work together to ensure that customers, particularly
those who rely on cash or station-based fare payment, are aware of the planned changes and available
alternatives.
The outreach strategy will explore several approaches to reach customers effectively. Staff will look
into deploying contractors and staff to rail stations to provide direct information, answer questions and
distribute materials. The Marketing Department will explore producing decals and informational signage
at stations and onboard rail vehicles to notify customers of upcoming changes. The team will consider
developing printed materials such as rack cards or flyers summarizing the TVM reduction and
replacement process, including available payment options and project timelines. RTD will also explore
creating a dedicated webpage that outlines TVM updates, replacement schedules and fare payment
options such as MyRide and retail network cash-loading locations.
Additional communication tactics will include bilingual Read-n-Ride articles, social media updates and
news releases to ensure broad awareness. The Transit Equity Office will continue multilingual
engagement at community events to share information directly with customers, particularly BIPOC,
low-income and unbanked populations who may be more impacted by cash-related changes.
Through these combined efforts, RTD aims to provide clear, timely and equitable information about
the TVM reduction and replacement project across multiple communication channels. Because the work
is not slated to begin until 2026, the outreach approach may be modified as the project progresses.

Conclusion
RTD’s analysis concludes that the proposed TVM modernization plan maintains equitable fare access
across the system. Systemwide usage of TVMs remains low, with no evidence of DI on BIPOC customers
or DB on low-income customers. A station-level review identified 13 locations for retaining two
machines to ensure accessibility and service equity. The proposed removal of all Flatiron Flyer TVMs
presents minimal equity concern, as customers have onboard cash and MyRide payment options. For
the East Colfax BRT corridor, installing cash-capable TVMs at all stops will uphold Title VI and FTA
Small Starts requirements while supporting a diverse and transit-dependent customer base. Overall,
the proposed mitigations, including cash-capable machines and targeted station retention, align with
RTD’s fare modernization goals and Title VI equity standards.

November 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution __ Series of 2025 which commits the Board and staff to
certain exploratory and planning efforts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
REPRESENTATIVES
Michael Guzman, Chair of the Finance and Planning Committee and Director (District C)
Karen Benker, Vice Chair of the Finance and Planning Committee and Director (District I)
Julien Bouquet, Board Chair and Director (District G)
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year the Board of Directors must adopt an annual budget and enact the associated resolution(s)
appropriating funds. The development and execution of the annual budget is guided by the Board’s
Fiscal Policy. The planning and preparation process for the annual budget is complex and extensive,
beginning many months before the Board is provided with a draft budget for review.
Because the Board is tasked with final approval of the budget, the budget is a reflection of the Board’s
priorities. However, under current practices which are driven by the complexities of the budget
development process and the Board’s Fiscal Policy, the Board does not review a draft budget until
October of each year. This timing creates procedural barriers in ensuring the annual budget
incorporates the priorities of the Board.
Given the challenges the Board faces ensuring its priorities are incorporated into the budget in the
limited time frame from when a draft budget is produced to when a final budget must be passed, the
Board must start its efforts early each year to ensure staff has appropriate direction from the Board in
the development of the proposed and final budgets.
DISCUSSION
The above Directors have identified certain planning efforts, commitments and areas of inquiry the
Board and staff should jointly pursue during fiscal years 2026 and 2027. These commitments will help

Packet Pg. 53

facilitate a budget development process which can more readily incorporate Board priorities. Directors
are asked to review, discuss, and vote on the attached resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The resolution calls for an increase in the available funds for the Partnership Program’s 2026 Call for
Projects for a maximum of $10 million in 2027 to fund existing and newly awarded projects. to be paid

Board of Directors and made it available for public review by October 15, 2025, as required by §29-1106, Colorado Revised Statutes, providing a transparent appropriation process allowing for Board and
public input and comment. The 2026 Proposed Budget was made available in hardcopy form in the
Board Office and was posted on the RTD website with public notice posted in the Denver Post and
Boulder Daily Camera newspapers.
The 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF), was presented to the Finance and Planning
Committee on September 9, 2025, as an action item and informed the development of the 2026
Proposed Budget.
This 2026 Proposed Budget action item includes a description of changes since the 2026 Proposed
Budget Finance and Planning Committee discussion item on October 14, 2025, and since the 2026
Proposed Budget study session on October 22, 2025.
DISCUSSION
The attached 2026 Proposed Budget document includes narratives describing the financial assumptions
and alignment with RTD’s Board-adopted Strategic Plan. In addition, tables, charts and commentary are

Staff have developed the 2026 Proposed Budget to conform with RTD’s Fiscal Policy directives while
best meeting the transit needs of its customers and communities at large.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

maintaining 2026 Fiscal Policy requirements. RTD’s internal controls and budget appropriation process
provide those charged with leadership and governance responsibilities with the opportunity to adjust
and realign appropriations, within their delegated authority, throughout the fiscal year as necessary.

Reduced Capital • Room for More Operating Expense
§ Capital and Operating budgets serve different purposes
• Capital Expenditures (CapEx): One-time investments in long-lived assets (vehicles, facilities, etc.)
• Operating Expenditures (OpEx): Recurring costs to run the organization (wages, fuel, maintenance, etc.)
• These budgets are governed by different funding sources, accounting treatments, and sustainability
horizons

§ Lower CapEx does not increase spendable income
• Debt service and prior capital obligations remain fixed even if new projects are deferred
• Net revenue coverage ratios measure ability to meet debt service, not total spending
• Unbalanced budgets leave no capacity to reallocate spending toward recurring operations

General Manager and CEO Message

Debra A. Johnson

General Manager and CEO
• As RTD’s Transit Police Department continues to grow, the addition
of sworn officers better enables RTD-PD to build connections
and respond to calls throughout the agency’s service area. The
department has expanded its unhoused outreach coordinators and
added mental health clinicians, an approach pioneered in transit
policing by the Chief of Police and Emergency Management.
I extend my gratitude to each one of RTD’s employees, whose
commitment and dedication have made these gains possible. They
bring their best selves to work every day in public service and make
a meaningful difference in the health of the region. I acknowledge
the contributions of the agency’s Board of Directors and its labor
and contract partners. I also thank every customer, stakeholder, local
leader, and partner who engaged with RTD. The agency will continue
to be agile and flexible as it endeavors to meet the transit needs of
the individuals and communities within its service district.

FT

The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget encapsulates RTD’s financial plan for the
forthcoming year. This budget aligns with the agency’s 2021–2026
Strategic Plan, which outlines an ongoing commitment to the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success. With this commitment also comes
a continued emphasis on the strategic initiative of Customer and
Community Connections, alongside the newly introduced initiatives of
Enhancing Public Trust, Building a Better RTD, and Service Excellence.

A

This budget reflects an intentional focus on the four initiatives which
are interwoven into work plans across all agency departments and
divisions. RTD will continue to make meaningful progress toward
established success outcomes by centering its work on each of these
factors. While RTD’s Finance staff, Leadership Team, and subjectmatter experts provide overarching guidance, every employee carries
a responsibility and an opportunity to work in a manner that brings
about meaningful improvements.

D
R

RTD saw substantial milestones and successes in 2025 that were
the direct result of continued coordination by teams and individuals
throughout the agency. Both within and outside RTD, people took
note of the following achievements:

• Following the announcement in March 2022 of a robust plan and
timeline to “Reclaim Union Station,” a collaborative and multi-faceted
strategy aimed at enhancing safety and security at this multimodal
transit hub, RTD in April 2025 reported a nearly 60 percent
reduction in security-related calls and a three-year decrease in
reports of criminal activities at this location.
• Thanks to the diligence and care shown by nearly 100 RTD staff,
from rail laborers to track maintainers, in May the agency lifted the
last of 31 light rail speed restrictions that were put in place over the
prior year as RTD implemented more rigorous standards for regularly
inspecting its more than 120 miles of light rail track. During this
period, crews removed and replaced more than two miles of track
along the D, E, H, and R lines.
• RTD’s most recent annual customer and community surveys, the
results of which were announced in June, showed double-digit,
year-over-year improvements in perceptions of personal safety and
security, the cleanliness of buses and trains, on-time performance,
the frequency of service, and the agency’s overall value in the
Denver metro area.

More specifically, I express my sincere gratitude for CFO Kelly Mackey
who rolled up her sleeves upon her arrival to the organization in May
and has delved into the agency’s inner workings. Additionally, a big
thanks to Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager of Budget; Brenden Morgan,
Senior Manager of Debt and Investment; Heidi Wagner; Senior
Manager of Finance; and all of their respective teams for leaning in
and supporting this critical undertaking in these unpredictable times.
Lastly, my wholehearted appreciation to the Leadership Team who
served as thought partners while I grappled with difficult decisions
to ensure a balanced budget while retaining the agency’s power and
service levels.
RTD is comprised of people moving people and each of these
individuals makes lives better through connections. On behalf of this
entire team, I invite you to keep watching as we make our transit
system one that is better for all.
Sincerely,
Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

• In September, RTD began the next phase of its Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project, which is rebuilding the agency’s oldest rail
infrastructure along its original light rail alignment. This work follows
a successful initial phase in 2024 that was completed weeks ahead
of schedule.

Over the last year, the Regional Transportation District continued
its efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair, addressed
impediments to employee recruitment and retention efforts,
demonstrated its commitment to building customer and community
connections, and made notable gains in creating a welcoming
transit environment for employees and customers alike.

Agency Overview

RTD was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to develop, operate, and
maintain a mass transportation system that
now benefits more than 3.1 million people in
the Denver metro area. With a service area
of 2,345 square miles, RTD provides bus, rail,
and paratransit services in all or part of eight
counties and more than 40 municipalities.
The agency’s services are delivered via 126
bus routes, six light rail lines, four commuter
rail lines, and paratransit mobility options.

RTD is headquartered in Denver and governed
by a publicly elected Board of Directors. Each of
the 15 Directors represent a geographic district
of approximately 200,000 constituents and
serve four-year terms.

Highlights and Accomplishments

Next Phase of Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project Begins
In September, RTD launched the next phase of its multi-year Downtown
Rail Reconstruction Project. The $152 million dollar project, which began
in 2024, is focused on fully reconstructing the light rail track infrastructure
that serves the Downtown Loop, Welton Street Corridor, and runs along
Colfax Avenue. In 2025, crews focused their efforts on reconstructing the
Kalamath Street crossing, which was originally constructed more than 30
years ago.

Final Speed Restrictions Lifted
In May, RTD lifted the last of 31 light rail speed restrictions put into place
a year earlier on D, E, H, and R light rail lines. The temporary speed
restrictions were implemented after the agency adopted more rigorous
standards for inspecting its more than 120 miles of light rail track. RTD
staff worked in three shifts to safely complete the repairs and resume
normal rail service. During the first nine months alone, more than 50 miles
of rail underwent grinding to remove surface defects, reducing the risk of
cracks forming in the future. Crews also installed joint bars and leveled
the ballast that provides stability and supports the light rail tracks. In total,
RTD replaced, lined, tamped, and surfaced more rail during this oneyear period than all similar work completed during the previous 20 years
combined. As sections of track were repaired, slow zones were reduced
and speed restrictions lifted.
Tens of Thousands of Service Hours Restored
RTD’s service changes, which occur approximately three times each year,
aim to enhance the overall transit experience by improving reliability and
on-time performance of bus and rail services. In 2025, RTD added tens of
thousands of in-service hours as compared with 2024, with more buses
and trains running, longer hours of operation, and more frequent service.
This fact was made possible through continued and substantial progress
made in hiring frontline positions. The additional services represent
a significant investment in more accessible public transportation for
customers within RTD’s service area.

Hundreds of Bus Operators Recognized in 5280 Safe Driving Program
RTD in 2025 recognized 436 bus operators who maintained accidentfree driving and avoided preventable incidents in 2024 as part of its
5280 Safe Driving Program. Twelve of the operators honored with this
recognition maintained an accident-free driving record for at least 20
years. Sixty drove over 100,000 miles last year, and 188 maintained
accident-free records for five consecutive years. RTD launched the 5280
Program in 2021 to commend its operators for keeping transit safe for
customers who rely on RTD services to make connections. Mebrahtu
Tsegaye, a bus operator with RTD for 24 years, said, “The key to a
longstanding safe driving record is to “put yourself in the passenger’s
shoes and be patient and respectful.”

Rebuilding the Frontline Workforce
As RTD gradually restored service levels following major reductions
during the initial stages of the pandemic, the agency once again faced
staffing challenges precipitated by bus and rail operator retirements
and separations. A data-driven Human Resources strategy has focused
on strengthening recruitment and retention, particularly for bus and
rail operators. Key initiatives that are helping RTD rebuild its frontline
workforce include expanding the HR team with dedicated talent
acquisition staff, introducing quarterly workforce reporting, and partnering
with operations staff to support new hires. Other areas include improving
operator training, improving compensation with bonuses and overtime
pay, and revamping management training to boost retention.
Introduction of OneRTD Operator Graduation
In 2025, RTD launched an all-new operator graduation ceremony to
recognize Light Rail, Commuter Rail, and Bus Operations employees
who had completed their training. In what is now known as the OneRTD
Operator Graduation, graduates are individually recognized during a
ceremony that is open to friends and family. The monthly graduation
events are also streamed lived on YouTube, shared agency wide in
employee-facing publications, and posted to RTD’s website and social
media platforms.

Continued Growth of Transit Police Department
RTD-PD continued its two-year momentum in building the agency’s police
force as part of its Welcoming Transit Environment strategic initiative. Led
by Chief of Police and Emergency Management Steve Martingano, the
department implemented a four-step action plan in 2025 that focuses on
visibility, customer education, fare enforcement, and technology. Since
August 2019, when RTD-PD had just 19 POST-certified officers, Transit
Police has grown to include 100 sworn officers, alongside a complement
of contracted security personnel. The addition of officers enables RTDPD to increase round-the-clock patrols throughout the district, build
relationships within geographic sectors, take a proactive approach
to policing efforts, and provide a regular presence on vehicles and
properties across the agency’s service area.

CPTED Delivers Results at Denver Union Station
RTD’s commitment to employing Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design (CPTED) decreased security-related calls by
nearly 60% at Denver Union Station in 2025. The agency’s three-year
focus to “Reclaim Union Station” began in March 2022 as a collaborative
and multi-faceted strategy aimed to enhance safety and security at
the multimodal transit hub. Efforts were conducted in partnership with
the City and County of Denver, Denver Police Department, Downtown
Denver Partnership, Sage Hospitality, Lower Downtown Neighborhood
Association, several local businesses, and downtown Denver residents.
In addition to increased patrols, RTD made noticeable enhancements
to its underground bus concourse, rail platforms, and open spaces.
Improvements included better lighting, adding TV monitors to display
security feeds, installing smoke detectors, and placing directional signage
to aid movement within the space.
Substantial Increase in Fare Checks
RTD-PD increased its fare checks by more than 500% since May
2024, with a specific focus on ensuring that individuals on light rail
and commuter rail trains are customers who have paid fare to board.
The growth of the Transit Police Department has allowed for increased
patrolling across RTD’s stops, stations, and vehicles. As of August 2025,
officers were conducting nearly 500,000 individual fare checks a month
on the rail system. The tactic is one part in the four-step security plan
resulting from an in-depth review in 2024 that led Transit Police to ramp
up fare enforcement in support of customers and employees.

Expansion of Customer Experience Elevator Program
After a successful 90-day pilot that began in March 2024, RTD expanded
its Customer Experience Elevator Program, in which elevator doors are
reprogrammed to remain at rest in the open position. The program, which
was extended to nine light rail stations in 2025, has been found to deter
criminal or unwanted activities inside the elevators. Transit Police led
the initiative as part of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
(CPTED) efforts across the entire system. Key findings include a notable,
year-over-year reduction in calls for service. The program’s early success
spurred another transit agency, LA Metro, to implement similar efforts.

Illicit Drug Activity Reports Decreased for 14 Months
RTD has reported 14 consecutive months of year-over-year decreases in
illicit drug activity. On average, such reports were down 65% each month
in 2025 as compared with the same period in 2024. June also marked
the first time in more than three years that illicit drug activity was not the
most frequently reported type of incident by customers, and that trend
has continued. As of September, RTD recorded year-over-year declines in
security-related calls for service every month in 2025.

environment for customers and employees, RTD launched two safetyand security-related webpages that provide a transparent look at the
agency’s efforts. The Personal Safety and Security webpage, which is
available at rtd-denver.com/yoursafety, details RTD’s approach to growing
RTD-PD, providing 24/7 patrolling and using a sector-based approach to
efficiently deploy resources as needed to address concerns.
A new Security-Related Metrics webpage shares a transparent look at
dozens of metrics that the community can view anytime, with securityrelated data updated monthly. The webpage details the number of
security-related calls for service received by RTD-PD, system wide
boardings, the number of security-related calls for service per customer
boardings, Transit Watch app incident reports, arrests, fare checks,
and more.

district. With this capability, RTD will be able to directly investigate thefts
and other criminal activities that occur on its properties. The agency is
also finalizing the establishment of its own evidence room to support
investigative work.

RTD-PD, BNSF Railway Police Establish Working Partnership
Building upon an informal relationship in place for years, RTD announced
in January that the Transit Police Department had entered a formal
working partnership with BNSF Railway Police, enabling RTD’s officers to
access BNSF property to enforce grade crossing and trespassing laws
through arrest, citation, or other lawful means. The letter of authorization
provides a framework for both entities to share information, gain access
to properties, and respond to incidents. BNSF, one of the largest railroad
networks in North America, has a police department that includes
five officers in Colorado, three of whom are in Denver. RTD’s police
department is growing. Cooperation between the two enables greater
police response.

Board Approves Renaming Civic Center Station
After Disability Rights Activist
The formal renaming of this important RTD property as Wade Blank
Civic Center Station honors the late reverend and co-founder of
Atlantis Community Inc., a Denver-based nonprofit that has supported
independent living for people with disabilities for 50 years. Blank played
a prominent role in organizing the historic Gang of 19 protest in 1978,
when 19 disability activists blocked RTD buses at the intersection of
Colfax Avenue and Broadway to demand accessible transit. The protest,
held steps from Civic Center Station, was pivotal in RTD’s decision
to outfit buses with wheelchair lifts, an early milestone in Denver’s
accessible public transportation efforts. Blank’s advocacy and leadership
provided a basis for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which
codified protections against disability-based discrimination across the
United States. The Board’s decision is the culmination of a yearlong
process initiated under RTD’s Honorary Property and Station Naming

accessible transit to thousands of customers who travel daily on one of
Denver’s busiest corridors. The City and County of Denver is leading the
project, estimated at $280 million, with RTD serving as the Federal Transit
Administration’s project sponsor. Traffic patterns along the corridor will
shift to accommodate center-lane service. In Denver’s segment, the two
center lanes of Colfax Avenue will be dedicated exclusively to BRT, with
a dedicated travel lane in each direction. By implementing these shifts

These changes enhance service throughout Boulder County, improve
reliability and connectivity in and around the city’s major transit hubs, and
are intended to accommodate anticipated demand for transit services,
including future Bus Rapid Transit service on State Highway 119.
Helping Customers Navigate Service Disruptions
Routine maintenance and unplanned service disruptions are an inherent
part of transit service. To better assist customers, Impact Teams of
employee volunteers from across the agency were deployed to
affected stations and stops to provide information, answer questions,
and direct individuals to bus shuttles. Team members were also
present at large events, such as the Colorado Rockies home opener,
to help with wayfinding and educate the public about how to use RTD

for responding to social media messages and sending Service Alerts,
expanded its hours of operation to now be 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays,
and the team is also available from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and
certain holidays when RTD services are running on a regular schedule.
This schedule change, which mirrors the Telephone Information Center’s
hours, provides better coverage to respond to customer comments
submitted through the RTD website, and it improves the consistency and
timeliness of Service Alerts disseminated to customers. With the addition
of Saturday hours, the digital team will be more accessible for questions
and concerns that may arise outside regular business hours.

Highlights and Accomplishments

FT

Increase in Youth-Related Outreach Activities
With funding from Senate Bill 24-032, RTD hired a contracted, full-time
Youth Engagement Specialist in December 2024 to raise awareness of
RTD’s Zero Fare for Youth program, which the Board of Directors made
permanent in July 2024, and amplify the agency’s efforts to connect
with children, families, and young adults. As of September, RTD hosted
or attended at least 60 events related to Zero Fare for Youth, attended
six Storytime events with local libraries, and hosted families on L Line
trains at two Storytime on the Train events. Additionally, RTD attended
new student orientations at two colleges and back-to-school events
at local schools. These efforts have helped contribute to an increased
percentage of youth boardings on RTD buses and trains.

RTD Gives School Supply Drive
After a successful collaboration with A Precious Child in 2024, RTD
partnered again with the Broomfield nonprofit to launch a school
supply drive benefiting children and families served by the nonprofit
organization. During the summer months, RTD employees and customers
were encouraged to donate new backpacks, binders, pencils, notebooks,
crayons, and other essentials. As a result of the drive, RTD contributed
over $1,600 in financial donations and collected over 600 pounds of
school supplies.
RTD EcoPass Sales Rise as Customers Resume Taking Transit to Work
RTD’s EcoPass, which offers unlimited rides on the agency’s fixed-route
services, is seeing program participation approach 75% of its prepandemic level. Prior to 2020, over 800 organizations participated in
RTD’s EcoPass program. Although the agency experienced a significant
drop in participation during the pandemic, more companies have been
enrolling in the program in recent years to provide employees with this
benefit. In 2023, 491 employers offered the pass. That number grew to
546 in 2024, and as of July 2025, almost 600 employers are providing
EcoPasses. In recent customer and community survey results, RTD
customers reported “getting to work” as the No. 1 reason for using the
agency’s transit services.

Revenue
RTD’s 2026 revenue budget is expected to decrease
$73 million or 5% to $1,279 million in the forthcoming
year in comparison to the 2025 Adopted Budget.
RTD conservatively budgets projected revenues
in accordance with its Fiscal Policy to plan for
revenue that is reasonably certain to be collected.
Fare revenue, grant revenue, and other income are
based on projections from the 2026-2030 FiveYear Financial Forecast (FYFF), utilizing modest
assumptions in ridership growth, actual grant
apportionment information, and baseline assumptions
for other revenue, including advertising, investment,
and miscellaneous sources.

Operating Expenses
The 2026 operating expense budget of $1,113
million is expected to decline $120 million from the
2025 Adopted Budget. The Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) with the Amalgamated Transit
Union (ATU) Local 1001 final rate increases have been
included in the 2026 Proposed Budget. Insurance
expense is expected to increase 9% to $18 million in
2026. 2024 and 2025 included step payments in the
Concessionaire Agreement that do not continue in
2026, resulting in $45 million savings.

A

FT

Sales and use tax revenue of $877 million, which
comprises 69% of RTD’s expected funding sources in
2026, is derived from the September 2025 forecast
provided by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business; it anticipates decline of 2.9% as
compared to the 2025 Adopted Budget, based on
economic indicators.

The decrease in capital from 2025 is due mainly to
the 2025 appropriation of capital for the multi-year
light rail reconstruction effort that was budgeted at
$145 million in 2025 for downtown track, and unused
appropriations are carried forward into 2026. This
reconstruction effort will ensure RTD’s light rail track
and related infrastructure, that opened for revenue
service beginning in 1994, is maintained in a state of
good repair.

D
R

Grant revenue is expected to decrease $39 million
from the 2025 Adopted Budget to $309 million due
to the one-time, pass-through East Colfax Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Project included in the 2025 Adopted
Budget. However, RTD’s primary source of ongoing
grant revenue from Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) Section 5307 preventive maintenance grants
will continue to be a significant source of funding
in 2026. Staff will continue to explore additional grant
opportunities through the FTA. This will be especially
critical during 2026, as congress is expected to
update the five-year reauthorization of highway
transit formula grants.
Overall, revenue plus available reserves are
anticipated to keep pace with expected
expenditures in 2026.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for 2026 are largely driven
by the TAM Plan. Details of these budgeted
capital expenditures are provided herein.

Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Book

To achieve 2026 Budget for operating expense,
RTD has incorporated a number of cost-saving
opportunities. Various service contract savings
are estimated at $17 million. The closed, salaried
employees’ pension plan contribution is budgeted
at $7 million in 2026 as compared to $15 million in
the prior year, as it is adequately funded. Vacancies
are targeted at $7 million in savings, and overtime
modifications may result in $5 million in savings. The
2025 non-represented merit increase as a lump sum
will result in $4 million in savings. In addition to no
movement within salary bands related to 2024-2025
merit, the 2026 Proposed Budget does not include
merit for the 2025-2026 performance period. The
proposed budget also does not include an allotment
for a market adjustment or Cost of Living Adjustment
(COLA). This is difficult news for RTD staff; however,
RTD leadership is committed to transparency and
fiduciary responsibility.

Summary
Overall, the 2026 Proposed Budget includes a 5% or
$73 million reduction in revenue and a 10% or $120
million reduction in operating expenses. However,
factoring in debt service and capital expenditures,
total expenditures are expected to continue
exceeding revenue, as was the case in 2023 and in
the 2024 Adopted Budget, which reduced available
reserves in those years. The 2026 Proposed Budget
includes a $57 million lower debt service requirement
due to proposed defeasance or prepayment of debt
in December of 2025. These considerations deliver a
balanced budget with reserves and according to the
RTD Fiscal Policy in 2026.

During fiscal year 2026, RTD will continue to pursue
the Strategic Initiative of Customer and Community
Connections, as well as three more new focused
initiatives: Enhancing Public Trust, Building a Better
RTD, and Service Excellence. Each has been
developed by subject-matter-expert teams after
analyzing agency performance data and the results of
annual customer, community, and employee surveys.

FT

The 2021–2026 Strategic Plan allows for
modifications, as necessary, with Board approval.
Work tactics surrounding the four Strategic Initiatives
may change during the year, at the direction of the
General Manager and CEO, to ensure the agency is
agile and able to address environmental conditions
and changing needs.

Efforts continue on the CO 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
project, which will optimize regional connectivity
and mobility between Boulder County’s two largest
municipalities, Boulder and Longmont, when the
service is introduced in 2027. BRT is an innovative,
high-capacity, lower-cost public transit solution
designed to provide customers with more reliable,
convenient, faster, and more frequent service than
traditional bus service.

D

A

The System Optimization Plan (SOP) will continually
be evaluated as it is the agency’s currently branded
Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA)
during 2026, and service plan modifications will
be implemented in accordance with this process
during the planned January, May, and September
2026 service changes. RTD may make other service
changes during the year, with Board approval,
if necessary.

Completion of the Facilities and Fleet Transition
Plan Study, which evaluates alternative low- and
no-emission fuel technologies, will continue to be
evaluated with the Board of Directors, and any
recommended future changes contemplated during
FY 2026 for potential implementation in future years.
RTD will continue to participate in planning
discussions regarding passenger rail service from
Denver Union Station to Fort Collins. In June, the
Board approved an intergovernmental agreement
(IGA) to facilitate further analysis and discussions
around potential joint passenger rail service in the
northwest corridor.

Potential new state funding sources, including oil and

Funding for this multi-phased reconstruction project
will be carried over for the unused portion of the
2024 Budget appropriation of $152 million. Staff
will continue to evaluate these TAM Plan funding
needs as additional rail condition assessment
information is collected, particularly regarding the
agency’s embedded track. An increase to the Capital
Replacement Fund during 2025 will provide additional
funding for future TAM needs.

As part of its Asset Management Plan, RTD invests
in the regular refresh of servers, network equipment,
and devices such as laptops and desktop computers.
This ongoing cycle ensures that technology remains
secure, reliable, and aligned with modern standards,
while also equipping employees with up-to-date
tools to better serve customers. By continually
modernizing its infrastructure, the agency reinforces
its commitment to sustaining long-term
service excellence.

RTD will continue the multi-year Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project in 2026. Ensuring that assets
are in a state of good repair is one of the agency’s
highest priorities, guaranteeing that previous
investments remain intact, supporting safe and
accessible services, preserving a reliable transit
infrastructure, and extending the design life of key
transportation efforts. During this important work,
which aligns with the Transit Asset Management
(TAM) Plan, RTD is committed to keeping customers
informed, supported, and able to complete their
regular trips using alternate lines or bus routes.

Revenue in 2026 is budgeted to decrease compared
to the 2025 Budget. 2026 customer fares were
estimated to increase 8% over the 2025 budget
due to slight growth in ridership and increased fare
inspections. Fares continue to provide approximately
5% of RTD’s revenues. Through July 2025, sales and
use taxes have increased 1.2% from 2024. The 2026
Budget includes an assumed 2.9% decrease in tax
collections from 2025, as outlined in the September
2025 30-year tax forecast provided by the University
of Colorado Leeds School of Business.

FT

Sales and use taxes comprise approximately 69%
of RTD’s revenue sources in 2026. Grant revenue
includes a one-time, pass-through grant of $187
million to the City and County of Denver for the East
Colfax Avenue BRT Project, which is anticipated to
open for revenue service in 2027.

This pass-through grant has no net financial impact
to RTD. The 2026 budgeted grant net revenue
is primarily comprised of FTA Section 5307 grant
annual apportionments for preventive maintenance.
Other income comprises just 2.5% of total revenue
and consists of investment income, advertising, and
other miscellaneous revenue. It is expected to be
relatively flat when compared to 2025. RTD forecasts
its revenues conservatively to ensure that only
reasonably certain funding sources are contemplated
when developing expenditures and considering fiscal
constraints. This approach provides improved budget
certainty while also supporting fiscal sustainability.

Insurance costs are relatively small in relation to
overall expenses but are expected to increase in
2025 due to claims experience and increasing
premiums, primarily for general liability insurance.
RTD is self-insured for general liability and worker’s
compensation claims. RTD has certain excess liability
limits under the Colorado Government Immunity Act
for claims involving personal injury and property damage.
Purchased transportation will decrease by $38
million, primarily due to a decrease in the payment
for commuter rail based on the concessionaire
agreement. Purchased transportation was also
decreased somewhat for fixed route bus to match
current rates of expenditures.

FT

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses will decrease in 2026 compared
to the 2025 Budget. Salaries and benefits have
decreased $22 million due to excluding merit
increases for 2026 for non-represented employees,
eliminating PTO sellback, and deferring hiring of
vacant positions until later in the year. Retirement
benefits have decreased due to reducing the lump
sum contribution to the closed, non-represented
employee pension plan from $15 million to $6.5
million, as it is deemed sufficiently funded. These
reductions in salaries and benefits were offset
somewhat by the increased wage rates for
represented employees that were negotiated and
agreed to in the most recent Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA).

A

Materials and supplies increased $1 million, and were
matched more closely with 2025 utilization rates for
fuel, revenue vehicle parts, and other consumables.
These expenditures could change as RTD approaches
the opportunity to lock a price for diesel fuel for 2026.

D
R

Outside services also decreased to more closely align
with current expenditure levels.
Utilities, which are primarily comprised of energy
costs for facilities and traction power, are decreasing
to better align with current rates and usage.
Leases and rentals comprise a small portion of RTD’s
expenses, and those costs will go down in 2026
compared to 2025. These costs are primarily related
to facility leases such as the Civic Center building,
and other certain smaller agreements associated with
communication towers and storage facilities.
The other expenses category includes miscellaneous
transactions and adjustments.

Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan

The TAM Plan’s purpose extends beyond compliance,
it is RTD’s public case for investment, demonstrating
to the Board, federal partners, and the communities
served that the agency is managing assets
responsibly and transparently. Through this Plan, RTD
shows how limited taxpayer resources are prioritized
to sustain safe, reliable service and long-term
system value.

A

FT

RTD’s TAM Plan outlines the policies, processes, and
data that guide the management of transit assets
throughout their entire life cycles, from acquisition
to renewal, replacement, and retirement. The Plan
ensures that asset decisions are risk-informed,
performance-based, financially sustainable, and that
they directly support RTD’s mission to make lives
better through connections and its vision to be the
trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and
value to our customers and community.

reducing operational risk, and ensuring investments
achieve full design life. These practices will be
extended across additional asset classes including
facilities, and systems infrastructure.

D
R

This Plan is a primary input to RTD’s Five-Year
Financial Forecast (FYFF) and annual budget, ensuring
capital and operating resources are prioritized
toward maintaining a State of Good Repair (SGR) and
maximizing long-term asset value. Through the Asset
Management Plan (AMP), RTD translates knowledge
into investment priorities that aim to balance cost, risk,
and performance and equity across asset classes.
Over the current planning horizon, RTD is focused
on maturing the agency’s Asset Information Maturity
(AIM), the accuracy, completeness, and utility of data
that underpin all asset related decisions. This multiyear effort improves the integration between asset
condition and performance data, risk assessments,
and financial planning, providing a stronger
foundation for both strategic and tactical decisionmaking. As data quality improves, RTD’s TAM Planning
framework will evolve.

Attachment: Budget_Book_2026_Corrected_2025-11-10 (5229 : 2026 Proposed Budget)

The Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is a
cornerstone of RTD’s Asset Management System,
providing the foundation for how the agency manages
more than $9 billion in capital assets to deliver
safe, reliable, and equitable transit service across
the Denver metro region. The Plan aligns with both
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations (49
CFR Part 625) and internationally recognized asset
management principles (ISO 55000) to ensure the
sustainable stewardship of public infrastructure.

Recent TAM enhancements, such as the age-minus
methodology for light rail track renewals, demonstrate
RTD’s commitment to improving asset performance,

Five-Year Financial Forecast

The FYFF provides the basis for preparation of the annual budget and the 30-year long-range financial plan.
For budgeting purposes, the FYFF provides target funding to help ensure fiscal sustainability. Combined with
RTD’s Fiscal Policy to maintain certain reserve levels as well as the 2021–2026 Strategic Plan, the FYFF ensures
that budget appropriations are aligned with expectations of Financial Success and maintenance of a healthy
financial position.

The 2026–2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) was provided to the Board on September 30, 2025. The
FYFF is not an appropriation, but a planning tool, which is useful from a financial perspective to evaluate fiscal
sustainability. In addition to this five-year forecast, RTD also periodically prepares a 30-year long-range financial
plan that is submitted to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), the federally designated

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Debt Service Defeasance - Certificates of
Participation

November 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve defeasance of 2026 debt service for Certificates of Participation
(COP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Director, Treasury
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) shows that maintaining net revenue coverage equal to or
greater than 1.2x as required by the Fiscal Policy will be challenging in the coming years. To create
relief for the net revenue coverage calculation for 2026, staff examined various financing options, one
of which was deferring and extending the repayment of certain debt service obligations, commonly
referred to as “scoop and toss,” to reduce debt service payments during 2026. After a rigorous
examination, staff and external advisors determined that the costs of executing this option in a manner
that is helpful for 2026, which would include the repayment of such borrowing over a subsequent fiveyear period, would likely exceed $5 million.
A more efficient option that has an equally beneficial impact on debt service and net revenue coverage
in 2026, without the additional increased interest cost is the prepayment in 2025 of certain debt
obligations due and payable in 2026. This technique is referred to as defeasing a debt obligation to
maturity.
A defeasance is a financial technique in which an issuer sets aside cash in an irrevocable escrow held
by a financial institution (typically the related bond trustee) to cover, together with investment earnings,
future principal and interest payments on an existing obligation. The cash is invested in U.S.
Government Treasury Bonds maturing prior to the need to fund scheduled payments of principal and
interest on the defeased obligations. Bondholders are paid all due principal and interest on the
scheduled payment dates from funds deposited in the escrow account, and bondholders can only look
to the escrow for payment. This process discharges the issuer's payment obligation for the defeased
obligations, allowing those debt obligations to be removed from the issuer's balance sheet for financial
reporting purposes, even though the original debt remains outstanding until the escrow fully repays the

Packet Pg. 194

1.D.5

obligation on its payment date. This is a technique that RTD has used in the past when refunding or
refinancing debt.
In 2026, RTD is scheduled to make the following principal and interest payments:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2020
Principal: $3,525,000
Interest: $3,083,875
Certificates of Participation, Series 2023
Principal: $9,965,000
Interest: $369,125
Certificates of Participation, Series 2025
Principal: $14,115,000
Interest: $4,117,375
Total: $35,175,375
DISCUSSION
The proposed Five-Year Financial Forecast and proposed 2026 budget were developed with the
assumption that RTD would execute a defeasance of $57,277,185, which includes that identified above.
Without executing this defeasance, operating expense would need to be reduced in 2026 if the budget
were to remain compliant with the 1.2x net revenue coverage ratio requirement of the Fiscal Policy.
Staff has engaged RTD’s bond counsel, Hogan Lovells; financial advisor, Hilltop Securities; COP trustee,
UMB Bank; and a verification agent, Causey Demgen & Moore, to assist with developing the attached
documents, which will be used if RTD moves forward with this defeasance. The documents include an
RTD resolution for COP payment defeasance and an escrow agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Executing this defeasance in 2025 would allow the 2026 budget to remain compliant with the Fiscal
Policy requirement to maintain a net revenue coverage ratio of 1.2x based on revenue and expense in
the 2026 Proposed Budget that was posted for public inspection on October 10, 2025.

same become due, the parties hereto mutually undertake, promise and agree for themselves and
their respective representatives, successors and assigns, as follows:
Section 1.

Creation of Escrow.

A.
On the date hereof there shall be purchased, with $__________ of legally
available funds provided by the District, the Federal Securities (as defined in the Indentures)
shown in Exhibit 1 to this Escrow Agreement (the “Initial Federal Securities”) and the Initial

Attachment: 2026 Debt Service Defeasance - Certificates of Participation - Escrow Agreement (5225 : 2026 Debt Service Defeasance -

1.D.5.b

-2\\4160-0290-6976 v5

Packet Pg. 208

Federal Securities and an initial cash deposit of $__________ (the “initial deposit”) shall be
credited to and accounted for in a separate trust account designated as the “Defeased Certificate
of Participation Payments, Escrow Account” (the “Escrow Account”). Receipt of $__________
by the Escrow Agent to be applied as provided herein is hereby acknowledged.
B.
To the extent such action is not inconsistent herewith or with the
Indentures, other Federal Securities may be substituted for the Initial Federal Securities if such
Initial Federal Securities are unavailable for purchase on the date hereof or other Federal
Securities may be substituted for any Federal Securities held in the Escrow Account if such
substitution is required or permitted by Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Tax Code”), and the applicable regulations thereunder, subject in any case to
sufficiency demonstrations and yield proofs in a certified public accountant's report, and subject
to a favorable opinion of the District's special counsel as to the legality of any such substitution,
and the continued exemption of interest on the Certificates from federal income taxation (except
certain alternative minimum taxes described in special counsel's opinion), and in any event in
such a manner so as not to increase the price paid for the initial acquisition of Federal Securities
for the Escrow Account. The certified public accountant's report must indicate that the receipts
from the substitute securities are sufficient without any need for reinvestment to fully pay the
Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements. In lieu of, or in addition to, substituting other
Federal Securities pursuant to the preceding sentence, moneys in an amount equal to the
principal of and interest on all or any portion of such Initial Federal Securities may be credited to
the Escrow Account subject to the provisions of Section 5 hereof. Any such cash shall be
deemed to be part of the initial deposit. Any Federal Securities temporarily substituted may be
withdrawn from the Escrow Account when the Initial Federal Securities are purchased and
credited to the Escrow Account. Similarly, any temporary advancement of moneys to the
Escrow Account to pay designated Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements, because of a
failure to receive promptly the principal of and interest on any Federal Securities at their
respective fixed maturity dates, or otherwise, may be repaid to the person advancing such
moneys upon the receipt by the Escrow Agent of such principal and interest payments on such
Federal Securities.
C.
The initial deposit, the proceeds of the Initial Federal Securities (and of
any other Federal Securities acquired as an investment or reinvestment of moneys accounted for
in the Escrow Account), and any such Federal Securities themselves (other than Federal
Securities, including the Initial Federal Securities, held as book-entries) shall be deposited with
the Escrow Agent and credited to and accounted for in the Escrow Account. The securities and
moneys accounted for therein shall be redeemed and paid out and otherwise administered by the
Escrow Agent for the benefit of the District and the owners of the Certificates as provided in this
Escrow Agreement and the Indentures.
Section 2.

Purpose of Escrow.

A.
The Escrow Agent shall hold the initial deposit, all Federal Securities
accounted for in the Escrow Account (other than any Federal Securities, including the Initial
Federal Securities, held as book-entries), and all moneys received from time to time as interest
on and principal of such Federal Securities (including those held as book-entries), in trust to

secure and for the payment of the Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements, as the same
become due.
B.
Except as provided in paragraph B of Section 1 and in Section 8 hereof,
the Escrow Agent shall collect the principal of and interest on such Federal Securities promptly
as such principal and interest become due and shall apply all money so collected to the payment
of the Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements as aforesaid.
Section 3.

Accounting for Escrow.

A.
The moneys and the Federal Securities accounted for in the Escrow
Account shall not be subject to checks drawn by the Corporation or the District or otherwise
subject to the order of the Corporation or the District except as otherwise provided in
paragraph B of Section 1 and in Section 8 hereof.
B.
From amounts on deposit in the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall
make the transfers required by Section 7 hereof to permit the payment, without any default, of
the Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements as the same become due.
C.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph B of Section 1 hereof, there
shall be no sale of any Federal Securities held hereunder, and no Federal Securities held
hereunder and callable for prior redemption at the District's option shall be called at any time for
prior redemption, except if necessary to avoid a default in the payment of the Defeased
Certificate Payment Requirements.
Section 4.

Maturities of Federal Securities.

A.
Federal Securities shall not be callable by the issuer thereof and shall be
purchased in such manner:
(1)
So that such Federal Securities may be redeemed in due season at
their respective maturities to meet the Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements as the
same become due; and
(2)
So that any sale or prior redemption of such Federal Securities
shall be unnecessary.
B.
There shall be no substitution of any Federal Securities except as
otherwise provided in paragraph B of Section 1 hereof.
Section 5.

Reinvestments.

A.
The Escrow Agent shall reinvest the cash balances listed in Exhibit 1
(including Exhibit A therein) for the period designated therein, if any, in state and local
government series securities (“slgs”) purchased directly from the United States Government by
the Escrow Agent in the name of the District. All of the slgs in which such reinvestments are
made shall bear interest at the rate of zero percent (0%) per annum. The Escrow Agent agrees to

subscribing for and purchasing such slgs, including without limitation, requirements with respect
to submitting subscriptions to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch in advance of the date of

shall invest the initial cash, if any, and shall reinvest in Federal Securities any moneys received
in payment of the principal of and interest on any Federal Securities accounted for in the Escrow
Account. The Corporation’s direction shall be subject to the limitations of Sections 1, 4 and 6
hereof and the following limitations. In providing written direction to the Escrow Agent, the
Corporation certifies that the investment does not fail to comply with any limitations of Sections
1, 4, 6, or as follows:
(1)
Any such Federal Securities shall not be subject to redemption
prior to their respective maturities at the option of their issuer.
(2)
Any such Federal Securities shall mature on or prior to the date
when the proceeds thereof must be available for the prompt payment of the Defeased
Certificate Payment Requirements, as the same become due.

Under no circumstances shall any reinvestment be made under this
Section if such reinvestment, alone or in combination with any other investment or
reinvestment, violates the applicable provisions of Section 148 of the Tax Code, and the
rules and regulations thereunder.
(4)
The District shall have furnished to the Escrow Agent a written
opinion of the District's special counsel to the effect that such reinvestment, as described
in the opinion, complies with subparagraph B(3) of this Section.

accounted for in the Escrow Account shall be in an amount (or have appropriate maturities and
yields to produce an amount) which at all times shall be sufficient to pay the Defeased Certificate
Payment Requirements as they become due.
Section 7.
Transfers for Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements.
The Escrow Agent shall make such credit arrangements and transfers to the trustee for the
Certificates (the “Trustee”) as will assure, to the extent of money in the Escrow Account
properly allocable to and available therefor, the timely payment of the Defeased Certificate
Payment Requirements when due. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the sufficiency
of the Escrow Account.
Section 8.
Termination of Escrow Account. When payment or provisions
for payment shall have been made so that all Defeased Certificate Payment Requirements shall
have been paid in full and discharged, the Escrow Agent shall immediately pay over to the

final report to the District and the Corporation. Such moneys may be used by the District for any
lawful purpose, subject to any limitations in the Indentures.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Debt Service Defeasance - FasTracks Bonds

November 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve defeasance of 2026 debt service for FasTracks Bonds.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Director, Treasury
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) shows that maintaining net revenue coverage equal to or
greater than 1.2x as required by the Fiscal Policy will be challenging in the coming years. To create
relief for the net revenue coverage calculation for 2026, staff examined various financing options, one
of which was deferring and extending the repayment of certain debt service obligations, commonly
referred to as “scoop and toss,” to reduce debt service payments during 2026. After a rigorous
examination, staff and external advisors determined that the costs of executing this option in a manner
that is helpful for 2026, which would include the repayment of such borrowing over a subsequent fiveyear period, would likely exceed $5 million.
A more efficient option that has an equally beneficial impact on debt service and net revenue coverage
in 2026, without the additional increased interest cost is the prepayment in 2025 of certain debt
obligations due and payable in 2026. This technique is referred to as defeasing a debt obligation to
maturity.
A defeasance is a financial technique in which an issuer sets aside cash in an irrevocable escrow held
by a financial institution (typically the related bond trustee) to cover, together with investment earnings,
future principal and interest payments on an existing obligation. The cash is invested in U.S.
Government Treasury Bonds maturing prior to the need to fund scheduled payments of principal and
interest on the defeased obligations. Bondholders are paid all due principal and interest on the
scheduled payment dates from funds deposited in the escrow account, and bondholders can only look
to the escrow for payment. This process discharges the issuer's payment obligation for the defeased
obligations, allowing those debt obligations to be removed from the issuer's balance sheet for financial
reporting purposes, even though the original debt remains outstanding until the escrow fully repays the

Packet Pg. 220

1.D.6

obligation on its payment date. This is a technique that RTD has used in the past when refunding or
refinancing debt.
In 2026, RTD is scheduled to make the following principal and interest payments:
FasTracks Bonds, Series 2022AB
Principal: $12,130,000
Interest: $9,971,810
Total: $22,101,810
DISCUSSION
The proposed Five-Year Financial Forecast and proposed 2026 budget were developed with the
assumption that RTD would execute a defeasance of $57,277,185, which includes that identified above.
Without executing this defeasance, operating expense would need to be reduced in 2026 if the budget
were to remain compliant with the 1.2x net revenue coverage ratio requirement of the Fiscal Policy.
Staff has engaged RTD’s bond counsel, Hogan Lovells; financial advisor, Hilltop Securities; bond
trustee, Bank of New York; and a verification agent, Causey, Demgen & Moore, to assist with
developing the attached documents which will be used if RTD moves forward with this bond
defeasance. The documents include an RTD resolution for bond payment defeasance and an escrow
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Executing this defeasance in 2025 would allow the 2026 budget to remain compliant with the Fiscal
Policy requirement to maintain a net revenue coverage ratio of 1.2x based on revenue and expense in
the 2026 Proposed Budget that was posted for public inspection on October 10, 2025.

Bonds"); and
WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings set forth in the 2022 Indenture; and
WHEREAS, the District has determined and hereby determines that it is in the

become due, the parties hereto mutually undertake, promise and agree for themselves and their
respective representatives, successors and assigns, as follows:
Section 1.

Creation of Escrow.

A.
On the date hereof there shall be purchased, with $__________ of legally
available funds provided by the District, the Federal Securities (as defined in the Indenture)
shown in Exhibit 1 to this Escrow Agreement (the “Initial Federal Securities”) and the Initial
Federal Securities and an initial cash deposit of $__________ (the “initial deposit”) shall be
credited to and accounted for in a separate trust account designated as the “Defeased Bond
Payments, Escrow Account” (the “Escrow Account”). Receipt of $__________ by the Escrow
Agent to be applied as provided herein is hereby acknowledged.

B.
To the extent such action is not inconsistent herewith or with the
Indenture, other Federal Securities may be substituted for the Initial Federal Securities if such
Initial Federal Securities are unavailable for purchase on the date hereof or other Federal
Securities may be substituted for any Federal Securities held in the Escrow Account if such
substitution is required or permitted by Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Tax Code”), and the applicable regulations thereunder, subject in any case to
sufficiency demonstrations and yield proofs in a certified public accountant's report, and subject
to a favorable opinion of the District's bond counsel as to the legality of any such substitution,
and the continued exemption of interest on the 2022A/B Bonds from federal income taxation
(except certain alternative minimum taxes described in bond counsel's opinion), and in any event
in such a manner so as not to increase the price paid for the initial acquisition of Federal
Securities for the Escrow Account. The certified public accountant's report must indicate that the
receipts from the substitute securities are sufficient without any need for reinvestment to fully
pay the Defeased Bond Payment Requirements. In lieu of, or in addition to, substituting other
Federal Securities pursuant to the preceding sentence, moneys in an amount equal to the
principal of and interest on all or any portion of such Initial Federal Securities may be credited to
the Escrow Account subject to the provisions of Section 5 hereof. Any such cash shall be
deemed to be part of the initial deposit. Any Federal Securities temporarily substituted may be
withdrawn from the Escrow Account when the Initial Federal Securities are purchased and
credited to the Escrow Account. Similarly, any temporary advancement of moneys to the
Escrow Account to pay designated Defeased Bond Payment Requirements, because of a failure
to receive promptly the principal of and interest on any Federal Securities at their respective
fixed maturity dates, or otherwise, may be repaid to the person advancing such moneys upon the
receipt by the Escrow Agent of such principal and interest payments on such Federal Securities.
If the Escrow Agent learns that the Department of the Treasury or the Bureau of
Fiscal Service will not, for any reason, accept a subscription of SLGS that is to be submitted
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly request alternative written
investment instructions from the District with respect to funds which were to be invested in
SLGS. The Escrow Agent shall follow such instructions and, upon the maturity of any such
alternative investment, the Escrow Agent shall hold such funds uninvested and without liability
for interest until receipt of further written instructions from the District. In the absence of
investment instructions from the District, the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the
investment of such funds or interest thereon. The Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon the
District’s selection of an alternative investment as a determination of the alternative investment's
legality and suitability and shall not be liable for any losses related to the alternative investments
or for compliance with any yield restriction applicable thereto.
C.
The initial deposit, the proceeds of the Initial Federal Securities (and of
any other Federal Securities acquired as an investment or reinvestment of moneys accounted for
in the Escrow Account), and any such Federal Securities themselves (other than Federal
Securities, including the Initial Federal Securities, held as book-entries) shall be deposited with
the Escrow Agent and credited to and accounted for in the Escrow Account. The securities and
moneys accounted for therein shall be redeemed and paid out and otherwise administered by the
Escrow Agent for the benefit of the District and the owners of the 2022A/B Bonds as provided in
this Escrow Agreement and the Indenture.

The Escrow Agent shall reinvest the cash balances listed in Exhibit 1

government series securities (“SLGS”) purchased directly from the United States Government by
the Escrow Agent in the name of the District. All of the SLGS in which such reinvestments are
made shall bear interest at the rate of zero percent (0%) per annum. The Escrow Agent agrees to

invest the initial cash, if any, and shall reinvest in Federal Securities any moneys received in
payment of the principal of and interest on any Federal Securities accounted for in the Escrow
Account. The District’s direction shall be subject to the limitations of Sections 1, 4 and 6 hereof

prior to their respective maturities at the option of their issuer.
(2)
Any such Federal Securities shall mature on or prior to the date
when the proceeds thereof must be available for the prompt payment of the Defeased
Bond Payment Requirements, as the same become due.
(3)
Under no circumstances shall any reinvestment be made under this
Section if such reinvestment, alone or in combination with any other investment or
reinvestment, violates the applicable provisions of Section 148 of the Tax Code, and the
rules and regulations thereunder.
(4)
The District shall have furnished to the Escrow Agent a written
opinion of the District's bond counsel to the effect that such reinvestment, as described in
the opinion, will not adversely affect the federal tax treatment of interest on the 2022A/B
Bonds, and a verification report of an independent accountant or verification agent to the
effect that, after such reinvestment, the securities and funds in the Escrow Account shall
remain sufficient to make the payments of the Defeased Bond Payment Requirements as
they become due and payable.
Section 6.
Sufficiency of Escrow. The moneys and Federal Securities
accounted for in the Escrow Account shall be in an amount (or have appropriate maturities and
yields to produce an amount) which at all times shall be sufficient to pay the Defeased Bond

Section 19. Electronic Transactions and Instructions. The parties hereto
agree that the transactions described herein may be conducted and related documents may be
stored by electronic means. Copies, electronic files and other reproductions of original executed
documents shall be deemed to be authentic and valid counterparts of such original documents for
all purposes, including the filing of any claim, action or suit in the appropriate court of law.
"Electronic means" shall mean the following communications methods: e-mail, secure electronic
transmission containing applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys
issued by the Escrow Agent, or another method or system specified by the Escrow Agent as
available for use in connection with its services hereunder.
The Escrow Agent shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions, including funds
transfer instructions (“Instructions”) given pursuant to this Escrow Agreement and delivered
using electronic means; provided, however, that the District, as applicable, shall provide to the
Escrow Agent an incumbency certificate listing officers with the authority to provide such
Instructions (“Authorized Officers”) and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized
Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended by the District, as applicable, whenever
a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the District, as applicable, elects to give the
Escrow Agent Instructions using electronic means and the Escrow Agent in its discretion elects
to act upon such Instructions, the Escrow Agent’s understanding of such Instructions shall be
deemed controlling. The District understand and agree that the Escrow Agent cannot determine
the identity of the actual sender of such Instructions and that the Escrow Agent shall
conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer
listed on the incumbency certificate provided to the Escrow Agent have been sent by such
Authorized Officer. The District shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers
transmit such Instructions to the Escrow Agent and that the District and all Authorized Officers
are solely responsible to safeguard the use and confidentiality of applicable user and
authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys upon receipt by the District, as
applicable. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly
or indirectly from the Escrow Agent’s reliance upon and compliance with such Instructions
notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction.
The District agree: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of electronic means to submit
Instructions to the Escrow Agent, including without limitation the risk of the Escrow Agent
acting on unauthorized Instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii)
that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of
transmitting Instructions to the Escrow Agent and that there may be more secure methods of
transmitting Instructions than the method(s) selected by the District, as applicable; (iii) that the
security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of Instructions
provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and

circumstances; and (iv) to notify the Escrow Agent immediately upon learning of any
compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures.
Section 20. Bank Removal or Resignation. It is understood that the Escrow
Agent reserves the right to resign at any time by giving written notice of its resignation,
specifying the effective date thereof, to the District and that the District reserves the right to
remove the Escrow Agent at any time by giving written notice of its removal, specifying the
effective date thereof, to the Escrow Agent. Within 30 days after receipt of either of the
aforesaid notice, the District agrees to appoint a successor to which the Escrow Agent shall
transfer the deposits then held and all records pertaining thereto to such successor. If a successor
has not been appointed and has not accepted such appointment by the end of the 30-day period,
the Escrow Agent may apply, at the expense of the District, to a State of Colorado district court
with competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a bank or other financial institution
experienced in such matters as successor and the Escrow Agent shall transfer the deposits then
held and all records pertaining thereto to such successor.

enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Colorado.

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that Regional Transportation District, Colorado

(the "District"), has caused to be deposited in escrow with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., moneys which will be invested in certificates of indebtedness, notes, bonds and
similar securities which are direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on
which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America to pay and discharge all
of the principal (consisting of mandatory sinking fund redemption payments) and interest due
and payable in calendar year 2026 on the District's Taxable (Convertible to Tax-Exempt) Sales
Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2022A (the "2022A Bonds"), and its Taxable
(Convertible to Tax-Exempt) Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2022B (the
"2022B Bonds" and together with the 2022A Bonds, the "2022A/B Bonds") as more particularly
described below.
B.

All of the principal (consisting of mandatory sinking fund redemption payments)

and interest due and payable in calendar year 2026 on the 2022A/B Bonds, as further described
below (the "Defeased Payments") are defeased to their scheduled payment dates as of
__________, 2025 (the "Defeasance Date"). On the Defeasance Date, an amount sufficient to
pay the principal (consisting of mandatory sinking fund redemption payments) and interest due
and payable in calendar year 2026 on the 2022A/B Bonds on their scheduled payment dates will
be deposited with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the "Defeased

The defeasance of the Defeased Payments does not constitute a legal defeasance of any of the
Series 2022A/B Bonds and therefore the District’s obligations under the Defeased Bonds are not
discharged as a result of the defeasance of the Defeased Payments.
C.

According to a report of a firm of certified public accountants, licensed to practice

in Colorado, the escrow, including the known minimum yield from such investments and any
temporary reinvestments and the initial cash balance remaining uninvested, will be fully
sufficient at the time of the deposit and at all times subsequent, to pay the Deafeased Payments
on their scheduled payment dates.
D.

Pursuant to federal law, the Defeased Payments Escrow Agent is required to

withhold a portion of the payments of the Defeased Payments unless the Defeased Payments
Escrow Agent has been provided with your Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification
Number, properly certified or submitted on a Form W-9.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Long-Range Financial Plan serves as an extension of the Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF)
through the 30-year time horizon, which is currently 2055. This plan is submitted to the Denver
Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), the federally designated metropolitan planning
organization for the Denver region pursuant to the Federal Transit Act, 23 U.S.C. 5301, et seq. DRCOG
will incorporate RTD’s plan along with the plans of other member governments and partners in the
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) that is updated every four years as required by 23 CFR § 450.324 in
order for projects to receive federal funding. The RTP guides the long-range vision and investment
framework for the region’s multimodal transportation system. DRCOG relies on financial forecasts
developed by RTD to determine the amount of funding available for use in RTD’s transit network. RTD’s
lenders also utilize the plan to ensure that RTD has the financial capacity to repay its debt.
DISCUSSION
The Long-Range Financial Plan focuses on evaluating whether RTD can fund the ongoing operation and
maintenance of the Base System and the FasTracks corridors while repaying its debt obligations. Key
elements of the plan for the years 2026-2055 include the following:
•

Revenue Projections
o Sales-and-use tax forecasts from the September 2025 forecast from the Leeds School of
Business at the University of Colorado Boulder
o Fare revenue forecasts based on the current pricing structure, $0.25 increases every three
years (a change previously indicated in the Discussion Item) and existing fare check
strategy with DRCOG ridership projections
o Future formula grants forecast based on historic appropriations, escalated at the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)

•

Operations and Capital Replacement
o Continued operating costs based on the final year of the FYFF, escalated at 3% CPI with
vehicle, hour and mile adjustments for increased transit utilization
o Replacement of revenue fleet and other assets based on current asset inventory and
replacement schedules
o Replacement of maintenance facilities as projected to be required
o Issuance of additional Certificates of Participation (COPs) in the FYFF to fund a portion of
capital replacement requirements
o Any incremental costs (capital and operations) for DRCOG RTP bus rapid transit (BRT)
corridors above those funding levels currently provided by RTD that would be paid for
and financed by stakeholder project sponsors
Reserves
o A balance of three months’ operating expenses in the Board-appropriated operating
reserve
o Short-term use of FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to fund FasTracks state of
good repair efforts in the FYFF
o Reserves fully utilized with a gap between revenue projections and expenditure
requirements
Other Assumptions Beyond the FYFF
o That the Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Operators for the A, B, and G Lines
remains in place through 2044, with RTD assuming operations thereafter
o That the entire light rail system will be converted to level boarding
o That a new bus operating facility will be built or acquired
o That a new light rail operating facility located in the eastern portion of the light rail
system will be built
o That the existing Automatic Block Signals System for light rail is converted to a
Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) Moving Block Signal System
o That the agency does not assume ownership of private contractor bus operations
facilities

The Long-Range Financial Plan does not incorporate proposed defeasance of a portion of 2026 debt
obligations.
Implementation of the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan would add approximately $1.4B to the capital
costs above what is listed in the Long-Range Financial Plan schedules. Due to complexities and
unknowns in the fleet replacement schedules, the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan is not able to be
incorporated into the Long-Range Financial Plan by year at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended Long-Range Financial Plan does not provide RTD with the means to maintain its
current system in a state of good repair through 2055. Between 2026 and 2055, RTD would not have the
capacity for service expansion or new projects beyond those needed to maintain a state of good repair,
and the FISA alone would not be sufficient to fund the unfunded FasTracks corridors.

1.D.7

Unrestricted funds and capital replacement reserves are fully utilized by 2031 for the existing
infrastructure state of good repair. Additional debt issuance and revenue is required in the Long-Range
Financial Plan.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
July 2025 Five-Year Financial Forecast

November 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the July 2025 Five-Year Financial Forecast
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The July 2025 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) for 2026-2030 is the financial forecast used as the
basis for the development of the 2026 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future years’
financial planning.
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous financial
forecast, the 2025-2029 FYFF, was approved by the Board in September 2024.
The FYFF was prepared using currently available information to assist in planning. The FYFF is a
forecast or projection of financial results, is not an appropriation of funds, and is non-binding.
During the July 15, 2025, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item that
described the purpose of and assumptions used in the FYFF. During the September 9, 2025, Finance
and Planning Committee, staff presented an action item for adoption of the 2026-2030 FYFF, which was
approved. The Board of Directors voted on September 30, 2025, to return the action item to the Finance
and Planning Committee meeting for further review.
DISCUSSION
The FYFF has been prepared using currently available information and does not include assumptions
regarding future potential changes, such as new grant funding from SB24-184 Congestion Impact Fees
and SB24-230 Oil and Gas Production Fees. The FYFF only includes funding sources and use
projections that have reasonable certainty to occur in accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal
Policy.

Packet Pg. 256

1.D.8

Other requirements of the Fiscal Policy to consider for the FYFF include the following:
•
•

A balanced budget in which beginning reserves plus total anticipated revenues is greater
than or equal to expenditures will be prepared
Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The FYFF projects continued adherence to Fiscal Policy requirements and maintenance of adequate
reserves to continue to cash-fund expenditures while providing the necessary funding to support
currently known Transit Asset Management Plan needs.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Triennial Update to Reimagine RTD – Mobility Plan for the
Future

November 11, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brian Welch, Senior Manager, Planning Technical Services
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2018, RTD recognized that the landscape of surface transportation was in a state of flux and put in
motion several complementary efforts and initiatives. These efforts were collectively referred to as
“Transportation Transformation” and included the following vision:
•
•
•

Transit systems need to make themselves more competitive now
It is time for a public transportation renaissance
The future of mobility depends on public transportation: practical, sustainable solutions that
meet the needs of everyone in the Denver metro area

The signature Transportation Transformation initiative became the Reimagine RTD project, and work
began in late 2019 to develop the Mobility Plan for the Future (MPFF) and the System Optimization Plan
(SOP). The SOP was adopted by the Board in July 2022, and a Board SOP update was presented in
September 2025. The Board endorsed the MPFF in November of 2022, with the understanding that the
MPFF would be reviewed and updated on a no-less-than triennial basis.
DISCUSSION
The overarching Reimagine RTD aspiration is as follows: “Moving everyone forward with solutions.”
Key highlights of the MPFF are presented by four opportunities, describing RTD as follows:
•
•
•
•

Access: A mobility integrator that provides a regional transit backbone and partners with
stakeholders
Equity: A mobility provider prioritizing service to those most in need
Sustainability: A mobility leader that defines and evolves transit’s role through innovation and
collaboration
Financial: A mobility agency that is well-funded, financially stable, and serves as a good steward
of taxpayer dollars while supporting regional access, equity, and sustainability

Note that these opportunities are harmonized with the strategic priorities and success outcomes
described in the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan. The attached presentation also includes a three-year update

Packet Pg. 270

1.E.1

to the MPFF implementation plan, which is linked to the Strategic Plan and is organized on a temporal
and financial basis. Key implementation steps include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Implement a partnership program (the MPFF meets the Community Value Strategic Priority)
Collaborate with CDOT/local partners to implement regional Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service (the
MPFF meets the Community Value Strategic Priority)
Develop a zero-emission fleet transition plan (the MPFF meets the Community Value Strategic
Priority)
Integrate services and modes through development of a trip planning and payment platform (the
MPFF meets the Customer Excellence Strategic Priority)
Continue to foster a dynamic, diverse workforce that attracts and retains valued people (the
MPFF meets the Employee Ownership Strategic Priority)
Continue to seek opportunities to enhance transit safety (the MPFF meets the Community Value
Strategic Priority)
Initiate a formal effort to collaborate with state and local partners to increase transit funding in
the region (the MPFF meets the Financial Success Strategic Priority)

Moving forward in 2026 and beyond, key long-range planning initiatives related to the MPFF include:
•
•
•
•
•

Light Rail Level-Boarding Feasibility Study
New Bus Maintenance Facility Alternative Analysis (AA) and National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) Study
Bus Stop Infrastructure Accessibility Assessment
Park-n-Ride Assessment
Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA)

Setting long-range planning priorities for the agency beyond the current MPFF will occur using the COA
as a cornerstone. The COA will establish a five-year plan for service and develop aspirations for service
beyond five years, both of which are contingent upon funding. The COA will establish a baseline from
which the agency can build to determine long-term priorities for asset renewal and other infrastructure
investments related to system modernization and expansion. This process is expected to begin in 2027
following the completion of the COA.
