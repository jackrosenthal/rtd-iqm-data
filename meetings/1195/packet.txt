B. JCECA Recognition
Frank Buczkowski, Senior Manager of Systems Integrations, read a letter from
Jefferson County Emergency Communications Authority (JCECA) to the Board and
introduced Jeff Irvin, the Executive Director of JCECA. This letter can be found in
the July 2, 2013 FasTracks Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.
Jeff Irvin further explained that JCECA serves local government agencies in both
Broomfield and Jefferson counties. They collect an emergency telephone charge
which citizens in each county pay when paying their phone bills and use it to fund
911 in the region. There are 28 local government agencies, consisting of mostly
police and fire agencies, that form the JCECA inter-governmental agreement.
JCECA supports 10 public safety answering points, 7 of which are primary law
enforcement communication centers and 3 of which are fire and EMS
communication centers. He then gave some details on Next Generation 911, which
is IP based, including video, biometrics, and other types of information that can aid
a first responder with some pre-arrival instruction to help save lives. The
opportunity with the fiber has been just incredible, Irvin related. RTD staff has been
amazing to work with and JCECA has enjoyed a very professional relationship with
the Board, which has fostered a one-of-a-kind project. As a representative of
JCECA, he would like to thank RTD for the collaboration on enabling what is now
and will continue to be in the future a highly secure and profitable network. Beyond
the scope of the project JCECA is currently working on (from the Jefferson County
government campus to the Auraria Higher Education Center), they are now working
on a connection to the Denver Union Station hub and to the gold line, which will
help us connect even more of our agencies in Westminster and Arvada. This has
been an incredible effort which has continued to expand and which is providing an
amazing opportunity for local government and public safety to create this network
to serve all of the citizens in the metro area eventually.

C. Updates
Bill Van Meter introduced Chris Quinn as the planning project manager for
the Northwest Area Mobility Study Board. Mr. Quinn thanked the Board and
provided the following status update. He stated that when the planning
staff got the most recent cost estimate about a year and a half ago, they
realized they would not be able to construct the corridor immediately and it
became their goal to provide the stakeholders with alternatives in the shorter
term. They selected HNTB as their consultant at the end of March and
established a technical advisory committee and policy advisory committee
consisting of elected officials of the region. On May 29, they held a
collaboration summit to establish goals and objectives for a study which
they would use to measure successful outcomes. Key tasks of the study
include determining the remaining BRT funding priority for US 36, evaluating
the possibility of segmenting the northwest rail corridor, evaluating the
potential for extending the north metro corridor, and evaluating potential
mobility improvements such as BRT type improvements in the arterial
roadway network, as well as addressing issues of reverse commutes on the
downtown express. The two key pieces to keep in mind are that there are
several decisions that they expect to have wrapped up by mid-summer and
by March of 2014 they expect to have a final report of recommendations.
Chris Quinn then presented information in a PowerPoint presentation, which
can be found in the July 2, 2013 agenda packet. He indicated that the
general focus currently is on identifying problems and potential
solutions/alternatives. Public involvement to date has included 2 telephone
town hall meetings. The first meeting had about 5,300 participants and the
2nd one had about 5,400 participants. It was a pretty clear success and they
would like to continue to use this tool in the future. Their website allows
people to ask questions, submit comments and sign up for newsletters and
to hear about activities. He then opened the floor for any questions.
Chair Anderson noted that there were 5,300 participants in the first meeting
and about 5,400 in the 2nd. She asked how many of the participants calledin each evening versus being reached through out-bound phone calls
conducted by the contracted automated dialing service. The response was
35 from the first meeting and 48 from the second meeting.
Director Lubow expressed thanks for all the hard work that went into this
study and is hopeful that the stakeholders can reach a consensus on the
issue.
Director Bagley inquired about the PowerPoint slide regarding the key tasks
of the study; he wanted confirmation that his perception was correct on

Director Walker asked if there is any flexibility in the number of open houses
we can have. Mr. Quinn responded that this number is not set in stone. He
stated that typically for this region and district we hold three; one in the
north corridor, one in the middle, and one in the south end.
Director Hoy inquired about alternatives being studied to connect Longmont
to the north metro line and whether a train from Boulder to Longmont is still
an option. Mr. Quinn replied that all options are on the table and they want
to emphasize that unless the voters were to change the plan, the northwest
rail is of course in the plan.
Director Lubow asked if it would be possible to also explore the potential of
using the UP right of way to Valmont. Mr. Quinn responded that it is
something they want to keep on the table and although they do anticipate
some difficulty, as it doesn’t quite reach Boulder, it’s not insurmountable by
any means. Director Lubow then asked whether the data from the first town
hall meeting around people indicating they liked the idea of receiving
information via email would be taken into account and acted upon. Mr.
Quinn assured the Board that email addresses are being accepted and they
intend to send email blasts out as information continues to become
available.
Director James requested more details on the alternatives to BRT mentioned
in the PowerPoint presentation. Mr. Quinn gave the example that CDOT is
currently in the process of evaluating a proposal from Swift Transit who
wants to build a personal rapid transit along 119, connecting Longmont with
Boulder, as a demonstration project. Knowing that there’s a little more
traction on alternative technologies these days is encouraging and they want
to keep an open mind when evaluating proposals.
GM Washington stressed how important it is to reach a consensus so we
can pursue additional funding. The fact is that we don’t currently have the
funding. We will be taking a very deliberate approach to administering the
study this year and conveying the results early next year, as they will be
instrumental in providing mobility options for not only the northwest

what the various lines on the map in the presentation represented. Mr.
Quinn confirmed that the green line is I-25. The next one is Weld County
Road 7, and the purple is an alternative that follows CR7 and verges to miss
some of the development from the last couple of years and by-pass
development on State Highway 119. Then the furthest blue line heading
north-south would utilize 287. The dashed line is where the existing line
now goes out to the Bel-Mar, Belmont Towers. Director Bagley would be
interested to know what the segment distances are and what the time
sequences are going to be for the lines.

corridor, but district-wide. Additional funding is absolutely necessary and
cannot be procured until consensus is reached.

D. Other Matters
Director Tobiassen requested an update on the Colfax corridor study in a future
Board meeting.

B. CAC Update
Hugh Wilson, Co-chair of the Citizens Advisory Committee, briefed the Board about
their recent quarterly meeting in Westminster. He thanked Directors Hoy,
Anderson, Bagley, Lubow and Menten for attending. Hugh Wilson stated that there
were 17 CAC members in attendance. This was a midday meeting so that shows
their dedication as a volunteer group. He said this was the best attendance of any
meeting he has attended. Mayor McNally and all the City Council members from
Westminster attended. There were also several state representatives, mayoral
candidates and citizens in attendance. Hugh Wilson feels their value is in providing
a sounding board and listening board for what the citizens have to say. He shared
there were a number of comments that people in that area are frustrated as they
await action in their corridor.
Hugh Wilson explained that the Committee had not had the chance to discuss the
quarterly meeting. They will be doing this on July 17th. He shared that once they
meet, the Committee would summarize their comments and questions and come
back to the Board with another presentation.
Chair Anderson believes we need to define the technologies that will be in each
corridor; we need to separate the issue of light rail versus commuter rail. She
shared that even in the newspaper there was a headline that said light rail when it
should have been commuter rail. Chair Anderson stated that generally everything
to the north is going to be commuter rail. She feels this is one of the huge
misunderstandings in the whole north corridor. She thought it was a great meeting
and thanked all the CAC members for their service; they really did a great job.
Scott Reed said that staff did contact the reporter to have the article corrected.
Director Lubow thanked the members of the CAC for the service they are doing.
She attended the Westminster meeting and they received a lot of feedback.
Director Lubow stated some of the feedback was hostile and angry but the CAC
members did a great job of listening.
Director Tobiassen thanked the CAC members that are participating in the I-225
corridor meetings. He extended an invitation to the other CAC members to attend.

Director Tobiassen believes keeping the CAC involved in that corridor is going to be
very beneficial.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked Hugh Wilson for coming to Westminster and asked
him to share his thanks with the other members of the Committee. He was very
impressed with the turnout of the Committee. He thinks they handled the meeting
very well. Committee Chair Hoy stated that he will be very interested in the
committee’s feelings after they have had a chance to get together and discuss the
meeting.

C. Updates

• North Metro Request for Proposals (RFP) Overview
Pranaya Shrestha and Jim Starling reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with
the Board that is in the July 2, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee
Agenda Packet.
Pranaya Shrestha shared that staff released the North Metro Rail Request for
Proposal (RFP) on Friday, June 28 at 6:28 p.m. He explained that as part of
the process there are over 4,800 documents the team put together. They
did this in a few months whereas the Eagle P9 project took 2 years to put
together. Pranaya Shrestha shared that the team really worked hard to
incorporate the lessons learned from the Central and I-225 corridors. He
said that as the Board has heard from General Manager Washington, the RFP
stresses innovation and creativity whether it relates to doing other corridors
or extensions, providing the financial means, meeting the DBE/WIN/SBE
goals, etc. Pranaya Shrestha stated that another important aspect that staff
incorporated was sustainability from the way the design is approached all
the way to materials used. He shared that there is a pre-proposal meeting
on July 8th that staff expects most of the proposers to attend.
General Manager Washington reiterated to the Board that staff has set a
very aggressive schedule for the RFP and we are going to stick to that
schedule. He said that many Board members may be approached and asked
to slow down the schedule. General Manager Washington shared that the
same thing happened with the RFP for the I-225 line; potential bidders that
may not be ready want us to extend the various dates and deadlines. He
stressed to the Board that we will not do that; we will push ahead with this
schedule.
Director Deadwyler shared that she attended the North Metro Rail Line
Network and Information meeting back in May. She was very impressed

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly stated he would be very interested to hear back from the CAC now
that many of the members have ridden the West line. He asked for a report on
what they think of the line, any suggestions, interpretations, etc. Hugh Wilson said
he would bring that back to the committee.

with the turnout of the Prime Contractors and DBE Groups. She noted one
of the things General Manager Washington said was that we would be
asking those responding to the RFP to be more innovative and add in some
of the unfinished corridors. She expressed that she does not see that in the
RFP that was released. Pranaya Shrestha explained that the RFP was
broken into three phases: phase 1 is Denver Union Station to 72nd Avenue,
phase 2 is 72nd Avenue to the end of the line, and phase 3 is the extensions.
Director Deadwyler said that she was very stunned by the phases because
she thought the extension of some of the corridors, specifically the Central
corridor, would be included in phase 1. She believes that was the
impression the constituents received at the Network and Information
meeting. Director Deadwyler asked if the contractor would have a choice in
terms of which unfinished corridors they would include in their proposals.
Pranaya Shrestha said that staff is encouraging each potential proposer to
determine the schedule and projects included. General Manager Washington
explained that we did not want to be too prescriptive to the private sector
with the RFP; we do not want to tell the contractor what to do, where to
start, etc. He stated we want to see the creativity when we receive the
proposals. He asked the Board to wait and see what comes back.
Director Deadwyler asked if the money that had been set aside for getting
the Central corridor finished would now be tied up with the RFP. General
Manager Washington stated that we do not have the money set aside to do
the Central corridor within the next 4 years; we are not using money from
anywhere else. Director Deadwyler asked to have further conversations
with staff about the RFP.
Director Lubow thanked staff for working so hard to get this RFP out so
quickly. Director Lubow asked for clarification on the bullet point related to
the RFP Scope that reads: “Includes Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
Record of Decision project limits only”. Bill Van Meter explained that Denver
Union Station to 162nd Avenue were the limits of the EIS; the EIS only needs
to be completed for the North Metro corridor. Director Lubow asked how
the DBE and WIN goals were established for the project. Jim Starling stated
that the RFP team worked very closely with the Civil Rights department to
determine those numbers. General Manager Washington explained that
there is a formula used to determine DBE/SBE goals. The DBE formula is a
federally prescribed formula based on type of work and firms in the database
that can do that type of work. He shared that these goals are part of the
FTA audit and tri-annual review.
Director Bagley commented that often we think of phases from a time
relative perspective. Usually it would be something like phase 1 is year 1,
phase 2 is years 2-6, phase 3 is years 7-11, etc.; however, in the RFP
released it really is better defined as a part than time related.

Committee Chair Hoy said that this is good news. He asked what staff
means when they say the RFP was released. He also asked if stakeholders
have the RFP. Jim Starling stated it is an electronic distribution. Pranaya
Shrestha explained that we provide a link where any potential proposers can
access the 4,800 documents. He said that the RFP is public information so
anyone may request the link. Jim Starling told the Board if they receive any
requests they may put the person in touch with him directly.
Committee Chair Hoy stated that the Board should look to our recent
experience with the I-225 RFP to understand why we want to keep our
options open. We had one bid that went half as far as the others so we
really do not know what we might get back from this RFP. He believes we
should wait to see what the contractors can do.
General Manager Washington believes Director Bagley put the phasing issue
just right. He reminded the Board that we did this with the Eagle P3 project.
This is just a way of doing business.
Director Folska asked how many contractors have picked up the RFP. Jim
Starling said the number was between 40 and 50.

• 2013 FasTracks Public Opinion Survey Results
Pauletta Tonilas thanked the Board for allowing her to present this update.
She explained that this survey helps her team in crafting their messaging
platforms. She introduced Todd Pickton from BBC Research & Consulting
who reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with the Board that is available in
the July 2, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
Committee Chair Hoy commented that he recently saw a presentation that
had similar facts. He feels this confirms much of what he saw in tonight’s
presentation.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker reiterated Director Bagley’s comments. He said it is possible
a proposer could come back with a plan to complete the extensions first.
Director Walker asked for clarification on the bullet point related to the RFP
Scope that reads: “Willing to include related stakeholder projects (nonfederal) to lock in price”. He wondered if that would be something like a
communication study, drainage project, etc. He also asked if the
understanding is that the stakeholders would pay for anything above what
RTD would normally pay. Jim Starling stated that he was correct in the
types of projects and that the cost would depend on the stakeholder.

6.B

Director Folska asked for information on the sample used. She wondered if
all the surveys were conducted over the telephone and what the sample size
was. Todd Pickton explained that all the surveys were conducted over the
telephone and were a combination of land line and mobile phone numbers.
He shared that there were 800 completed surveys. Todd Pickton said that
full demographic information would be reflected in the full report given to
the FasTracks Public Information team. Director Folska thought it was very
interesting how the survey started at the big picture and how in the last
slide it was narrowed down to people’s real concerns. She asked if we are
able to build that kind of messaging going forward. Pauletta Tonilas stated
that is exactly why we have this survey. Her team will look at the data and
craft a message that really speaks to people about the benefits they will see.
Director Folska asked why we did not have Facebook or other social media
listed as a way to disseminate information. Pauletta Tonilas said that is was
on the list but it does not rank very high in how people recall getting
information and how they want to get information. She stated that does not
mean we will stop using social media; it is just not the preferred method
among the demographics captured in this particular survey.
Director Lubow thanked staff and BBC for their survey. She is concerned
about some of the findings that seem more nuanced. For example in looking
at each county’s approval of FasTracks, Boulder is significantly lower than
the others. She also noted that when you look at the impression people
have of the quality of services provided by RTD, “excellent” has gone down
significantly. Director Lubow wonders if we are looking at these nuances
and have decided we are going to do X, Y and Z. Pauletta Tonilas stated
that part of what we are already doing about Boulder is the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS); we are working with stakeholders to have public
information and input process. She also noted that this survey was done at
the end of May into early June when we had some people who were not
pleased with changes that occurred from the West line opening. She
believes this probably plays into the decrease in people responding with
‘excellent’. Pauletta Tonilas shared that when we compare our survey
results to those done by other transit agencies our results rank very high.
Director Daly commented that he is very surprised to see how people wish
to receive information; a very high percentage want to receive information
through newspapers and the mail. He asked for information on the age
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley stated that his assumption is that the questions asked from
2007 through 2013 were much the same in each year. Todd Pickton stated
that if the questions were not identical they were very similar for
comparability. Pauletta Tonilas explained that some of the wording was
changed because the last survey in 2011 had a different intent but staff still
wanted the information to be comparable.

6.B

Director Deadwyler also thanked staff and BBC for the survey. She feels it
shows a lot of what people have been telling her for the last two or three
years in terms of how they are communicated with. She believes based on
our demographics we are reaching the people that really care the most. She
noted that the older generation really likes to get a newsletter or something
in their local community papers. Director Deadwyler is hoping we can
communicate more that way.
Director Walker asked if a person who preferred the newspaper really read
the traditional printed newspaper or read it online. Pauletta Tonilas said that
newspaper articles and internet news were both included in the survey;
however, it really depends on how people answer. They could say the read
the newspaper when really they mean internet news. Director Walker stated
that he does not like the term “reduced congestion” because there are so
many things such as road projects, populations gain, etc. that create
congestion. He believes this term might be misleading to some. Todd
Pickton explained that the question was open-ended so people were not
forced into an answer; however, this meant that his team had to take the
800 responses and funnel them into what the response most represented.
He thinks it may be valuable for staff to look at the raw data. Director
Walker also asked for the percentage of completed surveys. Toss Pickton
stated that 12-15% of people contacted completed the survey. Pauletta
Tonilas shared that 800 respondents is the most we have ever had. Her
team is very happy about having 800 respondents. Director Walker noted
that surveys are very tricky; it is whoever answers the phone and is willing
to participate. He feels the results are decent but does not put a lot of stock
in it. Todd Pickton stated that there was some screening up-front to try to
balance the responses by gender, age, etc. and the results by demographics
mirror pretty closely to the demographics in the district.
Director Tobiassen asked if an electronic copy of the full report could be
provided to the Board. He also asked how staff uses the results to tweak
the Public Information programs and how they measure the success of those
tweaks. Pauletta Tonilas said she would send the full report to each
Director. She explained that staff may look at the survey by county to see
what is resonating in each area. It may be worthwhile for each project team
to push information in a different way or more frequently. Staff may try to
create a central core message that is a short, sweet and resonating
message.

demographic of the respondents. Todd Pickton explained that BBC worked
very hard to get a demographically represented sample by age, gender, etc.
but it did skew slightly older. He is working to break down the preferred
methods of communication by age and that will be reflected in the full
report.

Committee Chair Hoy stated that was a fascinating presentation. He
believes that as Director Tobiassen commented, there will be some
interesting things we can unveil as we dig into the data.

D. Other Matters

Director Solano attended the prairie dog meeting at the Arapahoe County
Fairgrounds. He shared that this was a very contentious meeting; it was interesting
to see how the environmentalists, ranchers and farmers interacted with each other.
Director Solano feels that despite this issue we need to get the rail done; we will
try to mitigate any issues with the prairie dogs but that cannot stop us from getting
the rail finished.

Director Deadwyler shared that she attended the E-470 Board meeting last week in
Director Tobiassen’s place. She found it to be a very interesting meeting. She
learned that many of the accidents on E-470 were with objects other than another
vehicle. In these cases if you slide of the road and hit a fence or sign you are
responsible for the damage.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP).
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the
motion to move the 2014-2019
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) to the
full Board for adoption.
Director Anderson seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino explained that the development of the SBP
has been discussed in several committee meetings beginning
in March of 2013. Two previous drafts were presented with
their initial and early assumptions. They have been able to
sharpen the estimates after gathering more information. They
are now recommending approval of a final SBP. Jannette
Scarpino reiterated that this is a balanced SPB; balanced
means there is a positive unrestricted year end fund balance
over the 6-year period. Staff has incorporated the CU Leeds
sales tax forecast updated in June. The revised growth
projection for 2013 is 3.7%, which is up from 2.5% in the
March forecast.
Jannette Scarpino reviewed Exhibit 1 (available online as page
7 in the Agenda Packet). She stated there are no service
reductions being proposed in the SBP. She explained staff is

6.C

Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that she spoke about
project requests in previous meetings and the project requests
have been reduced, eliminated or deferred to the tune of about
$185 million, which has helped balance the SBP. The deferred
projects which they would like to bring back into the SBP at
some point now total $13.7 million. A list of deferred projects
is contained in Exhibit 4 which is available in the Board office
for review. A list of planned projects is shown in Exhibits 2
and 3 (also in the Board office).
Jannette Scarpino stated that the Board-appropriated fund and
the capital replacement fund are funded at the minimum of $3
million per year, to a target of $30 million for each fund. This
is per policy and provides a basis for fiscal sustainability. She
said the target balances are reached no later than 2019. Also
in 2019, the unrestricted year end fund balance is projected to
reach $95.1 million. There will be factors outside of staff
control, such as sales tax revenue, fuel, cost of materials,
inflation, economic conditions, etc., which will impact the
SBP, but they will attempt to address those factors in
developing the 2014 budget.
Director Folska requested to be able to review Exhibits 2, 3
and 4 mentioned in the presentation just given when she was
reviewing the entire Board packet. She also asked whether
this would be the right time to ask about the Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP). Jannette Scarpino assured
Director Folska she would investigate the possibility of
providing a link to the Exhibits. GM Washington stated that Bill
Van Meter would address the TIP later.
Director Deadwyler inquired about the fare decreases and
increases she heard mentioned in the report. GM Washington
explained that there would be a fare revenue decrease, not a
fare decrease, in relation to the 2% in 2014. Jannette
Scarpino further elaborated the 2% fare revenue decrease
would occur in 2014 as a result of the West line coming on
and “cannibalizing” fare revenue that otherwise would have
gone to Bus. The fare revenue will still be collected but will be
reported in FasTracks operations, which is the West line. Then
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

showing a fare revenue decrease of 2% in 2014 but this is
really just a transfer of base operations revenue to the West
line. The SBP show a fare revenue to increase 10% every
third year per Board policy.

6.C

Director Walker commented that we will be bringing a few
other rail lines on board in 2016 and 2017 but he doesn’t see
a fare revenue decrease in 2017. He wonders if it is too far
out to estimate. Jannette Scarpino said this is a good point; it
is difficult to estimate right now, so they have opted to not
include it in the SBP. By that time, largely due to sales tax
increase, staff will be able to generate substantially more
unrestricted fund balances in those years, so there is a
cushion.

C. Updates

• May 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, provided the Board with a
status report. RTD ridership is up 4.7%, or 398,000 riders; this is mainly
due to the 373,000 additional riders we gained with the West line. For the
year we are still down 1.2%, or 515,000 riders. That is actually an
improvement over April. With the additional ridership that we got from the
West line May actually wash with the extra day that we had in 2012; we
are basically flat to 2012. He pointed out that in the ridership section, staff
has added a line (the second line down) for the West line and will be report
that separately because it is FasTracks operations. At this time ridership is
about where we expected it be at about 13,000 on a weekday. Doug
MacLeod believes that should ramp up to about 18,000 eventually.

Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

in 2015 and 2017, they are programming in a fare increase of
10%, per Board policy. The Board has the opportunity to
consider a fare increase every 3 years. GM Washington stated
that 2015 will be the year in which the Board will consider a
fare increase, per Board policy. Director Deadwyler
commented that this explanation is very helpful. She has been
approached by many transit-dependent citizens concerned
about fare increases. She thanked Jannette Scarpino and GM
Washington for the clarification.

6.C

Doug MacLeod explained that the Sales and Use Tax numbers reported were
an estimate; he informed the Board he left a copy of the revised/actual sales
tax numbers at each Director’s place at the table. For the month of May, we
were actually up 6.3% compared to May 2012, so that was additional
$2,385,000 this May. Year-to-date we are up 2.3%. In April, we were down
eight-tenths of a percent, so that’s a big swing the other way. The main
contributors to that increase in May came from a few different industries
including new and used car sales, home improvement centers, liquor stores’
sales, and computer manufacturing.
Doug MacLeod stated that page 17 of the Agenda Packet shows RTD’s
operating results for the West line for the month of May in addition to the
start-up costs for the year-to-date. He explained that staff is tracking the
cost of FasTracks operations with an allocation cost model; the reason staff
uses this model is because they cannot separate out all the West line
specific costs from the costs for the rest of the system. Each one of those
costs has been allocated to the West line on an activity-based approach; for
instance, they would allocate maintenance costs on track miles or revenue
hours. He stated that staff will follow this methodology throughout the year
and then true it up. He does not anticipate any big adjustments. Doug
MacLeod pointed out that the year-to-date column includes both start-up
expenses through April and operating expenses; going forward, it will only
be operating expenses.
Director Folska thanked Doug MacLeod for the update and requested
clarification on whether a rail line continues to be in FasTracks once it has
been opened or if it gets moved into our base system operating budget.
Doug MacLeod replied that we have to keep the six-tenths sales tax
separate from the four-tenths sales tax for FasTracks so the West line
becomes part of FasTracks operations; FasTracks operations is separate
from FasTracks capital programs. Director Folska asked whether the
FasTracks operations accounts for 5% or 20% of the bus fare revenue.
Doug MacLeod responded that when staff sets the budget for FasTracks
operations versus base system operations, they look at certain costs that
cannot be separated out; for instance, maintenance costs. There is not a
separate maintenance support function for the FasTracks operations so staff
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Doug MacLeod stated that fare revenue is up 10.7%, or $1,044,000, for
the month of May over May 2012. Year-to-date through May of 2013 we
are up $1,854,000, or 3.9%. He explained that the revenue from RTD’s fare
boxes was actually down half a percent, or $13,000 but the overall increase
is coming from our passes -- EcoPasses, CollegePasses, monthly passes and
annual passes. These increases are due to the federal workers shifting over
to flex-pass and out of the discounted EcoPass, as well as annual increases
that we have in contracts for the CollegePasses and EcoPasses.

6.C

looks at the individual item and determines how much will be used by
FasTracks and the rest stays on the base system side. Director Folska
thanked Doug MacLeod for the clarification.

Director Sisk commented that there doesn’t seem to be an allocation for
general counsel and safety and security. He asked if those allocations would
always be zero. Doug MacLeod replied that there is actually an allocation
for safety and security, but he understands Director Sisk’s point that there
are some zeroes. He explained that their cost allocation model has been used
for a long time. It was used in the past for our national transit database
report to the federal government and also to do our internal allocation to the
FasTracks operations. When it comes to some support costs like legal
counsel, RTD would have those costs whether or not the West line existed.
Marla Lien added that when the FasTracks capital program was developed, a
staffing plan was put together with all the staff necessary to implement the
program that are paid out of the FasTracks capital budget. She said that we
have not yet made an assessment of the staff allocation and the way we do
the budget but we could in the near future now that we have FasTracks
operations. Director Sisk believes that would be good. GM Washington
stated that one of the things to think about as well is that a lot of the
positions that we brought on which are funded by FasTracks capital budget
are project positions as well. He stated that some of those positions will
theoretically go away when the capital portion is complete.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• BroncosRide 2013 Update
Bruce Abel explained as we move towards the beginning of Broncos season
staff reviews our special service plan for the BroncosRide. This year there
are several adjustments, given the West Line opening. He shared that while
we eventually anticipate that the Broncos Ride service from stations served
by the W Line will be replaced by trains, at this time we are keeping the
service from the Federal Center Station. Bruce Abel also explained that we
would be making changes to the Federal Shuttle. For the 2013 Broncos
season the north portion of the shuttle will not operate as the owner for
RTD’s BroncosRide parking location has decided not to continue our
arrangement.
Director Folska asked for an explanation as to why we have a BroncosRide
shuttle but other sporting events, celebrity golf tournaments, etc. do not
have a RTD sponsored service. She also wondered about light rail frequency
and number of cars per train when there are special events. She hears many
complaints from her constituents that RTD does not have adequate light rail
service during these times. Bruce Abel explained that we are bound by
Federal Transportation Authority guidelines on offering charter service;
federally funded transit agencies should not provide service to special events
that occur on a limited basis and would be served by private charter
companies. He said that there are exceptions for routinely scheduled special
events like the routinely reoccurring Broncos games. We communicate our
services to the public and the fares match our fares for other service (i.e.

Packet Pg. 24

Directors Deadwyler and Menten arrived late.

6.D

BroncosRide from a regional Park-n-Ride would be a regional fare;
BroncosRide from a local Park-n-Ride would be a local fare, etc.) Bruce Abel
stated that we also do a service for weekend Rockies games. He shared
that the reason we have those two services is they meet the service
standards; Rockies weekday games do not meet the threshold. Bruce Abel
and Austin Jenkins explained that staff looks closely at special events and
works with Visit Denver to try to accommodate the number of riders with
the appropriate number of light rail cars; however, this is always a work in
progress.

Judy McMurphy shared that the team from the Smart Media Technology
program is going to be focusing on testing over the next few weeks. This
will include testing the handheld Smart Media reader for fare inspectors, the
retail point-of-sales (RPOS) machines, as well as our external web portal.
She said that she will be able to report the results of the tests at the next
Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting.
Bruce Abel stressed that the outcome of these tests is very much going to
determine staff’s ability to maintain the timeline that has been
communicated to the Board previously. He wants to make sure all Directors
understand that.
Director Folska asked if one of the RPOS machines had been brought to the
Blake facility and if not, was it possible to bring one for a demonstration.
She also asked if we would be testing the machines with people with a
variety of disabilities. Beverly Scott stated that one had not been brought to
Blake but it would be possible. She explained that the RPOS machines are
the point-of-sales machines that will be used by our Smart Card partners,
not by customers; however, the web portal will be used by our customers
and staff is working with one of our vendors to ensure ADA compliance.
Director Hoy asked for clarification on our situation with 7-Eleven. He is
wondering if ‘no response’ means 7-Eleven indicated they did not want to
participate or they just did not respond at all. Beverly Scott said that 7Eleven did not respond to RTD at all. They have a very specific process that
we followed but they have not responded.
Director Hoy asked if staff has sorted out the issue of the CollegePasses and
summer school or whether we have a plan to address the issue. Bruce Abel
said they not only have a plan but a process is in place. He explained there
were two elements related to this issue. The first is that we did not receive
the software from our supplier until later in the game than we had
anticipated. The second issue is that when we went to use the software to

Packet Pg. 25

• Smart Card Project Status Update

6.D

Director Deadwyler asked for more information about the issues we are
experiencing with the APOS printers. She understands they are under
warranty but wonders when staff expects the issues to be resolved. She
also asked if we have any printers that can do the job. July McMurphy
stated that there is one printer at the Blake office that is having issues. The
printer is printing the picture as a black square on the card. She said staff is
working with the vendor to determine the root cause so it may be resolved.
Judy McMurphy stated that there is a printer at the RTD call center that is
currently meeting our supply needs.

• Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Eric Farrington informed the Board that due to continued issues with the
system we have asked the vendor to send a Senior Central System Engineer
(SCSR). He will be arriving from Germany tomorrow.
Director Deadwyler asked how long we anticipated he would stay to monitor
the system and whether RTD is paying him. Eric Farrington stated that RTD
is not paying him. At this time we have not accepted the system so INIT is
sending him here. Eric Farrington has met the engineer in the past; he has a
great deal of skill and understands multiple modules within the system. Eric
Farrington feels that within a few weeks the system should be running
smoothly.
Director Folska asked for clarification as to what Eric Farrington meant when
he said we have not accepted the system. Eric Farrington explained that
this is our radio and computer aided dispatch and automatic vehicle location
system. This is what dispatchers use to track buses, manage on-time
performance, monitor vehicle health, make automatic stop announcements,
etc. The cost of this system is $37 million. Eric Farrington stated that we
have installed it on approximately 90% of our buses and our entire light rail
vehicles. He said that we have been testing it for a while because it is not
working how we think it should. Bruce Abel explained that with every IT
project the vendor has to pass certain tests and milestones before we accept
it. Director Folska asked when staff expects the next stop announcement to
be functioning on all of our vehicles. Eric Farrington stated that would be in
September.
Director Bagley stated that installation has been going on for about two and
a half years. He asked what our original schedule was for completion and

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

implement a process of suspending the cards, we learned that the
universities had not been following the administrative process they had been
instructed to follow so that we could use the suspend feature.

6.D

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked what our plan B is if the engineer is not able
to get the system working properly. Eric Farrington stated that he is
confident the engineer will be able to fix the system. It is an issue of
system slowness. The vendor is able to repeatedly fix the issue but then it
begins to run slowly again. Eric Farrington said that when there are issues
we are able to run the system in a fall back mode and after working with the
databases it is fully functional within hours. General Manager Washington
explained that if the system is slow and we go into fall back mode the buses
are not going to stop running; we just fall back into a basic radio mode but
we can still communicate with our drivers. Trent Ratcliff informed the Board
that the warranty period does not begin until we have accepted the system.
Director Menten asked if this new system was due to a new regulation
created by the FCC. Eric Farrington explained that the FCC has changed the
regulations regarding the bandwidth of radios and our old radios were not in
compliance. The ruling on the regulation was made about 20 years ago but
the implementation deadline was December 31, 2012. General Manager
Washington stated we received a waiver since we have been working on
implementation.
Director Lubow noted that we have had many problems over the last several
years. She is concerned that the vendor may fix the issues for right now
but they will come up again in the future. Eric Farrington stated that we do
have a 6 year warranty so the vendor will be on the hook to make sure they
fix anything that goes wrong during that time. General Manager Washington
stated that we are dealing with a very complex system but that is why there
are milestones and acceptance testing. He said staff is confident the system
will work and if not, the vendor will be held accountable.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley asked staff to provide the Board with an update on the attacks at
the Lamar and Nine Mile stations. General Manager Washington said he would get
the Board additional information.

Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

how long this process has taken at other transit agencies. Eric Farrington
said that staff originally planned for a two year installation time-frame. He
explained that the length of time to install the system on each vehicle was
substantially longer than expected. It was projected to take 8 hours and is
actually taking 14-18. He expected that installations should be complete
toward the end of August or beginning of September. Eric Farrington shared
that no transit agency in the United States has completed one of these
projects in less than 3 years; he has talked to one agency that took more
than 12 years.

6.D

Director Menten asked when the Board would be receiving information on route
performance. Bruce Abel said there is a Study Session scheduled for July that will
have a presentation from Bus Operations. He also expects that the Finance
Department will present additional information in the September/October range.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors
review and approve the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the
future monitoring on an annual basis,
to comply with federal laws,
regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion
to move this item to the full Board at the
July 16, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Michael Washington reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with
the Board that is available in the July 9, 2013 Civil Rights
Committee Agenda Packet.
General Manager Washington stated that as Michael
Washington explained, we are required to take a sample of
both minority and non-minority areas for a comparative
analysis. He said that there are some improvements needed
but we are making those improvements along the way.
Director Bagley asked Michael Washington to expound on
what he means by transit amenities. He also asked if the
definition of transit amenities includes sidewalks/access to the
bus stations which is the responsibility of the local
governments or municipalities. Michael Washington explained
that the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) defines
transit amenities as (a) seating (i.e. benches, seats at

Director Folska thanked Michael Washington for his
presentation. She thought it was very informative. Director
Folska noted that people with disabilities are not one of the
categories of people listed as covered by Title VI. She asked if
this means we are not required to provide accessible signage
or sidewalks so that people can actually get on the buses.
She stated that this is an issue in Director Solano’s District
because there are not sidewalks so people in wheelchairs
cannot get to the buses. Michael Washington explained that
people with disabilities are not included under Title VI.
Director Folska asked for further information regarding the
discussion about installing a streetcar along 29th and Welton
as well as the Colfax corridor. She has heard discussion that
the people at 29th and Welton want to remove the existing
light rail through that area. She also asked how much RTD is
paying for these various studies. Director Folska expressed
that she feels very sad that RTD paid to put in a train and now
we are paying for a study to look at ripping it out. General
Manager Washington stated that both of those studies are
ongoing. Bill Van Meter explained that we have just selected a
consultant to evaluate the Welton corridor. One of the
alternatives that could be considered as part of the study is
removing the light rail to build a streetcar or it simply could be
an extension of the current rail. He stated that as it relates to
the Colfax studies staff will be bringing a full report to the
Board at an upcoming P&D meeting; there is one study run by
RTD to look at near-term improvements and one by the City
and County of Denver to evaluate long-term feasibility. Bill
Van Meter said he would get back to the Board with the cost
of the studies. General Manager Washington stated that there
are multiple scopes related to the Welton corridor study;
however, the bulk of the scope is to talk about how we get
operationally from the East line all the way Downtown. He
said that the streetcar is an ancillary part of the study.
General Manager Washington explained that there are different
Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

stops/stations), (b) bus and rail shelters and rail platform
canopies, (c) provision of information: i. printed signs, system
maps, route maps, and schedules and ii. Digital equipment
such as next vehicle arrival time signs, (d) escalators, (e)
elevators, and (f) waste receptacles. He stated that sidewalks
are not included for the reason Director Bagley stated; the FTA
acknowledges that transit agencies do not have control over
the sidewalks.

6.E

Director James commented that the goal of the sample and
comparison was to determine if there were disadvantages to
minorities in the system. He found no conclusion one way or
another so he was wondering if that meant that no
disadvantages were discovered. He asked if staff had the
maps from the presentation available for the entire district.
Director James also asked what the sample size was for the
comparison. Michael Washington explained that in reviewing
transit amenities staff did see communities that did not have
the appropriate amount; due to this finding staff is reviewing
our policy related to transit amenities. Bruce Abel explained
that staff uses these maps as part of the service planning
process but they do not maintain them for the entire district.
General Manager Washington said that staff would see what
they can do to get Director James a similar map for his
District. Michael Washington stated that staff sampled 30
census tracts out of the 200 we have in the District.
Director Lubow thought that within Title VI there was
protection against negative impacts to people of low income
but she did not see anything related to that in the
presentation. Michael Washington explained that the only
place we look at people of low income is during the
Environmental Justice process.
Director Solano noted that a lot of areas in Commerce City do
not have sidewalks. Due to this, the quarter mile buffer is not
met and Commerce City has a high Hispanic population.
Michael Washington explained that we are limited on
sidewalks because we do not have jurisdiction over them. He
said that with respect to route distribution, staff did not see
any issues and we are meeting our service coverage
standards. He offered to sit down with Director Solano to
discuss his other concerns one-on-one.

factions in the community; some of the community wants the
connectivity spelled out in our original FasTracks plan while
others want a streetcar. Marla Lien explained that in the
original FasTracks plan an extension was approved. As part of
the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) we would need to
consider all mobility options. General Manager Washington
stated that any decision related to the Central corridor
extension would be subject to approval of the Board.

Director Walker asked if the highlights covered under service
monitoring are specific to minority areas or the system in
general. He also asked how we work with local jurisdictions
and constituents when it comes to building and maintaining
shelters. Michael Washington stated that the highlights were
specific to the sample in general. He explained that the issue
of shelters is a complicated issue. RTD works very closely
with the property owners, municipalities, etc. to determine
where we can place amenities. He noted that we have many
bus stops that back up to private property so it can be difficult
to place shelters at these locations. Director Walker
commented that we might be able to identify ways to bring
equality but there could be other obstacles preventing us from
doing so.
Director James asked if we have a policy for determining
where we put a shelter. Michael Washington stated that we
do have a policy but it is outdated. It starts with an evaluation
of boardings at a particular stop but it does not adequately
accommodate all scenarios so staff is in the process of
updating the policy.
Chair Anderson commented that many cities make money off
the bus shelters. Bruce Abel stated that this is one of the
issues that has truly grown over the years. In the past RTD,
was solely responsible for providing shelters, but as
municipalities have seen this as a source of revenue they have
started to build them. He explained that we have no control
over the placement of the ad shelters, regardless of what our
policy might be. Bruce Abel shared that he actually received a
call from someone inquiring as to why there was a shelter at a
location with no bus service. He also stated that we get calls
from municipalities asking us to remove our shelters so they
may install the revenue shelters. Bruce Abel said this is why
we need to update our policy; we need to make sure we are
responding to what the communities are doing so we may
better use our resources.
Committee Chair Deadwyler stated that the Board just
approved a Title VI report not too long ago. She asked if we
are submitting these reports in sections or if this will be part of
the entire report that is submitted. Michael Washington
explained that this is just an element of the larger report that
RTD will submit.

D. Other Matters


General Manager Washington wanted to briefly discuss our field compliance
practices. He stated that there has been some discussion of former workers of
Rocky Mountain Reinforcement (RMR) coming to Board meetings. General
Manager Washington has asked Kenn Hardin and Rick Clarke to briefly review
what RTD looks at when we go out to the field to look at compliance. He
stated that staff will try to talk specifically about the RMR issues as much as
they can.
Kenn Hardin stated that the Civil Rights division is required to do oversight of
labor compliance of 3rd party contracts as part of Davis-Bacon. He explained
that our compliance officers go out on a weekly basis to each project and there
is always a bilingual Spanish speaking compliance officer available. The
compliance officers confidentially interview each worker, asking questions
related to wages, kind of work being performed, tools being used, fringe
benefits, etc. They also take photographs of what the workers are doing so
they can compare these with what is actually being reported. Kenn Hardin
shared that after they conduct the field interviews/research, the officers review
the certified payrolls submitted by all contractors on a weekly basis to verify
that what they were told in the interviews and observed in the field matches the
payroll and worker classification. He said that if there are any issues found a
report and letter are sent to the contractor explaining the issue and giving them
30 days to respond. As an example, this could be a misclassification of a
worker leading to an underpayment in which case the contractor would have 30
days to pay the employee restitution.
Kenn Hardin shared that to date his department has performed approximately
2,500 interviews out in the field. He explained that as it relates to RMR, our
compliance officers went into the field on the Eagle P3 project and witnessed
that there were employees of RMR who were performing iron work. When they
reviewed those payrolls it was discovered that they were being paid laborer
wages so that was a misclassification. He said that we notified RMR that those
employees should be paid iron worker wages in September of 2012. RMR had
paid restitution to the misclassified employees by October of 2012. Kenn
Hardin stated that in November of 2012 the Department of Labor went into the

C. Updates

6.E

General Manager Washington informed the Board that staff has had
conversations with the prime contractors on each project. Since RMR is a
subcontractor to certain prime contractors RTD does not have a direct
relationship with them. Rick Clarke stated that staff emphasized to our prime
contractors the concerns that were raised and that we expect them to be
vigilant in their requirements with subcontractors. He said that his team works
very closely with Kenn Hardin’s group and there is at least one compliance
officer for every project. He ensured the Board that between Kenn’s group and
his team there are a lot of people out there enforcing compliance with the
contractors. He feels the great safety record is one of the successes of
FasTracks.
Director Daly asked if any of our WIN participants were employed my RMR.
Kenn Hardin said that to our knowledge none were.
Director Folska asked if RMR is a DBE or SBE firm and who the prime contractor
is for each project. She also wondered if it was a normal course of business to
misclassify employees as frequently as RMR seems to do. Director Folska noted
that the former RMR workers who spoke to the Board also complained about
things like no restrooms, no water, etc. and asked if staff looked into those
things too. Kenn Hardin stated that for Eagle P3 the prime contractor is Denver
Transit Partners and for Denver Union Station it is Kiewit. He stated that it
does happen on occasion with various contractors. Rick Clarke shared that it
happens to prime contractors as well. Kenn Hardin explained that it is the
nature of the construction business. On occasion workers will be out in the
field and a contractor will ask a laborer to take a measurement. The minute this
occurs the laborer is crossing trades and is now a carpenter. Kenn Hardin said
that the compliance officers do look at things like safety, water, restrooms, etc.
and there have not been any issues during the course of staff being out in the
field. Rick Clarke shared that he was just at DUS. He saw that there were
water coolers throughout the site and restrooms were available. He believes if
there was a big problem we would notice it.
Director Lubow stated that we have had the former RMR workers address the
Board at Board meetings on several occasions and they have also come to the
Citizens Advisory Committee meetings. She is concerned when people are
raising these questions that we are evaluating them. We may go out into the
field and not see X, Y and Z happening but do we speak with the people that
allege it happened in the past. Mei-Ling Rodriguez, compliance officer for DUS,
explained that when compliance officers go out into the field and conduct
interviews there is an area for comments where workers can file a complaint or
ask a question. They will make a note of any complaints and go back to the
site to verify the situation. She stated that in the case of the former RMR
workers, these workers have approached the compliance officers on the street
and they have explained the process to the workers. The compliance team has

Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

field on the Eagle P3 site and found the same misclassification. RMR was
required to reclassify the workers and pay restitution and they did so. He said
that with regards to Denver Union Station, our compliance officer found the
same misclassification issue. RMR was notified of the misclassification and is in
the process of responding.

6.E

Director Lubow asked if staff has gone back to ensure that RMR is not falling
back into the same old habits and misclassifying workers. Mei-Ling Rodriguez
stated that the compliance officers do that on a weekly basis. They have
received positive feedback from other workers.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked how many individuals are hired by RMR. She
also wonders if the companies know the compliance officers are coming. MeiLing Rodriguez stated that she could not comment on employees of the
company as a whole but for DUS it was between 10-20 depending on the
week, season, etc. She said that all the visits are unannounced and all
interviews are confidential. Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if there is a
mechanism by which RMR is marked as being non-complaint in the past when
bidding for subcontracting jobs. General Manager Washington explained that
we cannot go out and place demerits on a sub-contractor when they have
responded to substantiated issues and other claims have not been
substantiated. Since the relationship exists between the prime contractor and
the subcontractor it is up to the prime if they want to continue to work with
that same sub.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked General Manager Washington for some specific
talking points related to this issue. She is concerned because these gentlemen
have been to Directors’ homes and workplaces. She thanked staff for all of
their input.
Director Walker expressed his understanding of the difficulties that go into
compliance. There are some employees that just give the answers you are
hoping to get and others that are disgruntled. He also understands the
difficulties in misclassification. It can be as simple as someone being absent
who knows how to run the backhoe and asking if anyone present does.
Director Solano expressed a concern with workers being reclassified as iron
workers. Normally there is extensive training, apprenticeship, etc. before an
iron worker performs welding activities. He inquired if there is any testing
process that occurs before we reclassify the workers to make sure they are
journeyman level workers. Rick Clarke stated that any welder must be certified
and is classified separately from iron workers. He said the real complication is
that the Department of Labor does not interpret the rules the same from year to
year. In the past the definition of an iron worker has not included setting rebar
but now it does. Zamy Silva explained that it is the responsibility of the
subcontractors to determine that all their workers are licensed.

Packet Pg. 36

offered to sit down with the workers to go over their pay stubs and discuss
their concerns. Mei-Ling Rodriguez stated that some former workers have done
this and some have not. The group that continues to contact the Board has
not. Kenn Hardin reiterated to the Board that on any one project we have
hundreds of companies in the field and we are hearing from a few workers with
a single company. He believes if this were an issue on a construction site we
would likely be hearing from more than just a few individuals from one
company. He asks the Board to consider this as they are listening to these
isolated issues.

6.E

Director Folska thinks that Director Rivera-Malpiede has some important ideas,
not so much in demerits but in reviewing the Certificate of Good Standing with
the Secretary of State, getting the Better Business Bureau rating for each
company, etc. She hopes we can take a deeper look at our policies to
determine if anything further can be incorporated.



Director Bagley had several questions that he did not get a chance to ask during
other committee meetings. He wanted to bring them up so staff has the
opportunity to respond.
1) He noted a mention of CU Leeds making an update to the Sales and Use Tax
forecasts in June. He asked if CU Leeds could make a presentation to the
Board to explain why they made the changes.
2) Director Bagley noted the three major successes that came out of the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force (sales tax parity, auditing, and parking legislation).
He feels it is valuable to re-energize that Task Force and begin to have
additional meetings.
3) Director Bagley asked for an update on Alameda Station.

General Manager Washington expressed that he knows how the Board feels.
Directors have had people come to their houses, places of work, Board
meetings, etc. and everyone wants to fix this. He asked the Board to keep in
mind that RTD staff are the ones that found the issue in the first place and RMR
corrected it. He said that staff will continue to monitor all the contractors and
will keep the Board posted.

Other Matters


General Manager Washington stated that in the North Metro Quarterly meeting this
morning, he had announced the date for the opening of the bus terminal at DUS to be
May 9, 2014 which is ahead of the anticipated schedule in the original FasTracks plan.
They had stood up an activation committee approximately 12 months ago whose
function is to determine readiness to open. They are coordinating with DUSPA and the
USA for the historic building hotel and retail center. They will make an announcement
today which will include quotes from Walter Isenberg on their plans to open the hotel
and retail in late July. A heads-up has been given to the stakeholders (i.e. DUSPA,
City of Denver, Tami Door-Downtown Denver and CDOT).

Director Daly inquired about the closure of Market Street Station. General Manager
Washington indicated the closure will coordinate to the run date of May 10, Sunday
morning when the switch gets flipped.

Director Bagley inquired how far ahead of schedule were we? General Manager
Washington indicated about 4-5 months but did provide a qualifier around this
statement. Director Bagley responded it is very important that the riders of the SE/SW
lines understand they will have new alternatives for getting to DUS and the airport. We
need to notify these riders of light rail C&E and the ability to get to the airport a
different way. Some of his constituents have expressed concern over the loss of
Skyride service from southwest.


General Manager Washington indicated that Leadership APTA will meet in Denver next
week. Jenny Barket, legal, is our representative in this program. RTD will serve as
host and the staff will be presenting in a number of sessions. The Board has been
invited to attend some of the sessions on Wednesday, July 17th.



On September 5, Denver will host the Western CEO Roundtable. This consists of
CEOs/GMs from transit properties in the west (i.e. Dallas, SLC, Phoenix and Seattle).



Next week the Multi-Agency Exchange program (MAX) will have their graduation in
Denver. The MAX program currently has representatives from three transit properties
doing knowledge sharing and exchange. Some of the GMs from the Western CEO
Roundtable will be participating in the graduation ceremonies.



The COMTO Colorado organization will host its annual golf tournament next week.
Monies raised from this event goes toward the scholarships that are given to students
with interest in transit or transportation.



General Manager Washington indicated he had met with Don Hunt of CDOT. They are
gearing up for Impact 64, the statewide sales tax initiative for 2014. CDOT has the
lead on this and RTD will simply march in step with CDOT.

Chair Anderson pointed out how important it will be to communicate to the people
from the West corridor and the North on options to access the AF Skyride from DUS to
DIA. This opens up new options for them. General Manager Washington added there
are many other aspects to this opening to be worked out such as the straightening out
of the street and signaling on Market Street.

He requested the process or mechanism we are using to provide support to former
Director Cohen during his illness.
He indicated he will provide slides from Tom Clark’s presentation that shows
projected growth and population changes over the next few years by quadrants.
He thinks this is beneficial information for the people engaged in the Northwest
Mobility study.
The South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce hosted an executive meeting on
infrastructure issues. He would like to consider hosting the next session on
Infrastructure II at RTD. This is a great chance for RTD to get hooked into the
discussions. He will explore this opportunity for late fall or early spring.
He would like to follow-up on a conversation he had with the AGM for capital
programs related to SW corridor small group meeting with stakeholders.
On a return trip from the Mountains (Aspen area), he had a chance to observe the
RAFTA (BRT) in that area. The system operated smoothly with the busses
whizzing past while the rest of the traffic remained bogged down.



Director Walker apologized for arriving late due to work commitments.



Chair Anderson indicated that RTD had participated with the City of Arvada in a
selection of a developer for Olde Town. She attended a meeting where the focus was
on the partnership between RTD and the City of Arvada for Olde Town. The City of
Arvada is very pleased with this relationship. RTD is well thought of in the City of
Arvada.



Director Hoy commented about the North Metro Quarterly meeting that was held this
morning. There were 30+ people in attendance. He can see a change in attitude and
a spirit of cooperation. They are very committed to getting this thing done. It was a
good and valuable meeting. The stakeholders appreciated the information provided by
RTD.



Director Daly commented on the letter sent to General Manager Washington from a
stranger who had come into town and been assisted by the General Manager. He
asked the General Manager what may have been confusing-perhaps a lack of signage.
General Manager noted he does not think anything was missing but sometimes as a
new person in town, one can become discombobulated. This is the kind of help that
our employees give to people every day.

Director Walker asked the General Manager if he knew Anthony Graves who was
announced by Mayor Hancock as Director of Regional Affairs. General Manager
Washington indicated he is familiar and may try to introduce him to the Board. We
believe he will replace Paul Ryan.



Director Hoy shared that in a communications with Mayor Heidi Williams about paying
for parking for park-n-rides, there does not appear to be signage letting them know that
they can park free for 24 hours if they are in the district. He believes we need to
communicate this in a more visible way.

Public Participation
Chair Anderson shared that we had planned to have a special performance by the Sound
Wave Signing Choir, a nonprofit youth group that works with people with hearing
disabilities. They had a last minute change.
Bruce Benson, President of the University of Colorado (CU), spoke in favor of the I-225
alignment change. He stated this change is critical to the future of the Anschutz campus
which includes the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority, the Children’s Hospital and the
University of Colorado Hospital. Mr. Benson stated he understands RTD’s concern about
not wanting to provide additional monies to fund this alignment change. He stated that
CU is committed to providing shuttle service on the campus and RTD will not have to
spend over and beyond what has already been budgeted on the I-225 project. Mr.
Benson provided talking points and a letter which was sent to the campus leadership
outlining the need for change. A copy of those two letters can be found in the Board
office file for the June 25, 2013 Board meeting.
Honorable Mayor Steve Hogan of Aurora also stated the City’s support for the I-225
alignment change. He shared this was a difficult decision with lots of questions but not
necessarily all of the answers. The City and RTD have evaluated this request and are in
support of this change. The City of Aurora is committed to working with the RTD staff to
make sure these changes bring about operational improvements. We believe it will allow

John Torres, representing the Golden West Retirement Community in Boulder, spoke about
the negative effect that changing the 209G route near the center will have on the senior
citizens. The average age of the residents is 84 and they are no longer able to drive. He
explained that the impact of the change in route to them will leave the seniors without
transportation options. He stated he had a petition from 151 residents. He also stated he
had asked how many of them were users of public transit and approximately 40 people
indicated they use the service.
Joseph Stukes spoke about the Fitzsimons alignment change proposal. He stated some of
the information about the impact of EMI is overrated at best and that there are other
variables such as buildings with solar panels, etc., which can create interference. He
raised the question if the equipment is so sensitive, the noise levels from planes, etc.
should create interference. He talked about the DC levels and how this works. He
believes not all cards have been laid on the table.
Tom Grushka, RTD Watch, posed a number of questions to Chair Anderson around
decisions that have been made. He stated the Board needs to learn how to respect people,
the public and people with disabilities. He believes his name has been tarnished and he
expects more respect from the Board.
Ricky Martinez, Rocky Mountain Reinforcement (RMR), shared his experiences in working
for RMR. He talked about concerns over workers’ safety and stated that he wants to see
the RTD lines where RMR is a subcontractor be built with fairness for the workers.
Nghia Nguien from Commerce City asked for help from RTD where he believes RMR has
consistently violated the laws. We keep “passing the buck”. Even as RMR worked on the
DUS project, they had to pay restitution because of prevailing wages; they were awarded
a $10M contract on Eagle P-3. RTD did some limited compliance checking; the Federal
Department of Labor also did some compliance checking and determined that RMR needed
to pay each worker an additional $1400. He has a concern for the I-225 project as well.
RTD cannot continue to take a hands-off approach. RTD needs to operate with integrity
and do the right thing.
Jim Toweill, with the ironworkers of Commerce City, also spoke on the issue of RMR.
RTD has heard but not acted on the concerns. This is actually RTD’s problem. The
problem is not going away. He hopes that RTD will begin addressing these issues.

the system to run at higher speeds along Colfax to Peoria; this will also allow better
management of the construction traffic, as the City cannot absorb having simultaneous
construction for street and light rail maintenance.

8.A

Louis Apolinar, RMR, shared what it was like to work for RMR. They did not provide
water for the workers; they did not pay prevailing wages; they verbally abused the
workers.
Chair Anderson requested General Manager Washington to provide an update to the Board
on this issue.
Doug Grass who lives in Director James’ District expressed that he listens to the media
and does not share their perspective about RTD.
Zoe Williams with the 9 to 5 organization, shared that they work with women in low
paying jobs. They have been engaged with the community along the 16L route to
understand their challenges of getting to work, school, childcare, etc. She has worked
with Directors Rivera-Malpiede and Menten and appreciates all the hard work that has
gone into coming up with a solution. She thanked the service team staff, especially Rob
Rynerson, Jessie Carter and Bruce Abel. She appreciates the collaboration and believes
they have come up with a solution that is workable for this community.
Isatu Friedman spoke about the challenges of getting to work since the 16L was removed.

Francisco Nunez with the Ironworkers shared his concerns and frustration in working with
RMR. It was very difficult work; the job was dangerous; the company did not worry about
safety or fairness to the employees. He is asking RTD to listen to the workers so their
voices can be heard.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Director Kent Bagley, Chair of the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee
provided this update. The committee had met last Tuesday, June 18, 2013 to discuss the
4 key items for focus that came from the1Q’2013 GM survey comments. The committee
members are Directors Bagley, Daly, Lasater, Rivera-Malpiede, Solano and Tobiassen.
Other Board members in attendance included Directors Deadwyler, Folska, Lubow, Hoy
and Chair Anderson. This was a very robust discussion. They also started the discussion
on the 5 strategic goals from the March 2 strategic planning session that will be part of
the General Manager’s tactical plans. Lots of questions and comments were provided.
The next step will be a committee meeting on July 9 at 3:30 p.m. The strategic goals
drive the 2014 budget and the GM will take his tactical plans to implement the goals and
transfer them to the performance review form that is used by the rest of the agency.
These goals become his task goals for 2014. Some of the input provided by Board
members will be reviewed to see if it can be incorporated into the task or core goals. If
there is any budgetary impact, it will be brought back to the full Board for consideration.
The GM 2014 goals will be approved by the full Board at the July 16, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Bagley thanked all of the Board members who participated in this discussion.

Chair's Report
Chair Anderson shared that she and Director Rivera-Malpiede had attended the APTA Rail
conference, where she participated in a discussion on elected boards versus appointed
boards. There are only three elected boards in the country.
Chair Anderson shared that on June 5, Director Hoy represented the Board at the North
Metro golf outing.
Chair Anderson shared that in May & June, RTD celebrated Accident Free Days. Safety is
the number one priority for RTD and as stated by General Manager Washington, it is a
good day when we can transport our customers safely to and from their destination.
Three Board members, Directors Folska, Rivera-Malpiede and Tobiassen attended the
Armed Services Luncheon.
On June 19, we had our first town hall meeting on the Northwest Mobility Study. We
reached out to over 48,000 people with response from 5,300. However, due to an error
in transposing the call-in number, some of the key people were not able to dial in. We
have scheduled another town hall for Thursday, June 27 to hopefully capture some of
these people.
Director Deadwyler, along with our public information staff manned a RTD booth at the
Juneteenth festival. Approximately 300 people visited the booth.
Director Walker and eight of the CDOT Commissioners took a tour of Denver Union
Station. This was a great tour and the Commissioners were amazed at the transformation
that is taking place around the Denver Union Station.
Director Lasater will host a town hall meeting in Parker on June 26 to provide an update
on RTD.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington reported that he had participated in the Transportation
Research Board (TRB) and the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Oversight and
Project Section (TOPS) Committees from June 20-22, 2013. The TRB is a national
organization of scientists engaged in various research topics. This was a very productive
meeting. One of the items they looked at was fuel and fuel alternatives. TOPS select
projects which will be researched. GM Washington sits on the TRB Executive Committee.

On Wednesday, June 26, RTD will have a day-long FTA quarterly review. They will go
through everything on items or contracts that have federal funds.
On June 27, 2013, the General Manager will host his annual RTD Employee Awards
Recognition event. This is an event where we recognize employees for their achievements
and contribution either individually or as a team. RTD is honored to have such a high
performance group of employees. This is another aspect of how we invest in human
capital.
The FTA final drug and alcohol audit report for RTD went well and no deficiencies were
found.
Staff plans to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) for North Metro on June 28. They
are hoping for a NTP before the end of the year. The SBE/DBE office had a special
meeting yesterday where they sought input and suggestions from the SBE community.
This was well attended.
As stated by the Chair, we had the first town hall meeting on Wednesday, June 19 for the
Northwest Mobility Study. Unfortunately, we had a problem with the call-in number so we
have scheduled another one for this Thursday. We are moving forward on this study and
we are interested in hearing from our public about this issue.
Before we open up any rail line, we stand up our activation team about 2 years out. We
hope in the next couple of weeks to tell the Board about our projected opening date for
DUS.
Director Rivera-Malpiede commented on the DBEAC meeting for SBEs that was referenced
earlier. She stated it was well-attended and had good participation and good questions
and comments. We had a cross-representation of the community. She thinks Helga
Grunerad is doing a good job as co-chair of DBEAC.
Director Menten inquired for more information concerning RMR. She would like
information on the restitutions that were discussed during public participation.

Chair Anderson opened up the public hearing on the 2013 amended budget at 6:35 p.m.
After reading the script, she asked if there was anyone in the audience who would like to
speak directly to the 2013 amended budget.
Tom Grushka stated that he has a concern that previous budgets have allowed funds for
staff and Board members to travel to conferences and conduct the strategic planning
retreat that they held in March. He thinks this is a poor use of taxpayers’ funds and no
more trips should be taken from this budget. He also thinks this should be an itemized
item on the budget.
Chair Anderson closed the public hearing portion of the meeting at 6:40 p.m. and called
for a motion to approve the 2013 amended budget.

Director Folska made the motion to approve the

Recommended Action
E.

Approval of I-225 Alignment Changes

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
approve a change in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor. This change
would move the alignment along Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical
Campus to a new alignment in the general vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway. The station
location will also change from Montview to along Fitzsimons Parkway. The exact location
will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of
Colorado stakeholders as well as public input, and also to include a transportation plan
that will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the
Anschutz Campus. A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.
All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 Project budget.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the I225 alignment changes.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

General Manager Washington outlined some of the
elements of concern for the proposed I-225 alignment:
1) Shuttle—He referred to the comments (and talking
points) from CU President Benson regarding CU’s
commitment to create and fund a shuttle for the
Anschutz campus.

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 25, 2013 7:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of June 25, 2013)

C.

2) Execute within I-225 budget—General Manager
stated they have put the item to not exceed the I225 budget into the Recommended Action. He
feels the RTD track record should speak for itself in
terms of bringing in projects on time and within
budget. He asked the Board to trust staff in this
delivery.
3) Environmental re-evaluation—Staff has provided a
statement to the Board which outlines their plan to
perform a re-evaluation. This has identified
timelines to perform this work.
4) Effect on wildlife—This question was asked and
they have responded this will not have an effect on
wildlife.
5) What did CU know regarding EMI—As CU President
Benson noted, they had some previous discussions
about EMI but this unsolicited proposal came sooner
than they had expected and the aggressive posture
of RTD took them by surprise.
6) Reconstruction of Montview—The first bullet by CU
President Benson indicated they do not have
funding to reconstruct Montview.
7) The Mayor of Aurora indicated there are some
operational benefits in moving this alignment.
8) Mitigation will create delay—Staff estimates for
every month of delay, there is an associated $1.52M loss.
Staff has provided their recommendation to change this
alignment and continue the momentum that has been
started on the FasTracks program. A no vote on this
issue will stalemate progress.
Director Hoy stated he is as excited as everyone else
about this project. We are building trains. He recalls a
few short months ago when CU President Benson
stood before the Board and encouraged the building of
trains. This happened in August and here we are being
asked to make a significant change and no one can tell
us the cost. We only have a promise it will not exceed
our budget. He would like the Board to consider

Director Solano commented we were changing horses
in the middle of the stream. He wants his corridor
finalized. We should have seen these issues before
now. We should not be putting the cart before the
horse. He will support the motion.
Director Lasater stated that in his 17+ years as an
elected official, he has never seen such turbulence as
was created by this last minute change. There is a lot
of analyzing and missing information. In the words of
an old farmer, it does not matter how much air
freshener you spray around; if it is a pig, it still stinks.
His understanding is CU initially wanted Montview.
Other people favored Fitzsimons Parkway but there was
concern over parking. In his estimation, CU was
caught off guard. As it says in the bio about CU, this
is a preeminent research center. Yet somehow, they
failed to do their own research. There is a plethora of
information available about EMI if one cares to do the
research. Logically, it makes more sense to run the
alignment up Fitzsimons Parkway. He is concerned
about how all this came down but in the end, for the
greater good, he will vote for the alignment change. He
wants to make sure that RTD does not get caught with
the alignment change costs.
Director Lubow commented she can live with either
alignment. She would like to see cost protection
around this issue. She referenced the environment
memo which talked about Phase 2 and used the term
“it is unlikely.” She is not clear on what that means and
mistrusts the use of this word. Rick Clarke commented
that we can do the evaluation up to a certain point.
They plan to present to the Board in November but they
still have final design of the alignment as well as
identifying the exact location for the station. Only after
some of this work is done can they give greater
assurances. Director Lubow inquired as to whether

Packet Pg. 57

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 25, 2013 7:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of June 25, 2013)

changing the language to read “…All changes will be
made within the originally approved I-225 contract.”

construction happen after the re-evaluation is complete.
General Manager Washington responded that anything
over project budget will come back to the Board for
approval. We have never had to do this. This has led
to the success of this agency. Credence goes to the
RTD track record. The safeguard we can provide is to
come back to the Board for additional funding.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated she has had the chance
to tour the new proposed line and feels things will
move more smoothly for her. This could actually be an
asset for the NE community. However, she would like
to see some language added under “…to include a
transportation plan and implementation plan that will
accommodate the needs of persons who are transit
dependent to access the Anschutz Campus….”
Director Folska stated this is all good and interesting
conversation. She asked what the new revised
estimates for ridership were for this alignment change.
Rick Clarke responded they have only preliminary data
but estimate an approximate 5% drop with this new
alignment. This has not factored in any new
development or station planning. They are assuming
more people might be interested in riding because of
higher speed. Director Folska complimented the team
for all of their hard work.
Director Walker asked if we have any written contract
agreements with partners regarding this alignment.
There is about 30% of the engineering on Montview
completed. Rick Clarke indicated they had asked
Kiewit to stop some of their design work pending these
changes. Director Walker commented he will be
supporting this motion. He also does not feel an
amendment to change the word budget to contract is
needed nor does he want to tie the hands of a 3rd party
on something we cannot control; for these reasons he
will not approve the implementation plan request.

Director Sisk thanked staff and the City of Aurora for
responding so quickly. This is big time. Since we
talked about needing ten votes for this to pass two
weeks ago, people have been asking the tough
questions. There is a question of economics. He is
concerned that RTD will have to use our contingency
fund for this issue. He is OK with the understanding
that if an excessive amount is required, staff will come
back to the Board. There is no need for
micromanagement. However, whatever precedent gets
set by this, he wants us to keep the same standard for
other corridors.
Director James thanked staff and the Directors for
these well thought out discussions. He is familiar with
the area and likes the commitment from CU; he thinks
it is adequate. The change can be good. He questions
the need for an amendment to change budget to
contract; he also does not feel we need to tie their
hands with an implementation plan. All things
considered, he will vote in favor of the alignment.
Director Deadwyler read these remarks into the record:
As the Board member for District B, which includes the
Anschutz and Fitzsimons Campus, I have been in a
dilemma ever since staff brought the proposal to
change the I-225 alignment along Montview to another
site along Fitzsimons Parkway before this Board. I say
a dilemma because on one hand, I well understand the
strategic and economic importance of CU Anschutz
campus as one of the largest employers in this region,
but I can also empathize with constituents who are
concerned about connectivity and mobility access to
the other facilities on that campus such as the
Veterans, Children’s and University Hospitals. I have
given this a lot of thought including taking several tours
of the current alignment and future alignment if this
proposal is approved. I can see both the challenges and
benefits of either position.

When I was elected to this Board, I was elected to
represent a constituency base who felt their voices
were not being heard. It is important to me that
whatever decision we make, we remain true to our
mission. To meet our constituents present and future
public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible and cost effective service
throughout the district. Here the operative word is
Accessible. As I toured the routes with Director
Tobiassen, I acquired a greater understanding of access
options that are being planned by CU and how the
newly proposed route along Fitzsimons Parkway can
open up even more access for future community and
development use. There are currently over 22,000
employees and residents and in the future build out of
the area, that number is expected to grow to over
50,000. I believe this focus includes accessibility and I
trust that the transportation plan under consideration
will be totally inclusive across the full campus
environment, as well as providing more accessibility to
North Aurora. I am trusting CU to deliver on their
promise to provide shuttle access on the campus
without additional cost to RTD. While there are many
questions that remain unanswered as it relates to CU, I
also believe that supporting this proposal for an
alignment change will be a win-win not only for my
constituency base but also for the region as a whole.
I therefore will be supporting this proposed change to
the I-225 alignment.
Director Bagley commented this is an issue of trust for
the staff. He trusts staff based on their history with
other corridors. This is an issue with our partners. All
of us are in this together. From his previous experience
as Planning Director for the City of Aurora as well as a
neighborhood planner for the area north of I-225, he is
intimately familiar with the area. He has no doubt the
EA will be done and speeds will pick up due to the
shorter distances. This will have a big impact on
ridership and he will approve as it stands.

Chair Anderson stated it is all about the partnership.
She has worked on transit issues for a number of years.
Partnerships are very important. It is a give and take
between the RTD staff and the staff of the City of
Aurora. She is satisfied with the motion as it is. We
need to give the people who are involved a chance to
work out the details without restrictions by the RTD
Board. The budget is most appropriate. She is
concerned about changing the word to contract. This
is a partnership. We need to leave the wording as is.
Director Hoy stated that we have had a good
relationship with the City of Aurora. He has some
discomfort with our stakeholder, CU, who has made
this big alignment change request but is not willing to
come up with the finances to help if this increases our
cost. He will make an amendment to the motion.
Primary Amendment 1
To the Main Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to amend the main
motion as follows:”…The exact location will be defined
as part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora,
the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as
public input, and also to include implementation of a
transportation plan whose cost shall not be paid for by
RTD and will accommodate the needs of persons who
are transit dependent to access the Anschutz campus.
A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit
1. All changes will be made within the originally
approved I-225 contract.”
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Walker stated we cannot require a 3rd party to
pay for something. We need to trust our partners. He
cannot support this amendment.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated she understands some
of the comments made and withdraws her

8.A

Point of Order: Legal Counsel Rolf Asphaug explained
Director Rivera-Malpiede could not withdraw her
request in this form.
Director Tobiassen commented this is why we pay staff
to negotiate and do what they do. We need to press
on. There will be other challenges on this and any
other construction.
Director Lasater expressed concern that in the end, this
will fall on the back of RTD. The public will not go to
CU or the City of Aurora demanding shuttle service.
They will come to RTD demanding we provide this
service. At a minimum, we need some form of IGA with
CU stating their commitment.
Director Daly stated he will support the staff. He has
trust in the staff.
Rick Clarke made several comments. If this gets tied to
a contract, there can be numerous delays in the project
as staff will have to come back to the Board numerous
times. Each time could put a delay of 30 days into the
process. Right now, the contractors are willing to work
with staff but there will be some hesitation if they
know every item needs to be approved by the Board.
When he looks at the number of sequential changes
this will require, at a minimum he can see six separate
times they will have to come back to the Board. He is
concerned about what this amendment can do to the
schedule. General Manager Washington added that
RTD will be left holding the bag. Another way to look
at this is if the Board approves the change in alignment,
they may be applauded for their vision when new
development comes with along the new alignment.
Director Sisk called for the question.

Board Report August 2013 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the proposed August 2013 Service Change as revised and summarized
in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost increase of $1,108,900 and, further, to
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose services are impacted by these changes.
Motion for a
Recess:

Director Lasater requested a recess.
Director Sisk seconded.
The Board recessed from 7:55 p.m. to 8:05 p.m.

Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to approve item F,
August 2013 Service Changes.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

AGM Bruce Abel shared with the Board that staff had
indicated they were working on the issue of the 16L
and would bring any changes back to the Board if they
could reach an agreement prior to the approval of this
action. He is happy to inform the Board that his staff,

8.A

along with Directors Rivera-Malpiede and Menten had
worked with the 9 to 5 organization and other
organizations in the area to arrive at an agreement. This
additional recommendation was included in their packet
for tonight but he wanted to make sure everyone
understands this change. The essence of it will be to
reinstate the 16L. The proposed changes to expand
the 16 will not occur so the net result is a wash. The
16 bus will be an articulated bus to handle the large
volume of users; the 16L will run during the week, but
on weekends and nights, the 16 will be expanded to go
into Golden. Because of this change, they will have to
fine-tune the route 100W on Quail/Simms streets.
Director Rivera-Malpiede applauded the team for this
collaborative effort. This was an example of the
community coming forward and being adamant about
their bus service. This is her district and represents the
transit dependent who must rely on public
transportation. The staff did a yeomen job in turning
this around so quickly and she thanks Rob Rynerson,
Jessie Carter and Bruce Abel for their hard work.
Director Daly echoed his thanks to the team for their
flexibility on this change. He asked for clarification on
where the articulated bus would be. Bruce Abel replied
the route 16.
Director Tobiassen echoed the thanks. He asked Jessie
Carter to clarify the change that was being made to
route 130.
Director Walker echoed the thanks on staff’s
responsiveness.
Director Sisk asked for a stay of execution for the
residents on route 209G. We need to keep this route in
place.
Motion:

Director Folska made a motion to keep route 209G in
place until the next planning cycle for service changes.

Discussion:

Director Deadwyler expressed concern over the amount
of items staff purchases and discards. She stated with
the technological changes occurring so fast she is

somewhere.

Date:

Board Meeting Date: July 16, 2013

Subject:

2013 Title VI Service Monitoring

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors review and approve the
2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with
federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI). Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin from
recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc...). RTD complies with Title VI by
committing to the following guiding principles:
1. Ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. Preserve the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services, providing equal access for any
person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. Create opportunities for the public to participate in transit planning and decision-making without
regard to race, color or national origin;
4. Select the location of transit services and facilities without regard to race, color or national origin;
and
5. Take prompt and immediate action to correct and remediate disparate impacts borne by any
group of people of a race, color, or national origin.
The Title VI Service Monitoring Program is one of the mechanisms used to follow these guiding
principles.
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, as an operator of 50 or more fixed route vehicles in peak service, which is
located in an urbanized area, RTD is required to monitor the application of its service standards and
policies with respect to fixed route service. To determine if service standards and policies are adhered to
indiscriminately, the service provided to minority populations is compared to service provided to nonminority populations as required by FTA guidance. The 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results report
describes the scope, method and results of RTD’s Service Monitoring. The FTA also requires transit
providers to officially establish the frequency in which Title VI Service Monitoring will occur. Future Title

Packet Pg. 69

11.A

VI Service Monitoring will occur and be reported annually, as a part of the Service Performance Report
presented by Service Development.
The highlights and action items resulting from the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring are summarized in
the presentation attached to this board report. The full report is available separately in the Board Office
for review.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and annual monitoring frequency do not
result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board
of Directors review and approve the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future
monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
2) Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as it could jeopardize current
and future federal funding.

2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
The SBP provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2014-2019 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2014-2019 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2013 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
July 9th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on July 16th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2013 Amended Budget. The column titled “Amended Budget 2013” in Exhibit I incorporates
revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 83

12.B

The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School, and reductions, eliminations or deferrals of
SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $113.7 million in 2014 is forecast to decrease by $2.4 million
from 2013 due to transfer of revenue (and ridership) from bus to the West
Line. This represents ridership revenue that West Line has gained and bus has
lost. In future years, fare revenue includes a 10% farebox rate increase in
2015 and 2017 per Board policy of an optional 10% fare rate increase every 3
years.
 Sales and use tax incorporates the June quarterly update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2013-2019.
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
recent congressional actions.
 Fixed guideway and capital maintenance grant revenue is increased at the area
CPI inflation rates (from the CLC) with a doubling of fixed guideway grant
revenue (additional $8.7 million) in 2014 resulting from the seven-year
operating anniversary of the Southeast corridor.
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates of 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in
2015-2019. Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated
amount through 2017 then escalated at the CPI rate.
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base
System, will be held at the 2013 level in 2014, and beginning with 2014 increased
by the CPI rate serially each year.
 Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects are included (Exhibit III).
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in
investable balances.
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each
year by using amortization tables. Projected interest payments on future debt issues
are based on current municipal rate forward curves. Interest payment assumptions
incorporate recent upticks in interest rates on the forward curve.
 Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects
and replacements (Exhibit II).
 Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund, staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and/or capital
replacement fund be maintained at a minimum $3.0 million each year until each fund
reaches the minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur no later than
2019. During 2017, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to reach
$30 million.
 Contributions to fund balances include the Base System’s FISA contribution from sale
of Civic Center air rights.
 Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition. Debt
payments are derived from debt amortization schedules.
 Non-cash items include the estimated year-end net pension obligation offset by yearend accruals.

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax
revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an
impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2014
budget period.
Current key financial indicators for the SBP are (in millions):

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2014-2019 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2014-2019 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2014 budget

process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2014 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2014-2019
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2014 budget process.

 Currently our patrons are walking a considerable distance from the pnR to the existing bus stops. Often our patrons are parking illegal to
be closer to the stops. With the widening of US 36, as part of the US36 Managed Lanes Project, it is anticipated that there will be
sufficient space to relocate these bus stops closer to the pnR areas, which will create better connectivity.

higher rider satisfaction.
 Delivering this information to customers is an expected part of modern transit systems. TIS is continually requested by customers and
those requests have been answered by responding that the information is coming when we replace our CAD/AVL systems. This is an
innovative way to deliver high customer service, will directly enhance constituent communications, and will likely grow ridership.

 Rail Transportation Training is currently housed in temporary, leased trailers. Rail Operations originally intended to move into the vacated
MOW building at Mariposa, but we have determined that this location works better. The current facility does not have a water or sewer
hookup. We want to replace these rented trailers with a more permanent, purchased facility. Facilities Maintenance has determined that
this is feasible.
 The current leased facilities have no sewer hookup. We pay to have the holding tanks service twice a week. The combined monthly
expense exceeds $2200 a month.

 Project is to retrofit the currently manually operated track crossovers with powered switch machines, electric switch heaters and provide
means for SCADA control of these switches. Most locations will require a new Xcel power feed, a relay house, and associated equipment.
Project will also require modifications to the signal programming to incorporate this upgrade.
 The purpose of this modification is to provide quicker response with operational flexibility when track segments are taken out of service
unexpectedly. Operations, maintenance and the patrons will benefit from this enhancement to the system.

 Demo existing concrete ADA tactile strips from the original TREX SEC construction project and replace with new ADA tactile units
which are embedded into the concrete and are designed to be removed and replaced without additional concrete demolition.
 Current tactile strips have become brittle and are “popping” loose from the concrete. They are the original generation of the tactile strips
and are no longer available to be ordered for replacements. Additionally, they do not adhere well once they come loose and have to be
reattached via pop rivets by the FM crew. They are unsightly and are causing a potential tripping hazard to both the visually-impaired as

 Light Rail has been in service for 19 years, has grown to 90 track miles with future expansion plans funded and in place. The track
geometry and resulting ride quality deteriorates over time and has come to a point where our current practice of contracting the work out
no longer provides the necessary timely maintenance. With the equipment necessary to perform major track maintenance and repair our
in-house work force could accomplish these tasks on a regular basis rather than waiting for a large enough job to contract out or waiting
for a contractor to mobilize into our area.

 The request is for armed uniform security officers to patrol and provide visible security presence at DUS. This will require 336 hours of
coverage per week.
 RTD currently provides armed security officers for Market Street, Civic Center, and the Boulder bus terminal. Due to the large expansion
of the DUS complex and the unique underground bus terminal, these hours need to be added in order to maintain the level of security
coverage that exists at our other bus stations.

 This project is to support existing integrated software support fees and vendor technical support fees for integrated security systems which
include automatic software upgrades. Fees are charged to RTD from existing vendors based on amount of servers, software packages and
monitored service accounts.
 The above fees are associated with active RTD integrated security operations that are currently in place to control access to facilities and
monitoring of criminal or dangerous activity. In the past, these fees were paid via maintenance contractor and rebilled to RTD on
contract.

 Replacement of Boeing (VSOC) Virtual Security Operations Console server and software package.
 The system was abandoned last year because new West Corridor cameras could not be incorporated into the software. Newer PSIM
technology allows security command centers to operate regionally and offers the ability to grow in module to manage other types of
security platforms.

Per the U.S. Department of Transportation guidance and regulations, all recipients
of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 •and its related laws and regulations. As a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) submits an annual assurance
of compliance with Title VI as a part of RTD’s annual submission of Certifications
and Assurances, as required per 49 CFR part 21.7. Accordingly, RTD’s Planning
Department will review the district’s services in its entirety for compliance with
Title VI. This review will include a review of the Strategic Budget Plan as
necessary, pursuant to ensuring non-discrimination on basis of race, color and
national origin. Should any Title VI violations become evident, remedial and/or
mitigating measures will be developed to restore equity and achieve compliance
with Title VI.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 11, 2013

From:

Paula Perdue, Executive Director

GM

Date:

July 11, 2013

Board Meeting Date: July 16, 2013

Subject:

Approval of General Manager's 2014 Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s goals for 2014 as defined in the attached General
Manager Performance Evaluation Form.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee is working with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010 the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals will include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs at the beginning of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
salaried employee performance evaluation form that is used by the rest of the RTD employees. This
action item is to formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed these 2014 core and task goals with the General Manager and unanimously approved
them on 7/09/13 to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2014 and the five task goals for 2014 and the attached General Manager Tactical Plan for
2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to implementing this policy.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2014 goals. This will
complete the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager to revise the 2014
goals. This will delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear and documented process.
