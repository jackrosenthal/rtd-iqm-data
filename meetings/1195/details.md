## IV. Retiree Awards

There were no retirees present for this meeting.  However, Director Daly spoke about Joe Stogner, street supervisor who retired with over 36 years of service.  Director Daly indicated that he worked with Joe when he was an employee at RTD.  Joe was a hardworking man and always had a little business on the side.  Undoubtedly he has one now and he wishes him all the best.

## V. Public Participation

- Ricky Martinez, RMR, stated that he does not support the injustice that Rocky Mountain Reinforcement Company has put him through.  He received a pay cut and they had several safety infractions.

- Louis Apolinar who also worked for RMR referenced that RMR has been hired on two RTD projects, DUS and Eagle.  He also received a pay cut and has to scramble to pay his bills.  He is just looking for justice and dignity for the RMR employees.

- Jim Toweill with the ironworkers commented they have not heard back from the Board. This is an ongoing issue with RMR.  If RMR is hired to work on the North Metro project and this has federal funds, this could be an area of concern.  He passed out a handout about RMR.  A copy of this handout can be found in the Board meeting file located in the Board office.

- Doug Gregg, Denver, complimented this Board on being one of the hardest working Boards that he has seen.  He also asked about the collection of pictures that were at the Denver Union Station.  He shared a problem that he had with pickup to get to the Board meeting.

- She attended the DRCOG Sustainable Community meeting this morning.

## X. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington shared that the North Metro quarterly meeting with the stakeholders on July 11 was well received.  They discussed the North Metro RFP.  There will be a Northwest Quarterly meeting on July 18 where they will also discuss the RFP for North Metro and the Northwest Mobility Study.

- General Manager Washington attended the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials National Conference which was held in Jacksonville, Florida.  He did a number of presentations.  The Colorado Chapter is most aggressive and had much to share about the DUS and Eagle P3 project.

- The 2013 Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX) is meeting in Denver this week.  The agencies currently participating in this program are Denver, Los Angeles and Dallas.  This was a brainchild of General Manager Washington and Art Leahy in LA as a way to share best practices and knowledge sharing across agencies.  They are looking to add Atlanta to this group.  His goal is to have a MAX program for every quadrant of the country.  He expects his counterpart, CEO Gary Thomas from Dallas, to attend the graduation services on July 18.

- The 2013 APTA Leadership program is also meeting in Denver this week.  They have a number of presentations and sessions planned.  The GM and his staff will be actively participating on panels and other discussions for APTA Leadership.  Director Rivera-Malpiede has also been invited to participate on two panel discussions.  The APTA Leadership is a 12-month program where the participants will graduate at the annual APTA meeting in October.  Jenni Barket, Legal Counsel, currently is RTD representative.

- General Manager Washington has been asked to be the keynote speaker at Colorado Futuretek Luncheon on July 20.  This organization works with training youth and underrepresented minorities high school students including providing internships, etc.

- General Manager Washington announced we will be celebrating the 50% completion of the Eagle project in August, 2013.  We have the only PPP in the country for transit program so all eyes are on us.  He spoke to FTA Administrator Rogoff about this event and invited him to attend.

- General Manager Washington announced the DUS Bus Terminal Opening on May 9, 2014.  This is ahead of the internal anticipated completion date.  This date has been set and includes the moving of Amtrak in DUS.  They stood up an activation team about a year ago. The grand opening will be May 9, the shutdown of Market Station will be May 10 and the cutover will be coordinated with the runboard of May 11, 2014.  We are coordinating with DUSPA and USA who plans to open the hotel and retail facilities in late July.

- General Manager Washington shared that around August 1, 2013, DIA will be moving the Sky ride drop off point to the west side as they shift the work to the Eastside.  This will probably remain until sometime in 2014.  They will work with DIA to make sure proper signage and notification of the change is in place.

- Next Monday and Tuesday, Sound Transit will be visiting to learn about how RTD integrated new lines into our existing system.  He has often stated we have become the farm agency for the transit industry and this demonstrates that more and more agencies want to emulate our success.

- General Manager Washington shared that DRCOG Executive Director Jennifer Schaufele had asked him, to provide a non-voting staff member to the DCCOG Board.  He has appointed Bill Van Meter as that representative.

Questions/comments from Board members:

- Director Daly inquired if the downtown Denver circulator will be operative at the grand opening of the DUS Bus terminal.  General Manager Washington replied he hoped so but there is work to be done.

- Director Daly referenced the comments made from the RMR representatives during public hearing and asked if our compliance team could get with them to share the information they had provided to the Board.  General Manager Washington stated he would look at this.

- Director Lubow asked about the request for a non-voting member on the DRCOG Board.  General Manager Washington stated he imagine it is to provide staff expertise with their staff on a number of things.  He has been in discussion with Jennifer for 6-8 months now.

- Director James commented that this sounds appropriate.  DRCOG is working on some demand management things and the coordination between RTD and DRCOG makes sense.  Pertaining to Union Station coordination, Amtrak may be on a critical path.  Marla Lien responded that Amtrak and RTD have been meeting and have resolved most of the critical points.  They are planning another meeting around September and hopefully we can iron out those last few issues.

- Director Menten inquired about the MAX program.  General Manager Washington shared it is a program that was started by him and the CEO in Los Angeles and later Dallas to put together best practices and the sharing of information.  This has saved millions of dollars for the agencies.

- Director Folska inquired about the circulators and the street modifications to the bus bowls.  She expressed a concern that if bikes are allowed in this bus bowls it can be a problem for the visually impaired community.

- Director Sisk inquired about the US 36 problem that occurred this morning when US 36 was closed in both directions.  His concern was on our notification process and how do we communicate this to our users.  Scott Reed, AGM communications indicated they used various media-riders alerts, posted on website, social media, and dispatched where accessible.

- Director Rivera-Malpiede indicated it is important that we have good communications on these changes to the location for SkyRide at DIA.

Discussion:              Director Lubow thanked the General Manager for inclusion of some of the comments into his goal; however, the measurement standard for the “grow the ridership” goal is not yet a measurement standard that we can say yes we met that goal.  She would like to see the “grow the ridership goal” at the strategic planning advance for 2015.

General Manager Washington explained that the reason why she does not see the measurement goal in this document is because these are his goals for 2014.  In the meeting, she had given him the task to define that measurement in 2013.  He has a team that will be looking at this in 2013 and will come back to the Board in the fall (October) to discuss a possible measurement goal that can be applied in 2014 per his goal for exceed expectations.

Director Folska stated she is excited about the “grow the ridership” goal.

## XIII. Old Business

- Director Folska expressed concerns over signage.  She would like to see some form of sub-task group to look at signage in the district (i.e. buses, handicapped areas, DUS, SkyRide, etc.).  The signage should be ubiquitous.

- Director Folska would like for the fare taskforce to look at the 10-book ride expiration date.

- Director Bagley reminded the Board that the Railvolution conference will be in Seattle in late October.  This is one of the most important conferences the members can attend to stay abreast of changes around rail, economic development and impacts and especially transit TOD.  He knows a number of Board members are planning to attend (i.e. Directors Bagley, James, Sisk, Rivera-Malpiede and Chair Anderson).

- Director Bagley thinks focus on the state of good repair as a safety item is important.

- Director Bagley attended the MAX Program reception and had a chance to talk to a few of the participants.  They stated this is a very productive program where they have a chance to learn and share ideas-some of them felt it was more worthwhile than Leadership APTA.  It is important that we invest in human capital.

- Director Menten referenced a previous Executive Committee meeting where they discussed having Board members to prepare a trip-tic when they attend conferences or travel outside of the district using RTD funds.  She stated she believes it is a good idea to have a policy in place to request a trip report and this adds to the accountability.  It also allows information to be shared with Board members who are unable to attend.

- Director Walker shared he too had a chance to speak to some of the MAX participants.  This is a good way to do industry knowledge exchange.  He also referenced some article he had read around the use of P3’s that he found thought provoking.
