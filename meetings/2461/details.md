#### 1. Longmont Free Fare Buy Up

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that RTD approve a new contract with Boulder County to allow the County to continue to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services, herein referenced as “the 300 series.”  Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of an additional 18 months.

Motion:              Director Lubow made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the April 19, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Service, explained that Boulder County would like to continue to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont for an additional 18 months.  Boulder County feels this program will continue to serve their low income population.  As with the program before there is no cost to RTD.  Director Bagley noted that boardings have effectively doubled since this program was initiated.  He expressed his concern about the precedent this “buy up” is setting in the City of Longmont.  He wants to make sure there were no promises made that this would continue if Boulder County decided not to “buy up” the fares.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, responded that there have been no representations made that this would do anything but revert back to paid fares if the County chooses not to extend the program.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. University of Colorado A Line

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Program, shared that staff wanted to review the process for the opening next week.  He said we are on schedule to open on April 22.  Though there have been challenges staff is overcoming these obstacles.

Adrian Mabry, Manager of Projects and Contracts, reviewed the following events

- Thursday, April 21, 2016 – 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm – VIP Reception – Westin DIA – Transportation will be provided via the University of Colorado A-Line at Union Station or 40th and Airport beginning at 4:30 p.m.  There is a video presentation at 7:00 p.m. and the last train will leave the airport at 9:00 p.m.

- Saturday, April 23, 2016 – 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. – University of Colorado A Line Station Parties, All University of Colorado A Line Stations – Stakeholder groups are hosting a party at each station.  There will be free rides on all lines from 5:00 am until end-of-service for that day.  The University of Colorado A-Line will operate until 10:00 p.m. and then begin revenue service on Sunday

Director Folska asked how many invitations had been sent out for the VIP event.  Adrian Mabry responded that well over 1000 invites had been sent out and each invitee could bring a guest.  The VIP RSVP list currently stands at 1040.  Committee Chair Anderson stated that this opening was going to be an exciting week that everyone was looking forward to. She thanked the staff.

#### 2. US36 BRT Flatiron Flyer Ridership Comparison Powerpoint

Nataly Erving, Senior Service Planner/Scheduler, reviewed a PowerPoint presentation that was included in the April 12, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  It outlined a comparison of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Flatiron Flyer ridership performance of the US36 Corridor from January 2012 (Before the US36 Construction) to August 2015 (Completion of US36 Construction Phase I) and January 2016 (Start of US36 BRT Flatiron Flyer Service).In 2012 there were 12 patterns along this US36 corridor and it made it confusing for the passengers.  This has been consolidated to 6 patterns in this corridor, making it easier and less confusing.

Nataly Erving shared that the ridership increase from January 2012 to January 2016 was 66.8%.  She said the ridership pattern breakdown has shown that the FF1 carries the majority of the corridor ship with an increase from 4,000 average weekday ridership in 2012 to 6,000 average weekday ridership in 2016, followed by FF2 and FF4 performing strongly in this corridor.  She stated demand is still very similar but overall ridership numbers are up; specifically, ridership has increased throughout the entire day, not just peak periods.  This shows that the 15 minute all-day bidirectional service plan is working.  There is a lot more activity within the corridor, not just Boulder/Denver centric as it was before.  She pointed out the intent of the plan was to do just that so staff is pleased with the results so far.

Director Folska asked if staff could find out what the population density increase has been for this corridor from 2012 to 2016.  Nataly Erving stated that she would look into that for Director Folska.

Director Sisk stated that he felt it was great to see this flourishing. He inquired about how staff monitors growth in the community and how to know when additional service is needed.

Nataly Erving answered  that by using daily monitoring from ride check data, fare box revenue, etc., it allows staff to recognize where the demand is coming from.  She said as RTD’s service standards warrant, staff will make adjustments as best they can.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, stated that customers in this corridor are not shy in contacting the RTD in order to express their needs and any problems or shortfalls they are experiencing using the RTD services.

Bruce Abel stated that he is aware that we have two styles of monitoring happening for the US36 Corridor today.  He said what Nataly Erving outlined is at the micro level.  He explained on the macro level staff monitors the build out of various communities and work with stakeholders to monitor what is coming down the pipe.  Bruce Abel gave an example of Google moving into Boulder.   He shared when the service plan was first implemented the community said we needed to increase service to Boulder Junction because Google isbuilding there; however, while staff agrees that more service will be needed in the future, Google is not there today.  This is an example of needing to work with the community and Google to understand the timeline for when the demand might occur.

Director Sisk pointed out that there are beautiful stations that are still under construction, mainly the McCaslin Station.  He said he is concerned about public safety in these areas especially at night when visibility is not as good.  He stated it is not mission accomplished yet and wondered when this might be finished.  Nataly Erving said that she speaks with the project coordinators at least once a week.  She shared they are going through their punch list and initially thought they would be finished in the middle of April; however, there have been weather conditions that delayed the timelines. She indicated the team is being diligent that all their items on their punch list are completed.

Director Hoy shared that he and Nataly have become a good team and work together to respond to customer issues.  He said he was happy that the constituents were becoming more messengers of information rather than complainers.  He asked Nataly Erving not to abandon him next week with all the upcoming runboard changes as he does have a little bit of angst.  Nataly Erving stated staff would be watching very closely at the Sheridan station to address any issues quickly.

Director Folska asked if staff could specifically articulate the criteria or factors that indicate a need to increase service.  Nataly Erving answered that she works within the service standards that are given to her by the Board.  If there is a fully seated load and the trip before and the trip after are also fully seated then that indicates we are at capacity and additional service might be warranted.  She noted if there is a fully seated load but the trip before and after have capacity then staff will look to make minor trip adjustments to try and balance the loads.   She stated it is a very fine tuned tweaking process.

Director Folska stated the Super Bowl Parade situation as an example of high capacity demand but a one off situation that staff probably would not use in evaluating capacity.  She wondered if there is a timeframe around evaluating capacity before determining that it has been met  Director Folska requested that this information be sent to her in an e-mail format.  Jessie Carter answered that his department would forward this information to Director Folska.

Committee Chair Anderson asked if the opening of the Eagle project would affect any of the routes from Boulder, specifically the routes between Boulder and Anschutz.  She has had constituents asking her this question.  Nataly Erving answered there would be some impacts. The AB will be rerouted along the Northwest Parkway because the demand at the Broomfield and Westminster Park-n-Rides do not warrant direct service to DIA.  Passengers who want to get to the airport from those stations will still have multiple options available.  Nataly Erving said that as it relates to Anschutz, she anticipates some shifting with the opening of the R-Line which is why staff will closely monitor what happens on the FF5.  At this time she does not know what changes, if any, might be proposed.

#### 3. Proposed August 2016 Service Change

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the process is to present draft recommendations to the Board, solicit public comment, and then come back to the Board with final recommendations for approval. Jessie Carter characterized the August service changes as typical; however, there are two notable changes. The first is the new Route 62 which will provide service from Central Park Boulevard Station to Commerce City.  This route is grant funded so it is at no cost to RTD.  Staff hopes to see strong ridership.  The second item is an increase on the service on the Free Metro Ride from a 6 minute headway down to a 4 ½ minute frequency.  Staff believes this will be needed with the opening of the University of Colorado A-Line line in April.

Director Francone asked if Jessie Carter could explain to her about the CV/CS/CX conversion of a trip.  Jessie Carter explained that one CV trip leaving Civic Center Station would be converted to a Route CS trip so it would now serve Federal Center Station as well.

Director Francone recognized the performance of the Lockheed Martin Call-n-Ride had been iffy.  She asked if there were any new ridership numbers.  Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, stated at last count it was doing okay with 4 to 5 passengers per trip.

Director Lubow asked about the BOLT service change that would convert 4 morning trips and 3 evening trips to express routes.  Nataly Erving explained that staff was working with the City of Longmont regarding this.  There was a request for such a service.  This addresses the request for a faster trip and for a connection to Boulder Junction from Longmont.  She stated if successful, there will be further conversations about how to move forward.

Director Lubow asked for more information about the consolidation/elimination of exception stops for Routes BOLT, J and L within Longmont.   Nataly Erving that the currently the exception stops are very confusing as they are different for each route.  Staff and the City of Longmont met to review the entire list of stops to consolidate the exception stops along all three routes to make it easier for commuters.  Director Lubow thanked staff as she agreed the old schedule was very confusing.  Director Menten noted with the proposed change of the 5:07 p.m. Route CV staff was also proposing trip adjustments for the westbound trips of up to 10 minutes.  She wondered how many trips that affected.  Jessie Carter stated at this point of time he could not say as the final schedule has not yet been written.  He committed to come back to Director Menten when he was able to provide the actual schedule.

Director Menten inquired if any progress had been made with regards to getting the TSA employees to the airport.  Jessie Carter stated that route AT changes in the service plan for April will get people to the airport by 3:15 a.m. which satisfies the 3:30 a.m. request; however, nothing has been set for Stapleton or Central Park Boulevard Station as of now.

Director Menten noted that service change hearings were scheduled in Longmont, Denver and Commerce City.  She wondered if there was any reason one might be needed on the West side considering the changes for Routes 1, 3, 11, 16, 28, 7 and the 6.  Jessie Carter answered that these are all primarily related to our standard school adjustments so he did not see a reason to have one on the West side; however, the meetings in Commerce City and Longmont  are because of the new services and the very confusing stop consolidation that Nataly Erving just explained.

#### 4. Lost Service Hours Update

Bruce Abel stated that a report on lost service hours was included in the April 12, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet, which he is calling the tale of two cities.  On the negative side there was an overall increase in the number of lost service hours; however, if we factor out the two snow days on March 23 & March 24 where our 4” to 6” forecast turned into a 16” to 18”, March has a marked improvement.

He believes that although we have not yet turned the corner, April to-date is looking very positive in terms of our performance as we continue to reduce our lost hours of service.

#### 5. Hiring Update 4 12 16

Bruce Abel stated included in the April 12, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet is a report tracking operator hiring and training.  Staff’s objective is to have at least 20 participants attending classes every other week.  During April staff was successful in maintaining class numbers in the high teens.  He indicated his team would continue to work with HR to address our staffing challenges.   He pointed out that as hiring and training improve we can see it has a direct result on our lost service hours going down.  He stated mandated overtime is still part of the equation but beginning to go down as well.

Director Archuleta asked how many drivers we were short.  Bruce Abel stated that we are under 100 short, which is the lowest number we have had in many years.  He said when he looked on Monday the number was 83, so he is happy to see improvements in that arena and he is hoping it continues to manifest in even lower lost service hours going forward.

### D. Other Matters

Committee Chair Anderson shared that she recently attended a transportation meeting in Adams County. During the meeting, Excel Energy made a presentation about locating a substation in Thornton.  There are currently three places in Thornton that Excel would like to locate a substation as Thornton is running out of reliable power in the area.  Committee Chair Anderson said she brought up the subject of transportation and how power can impact the on-time operations for our buses, for example if traffic signals are not working and cause a traffic jam.  She was asked to address the Thornton City Council, which she declined but wonders if the Board should express to the Thornton City Council how important reliable electric power is to on-time performance of buses and the future operations of the Northwest Rail via a letter from Chair Tobiassen.

Director Hoy commented that the substation issue has been going on for a long time and he feels it really should be resolved; however, he did not connect it with traffic signals not working  He believes the trains have their own power brought in to ensure they run.

Director Sisk commented that we need to tread carefully in the way we approach our communications with city councils as he is not sure a letter from the RTD Board on this topic would be well received.  He would have qualms sending any letter that can be viewed as invasive of what is really their decision.

Director Walker does not think it is beyond the bounds of appropriate for RTD to express concerns to city councils, city managers, etc. about issues that could affect agency operations because it is all connected.  He thinks RTD needs to be considered as part of the City as what we do effects the operations, functionality and economics of our cities.  He would be in support of sending some type of letter.

Director Anderson said that in listening to Director Sisk and to take it out of the realm of politics, it may be better to have communication be from staff.  Director Hoy stated that he agreed communication from staff to staff made sense.

General Manager Genova indicated staff would follow-up with the City.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 6:28 p.m.
