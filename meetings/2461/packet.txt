BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: April 19, 2016

Subject:

Longmont Free Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that RTD approve a new contract
with Boulder County to allow the County to continue to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local
fixed route services, herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323,
324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of an additional 18 months.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. The current contract was for a period of two years from July 1, 2014 – June 30,
2016. The County would like to continue the program.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined in
Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build ridership
and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of the
program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within their thresholds; any new cost will
be borne by Boulder County. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, have
performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of RTD
Marketing. RTD will continue to promote this program. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will
hold meetings to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 18 month period, Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD $391,806 for fares on the
300 series routes and approximately $21,150 for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service
area boundaries of the 300 series routes (the Access-a-Ride dollars are approximate and the County will
reimburse based on actual usage). Calculations for this reimbursement are based on the original dollar
amount established in the 2014 contract which was based on the 300 series fare revenue from 2012.
This new dollar amount reflects the new fare structure and an additional 8% to reflect the new riders.
There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the County or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.
Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). In 2015 boardings increased
to 313,692.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.

Proposed August 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two grant funded proposals anticipated to be implemented in the August service change. Funded
through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate between the Central Park Boulevard Station
and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. Also funded through a CMAQ grant, enhancements to the frequency
of the Free Metro Ride operating between DUS and Civic Center Station are proposed. We will monitor
customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: new grant funded route service between Central Park Boulevard
Station to 60th/Dahila.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale: add a 5:04am weekday and 5:39am weekend trips from Civic Center
Station to Nine Mile.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: shift 12:15am from 40th & Airport Station to 12:45am.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip
Free MetroRide: increase peak period frequency to operate every 4.5 minutes.

Packet Pg. 12

1.C.3

Routes proposed for service reductions:
BroncosRide and CU/CSU Game: discontinue BroncosRide and CU/CSU special service from the
Montbello park-nRide.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: cutback 2:57pm eastbound trip from Federal Center Station, to instead
originate at Lakewood Commons at 3:15pm.
Route 31 – Federal Crosstown: extend and convert a Route 30 trip to 72nd Avenue as a Route 31 trip
and shift the afternoon northbound school tripper.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown: reroute to serve the new Westminster (Rail) Station
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont: convert selected peak trips to become express trips.
Route CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver: convert one Route CV trip leaving Civic Center
Station a Route CS trip.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 1 – 1st Avenue: running time analysis to improve on-time performance
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 16 – West Colfax: minor schedule adjustments
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: minor schedule adjustments
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road: running time and trip time adjustments
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments

Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Resume seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F
(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $719,170 annualized,
with $672,800 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $46,370.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
There are 4 public hearings proposed to be held between May 19th and May 24th in Commerce City,
Denver and Longmont.
A Look Ahead – January 2017
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Boulevard
Due to the likely increase in ridership caused by extending the service to the Auraria Campus the peak
periods will have to be monitored for need of additional capacity.
E Line
Responding to recent growth on the E Line weekday midday period (9:30 AM-2:30 PM) warrants an
increase in service to provide 15-minute service.
