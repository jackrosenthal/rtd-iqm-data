Budget Transfer for Planning Grant Projects

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 7, 2017

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 19, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $4.664 million from the Operating Reserve to the Planning
base system expense grant project budget, effective January 1, 2018, to allow for the completion of
grant-funded projects that will not be completed in 2017. The Operating Reserve will be replenished
in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that were not spent on these projects in 2017.
BACKGROUND
The 2017 Amended Budget included funding for two grant-funded planning studies. The Regional
BRT Feasibility Study is funded by a DRCOG TIP planning grant for $1 million, with a local match of
$250,000 provided by RTD. The Board will be asked to approve the contract award for this study at
the December meeting. The First and Last Mile Strategic Plan is funded by $200,000 in CDOT
FASTER funding, with a local match of $200,000 from RTD. This project is in process, and the
Board was briefed on its status at the December meeting of the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee.
In addition to performing its own planning projects, RTD also passes through federal grant funds for
planning studies to other entities who are not eligible to receive the grants directly from FTA. In
those cases, RTD passes through the grant funds to its partner agencies, and the agencies provide
the local match for the federal funding, for a net zero cost to RTD. The 2017 Amended Budget
included funding for 10 pass-through grant-funded planning projects related to the base system, at a
total project cost of approximately $3.55 million, including local match to be provided by the partner
entities.
DISCUSSION
The 2018 Adopted Budget assumed that all of the base planning projects would be completed in
2017, and the full cost of these projects was included in the year-end 2017 projected expenditure
for the Planning Department. However, the actual year-to-date expenditures on these projects are
approximately $540,000, and it has become apparent since the 2018 Adopted Budget was
completed that the balance of the funding will not be spent before the end of 2017. This transfer
will allow RTD and its partner entities to continue work on these ongoing projects without
jeopardizing receipt of the associated grant funds.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. Funding for these projects was included in the 2017
Amended Budget. The savings to RTD from not completing these projects in 2017 will be carried
forward and be used to replenish the Operating Reserve at the time of the 2018 Amended Budget.

1.C.1

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $4.664 million from the
Operating Reserve to the Planning expense grant project budget, effective January 1, 2018,
to allow for the completion of grant-funded projects that will not be completed in 2017. The
Operating Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that were
not spent on these projects in 2017.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2018 Amended Budget. This action is
not recommended since it will require RTD to suspend work on the ongoing projects, and will
not allow RTD to meet its commitments to pass through Federal grant funds to other local
entities. Furthermore, this action would jeopardize receipt of $1 million in DRCOG TIP funds
for the Regional BRT Feasibility Study.

Quarterly

Performance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt updated 2018 Quarterly Performance Measures to include measures for ridership, fare revenue,
and total operating revenue.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
The year-to-date performance measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it
provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives.
In 2018, 41 performance measures will be tracked for the GM.
When the 2018 performance measures were adopted by the Board in April 2017, it was stated the
following measures would be established by the financial plans inherent in the 2018 Adopted Budget.
These measures are as follows:
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
It is recommended that the revenue ridership increase for 2018 be established at 3.4%. This assumes
ridership growth over 2017 will be flat on the Base System with ridership increases attributed to
FasTracks, mainly the Gold Line and A Line. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2018 be established at 3.0%. This is the
percentage increase in total fare revenue in the 2018 Adopted Budget over the 2017 projection. The
increase is driven by increased ridership in FasTracks as Base System ridership and fare revenue are
projected to be flat in 2018. This is an annual measure.
It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2018 be established at 2.6%. This is
the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2018 Adopted Budget over the 2017
projection, which takes into account incidental items of operating revenue such as advertising, joint
venture, parking, and other miscellaneous revenue. This is an annual measure.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors adopt updated 2018 Quarterly Performance Measures to
include measures for ridership, fare revenue, and total operating revenue.

2. Don’t Accept the Recommendation Action. This would leave us without measures for
ridership, fare revenue, and total operating revenue.

1 The measure reports on resolution of customer complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the
number includes all departments utilizing TrapezeCOM system for commendation and complaint research.
2 All three carriers had a high number of complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late,
discourtesy, passed up passengers at stop) along with a decrease in ridership. “No show” complaints showed an
increase most likely due to the number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to lack of operator
availability.

1.C.3.a

The purpose of RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit Function is to provide
independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and
improve RTD’s processes. The mission of Internal and Information Systems Audit is to
enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective
assurance, advice, and insight. The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function
helps RTD accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control
processes. (Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing).
The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function will govern itself by adherence to
the mandatory elements of The Institute of Internal Auditors' International Professional
Practices Framework, including the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of
Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional
Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Definition of Internal Auditing. The Manager of
Internal and IT Audit will report periodically to Senior Management and the Board
regarding the function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.

Authority
The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will report functionally to the Board and
administratively (i.e., day-to-day operations) to the General Manager and CEO.
To establish, maintain, and assure that RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit
Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties, the Board will:
•
•
•
•

Approve the function’s charter.
Approve the risk-based Annual Audit Plan.
Receive communications from the Manager of Internal and IT Audit on the
function’s performance relative to its plan and other matters.

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will ensure that the Internal and Information Systems
Audit Function remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of all auditors to
carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of audit selection,
scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and report content. If the Manager of Internal and
IT Audit determines that independence or objectivity may be impaired in fact or
appearance, the details of impairment will be disclosed to appropriate parties.
All auditors will maintain an unbiased mental attitude that allows them to perform
engagements objectively and in such a manner that they believe in their work product,
that no quality compromises are made, and that they do not subordinate their judgment
on audit matters to others.
Auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities
audited. Accordingly, auditors will not implement internal controls, develop procedures,
install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair their
judgment, including:
•
•
•
•

year.

Initiating or approving transactions external to the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function

Information Systems Audit Function except to the extent that such employees have
been appropriately assigned to auditing teams or to otherwise assist internal
auditors.

responsibilities that fall outside of auditing, safeguards will be established to limit
impairments to independence or objectivity.

does not assume management responsibility.
Opportunities for improving the efficiency of governance, risk management, and control
processes may be identified during engagements. These opportunities will be

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and timing of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 7, 2017

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 5, 2017

Board Meeting Date: December 19, 2017

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment for the Supply
of 60 - 40' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise the contract option and amend contract 13FH-053 with Gillig LLC. for the purchase of 60 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare
components in an amount not to exceed $26,350,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Financial Sustainability to include asset management
and state of good repair, Bus Operations is continuing the process of replacing the aging and high
maintenance Orion and older Gillig buses.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a quantity of 60 additional 40’ transit buses. The new buses will replace 60 exiting buses
including older 30-foot and 40-foot Gilllig buses and the remaining year 2000 Orion 40-foot buses.
The transit buses to be replaced have exceeded their FTA service life. They are comprised of 14 2000Orion buses, which are now 17 years old and have accumulated on average 733,000 miles of stop-andgo transit service; 21 2005-Gillig buses, which are over 12 years old (the FTA useful life guideline for
40’ buses) and have accumulated on average 565,000 miles of service; and 25 30-foot 2006-Gillig
buses that have exceeded their FTA useful service life guideline of 10 years and have accumulated an
average of 524,120 miles of service. This requested bus purchase is included in the adopted SBP.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five-year period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary
price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 110
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
On February 17, 2015 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 64
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 40
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.

Packet Pg. 49

2.B.1

On March 28, 2017 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 15
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
This requested purchase of additional 60 Gillig 40’ transit buses will complete the 5-year contract with
Gillig.
DISCUSSION
The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. As
parts of our commitment to the disabled community for continued improvement of access, the buses
will feature enhanced seat layout to better accommodate passengers with disabilities and passengers
with large items such as walkers, shopping carts, baby strollers, etc. Their clean diesel engines will
meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the
existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a security
digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors and 37 passenger seats.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
quantity of 60-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$26,350,000. The funding for this project is included in the adopted 2018 RTD budget.

There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Gillig for the purchase
of 60-40’ transit buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it
would result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of
the project.

5311 Funding Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams
County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2018 and for amounts not to
exceed $379,677.00 for Boulder County, $373,346.00 for Adams County and $115,679.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU),
along with previous transit legislation, provided for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized, or
rural, areas. The section of the Act that addressed the provision of services in non-urbanized areas was
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Current
transportation authorizing legislation is known as the FAST Act (Fixing America’s Surface
Transportation).
Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision
of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal
grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $379,677.00 in 2018. RTD shall also contribute funding
to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount
not to exceed $373,346.00 in 2018.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $115,679.00.00 in 2018.
5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations
have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreements is warranted. Performance
will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not

Packet Pg. 52

2.B.2

warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into
conformance. The provision of 5311 service through Q3 of 2017 has resulted in monthly performance
that has ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding that
has ranged from approximately $1.08 to approximately $5.62 (subsidy reflects only the RTD
contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly performance averaged 3.5 passengers per
hour in 2016 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performed at approximately 1.5 passengers per hour.
Call-n-Ride performed at an average cost per passenger boarding of $17.92 and Access-a-Ride
performed at an average cost per passenger boarding of $44.60 in 2016.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2018 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2. Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

City of Boulder Hop Funding Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at
Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2018 and is for
an amount not to exceed $1,430,742.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday. RTD staff has been working with the City staff on a redesign of
HOP service for implementation in 2018.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,430,742.00 in 2018.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will
confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through 3rd Quarter in 2017 resulted in 22.3 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP
passenger boarding of $1.78. For comparison, RTD suburban local services performed at an average of
18.7 boardings per hour in 2016 with an average cost of $7.60 per passenger boarding. RTD urban local
services performed at an average of 26.7 boardings per hour and $5.47 average cost in 2016.

herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service
so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
2. Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

DRCOG Vanpool Funding Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is
for calendar year 2018 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the
costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had previously
experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van acquisition,
difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing activities. In
order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of
2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed
that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers

Packet Pg. 56

2.B.4

and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service has grown
from 11 to 113 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.5 riders per van and the fleet is at 77% capacity.
Vanpool performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations
have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreement is warranted. DRCOG vanpool
performance through October in 2017 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat
of approximately $3.61. For comparison, the cost per passenger boarding for RTD fixed route service in
2016 ranged from an average of $5.19 for CBD local routes to an average of $7.60 cost per passenger
boarding for suburban local service and an average of $6.58 cost per passenger boarding for regional
service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program were budgeted in the approved 2018 RTD
budget. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or
extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2. Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting and/or increased demand on RTD to provide
service in lower population density, outlying areas.

Englewood Art Shuttle Funding Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
Art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2018 and is for
an amount not to exceed $336,208.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the Art shuttle
because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the
management and marketing of the Art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related
expenses. The Art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood.
The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the Art shuttle
charged a RTD fare.
The Art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The Art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15) to
twenty (20) minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 649.0 boardings per day or 26.8 passengers per
hour through the first three (3) quarters of 2017. In 2018, the Art Shuttle will change its name and
become the Englewood Trolley.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the Art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $336,208 in 2018.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the Art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of Art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2017 resulted in 26.8 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per Art shuttle passenger trip of $1.81. For comparison, RTD suburban local fixed
route service performed at an average of 18.7 boardings per hour in 2016 with an average cost of

Packet Pg. 58

2.B.5

$7.60 per passenger boarding. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the Art
shuttle.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the Art shuttle were included in the approved 2018 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the Art shuttle circulator bus
service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2. Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the Art shuttle circulator service.

Exercise Option for On-Vehicle Advertising
Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to exercise the one-time extension with Lamar Advertising of Denver [Lamar] for
the two-year period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019.
Under the terms of the
recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $3.4 million in 2018
and $3.4 million in 2019 or 2) seventy percent of net sales, whichever is greater.
BACKGROUND
On October 28, 2014, RTD awarded Lamar the On-vehicle Advertising Contract 14DO005.This contract
provided for an initial three-year agreement with a two-year option for 2018 and 2019.
DISCUSSION
Lamar has performed well under the terms of the agreement. Regular operations to sell, produce, install,
maintain and remove on-vehicle advertising are proceeding in an acceptable manner. Consistent
communication between RTD and Lamar occurs to address any questions or challenges. Lamar has
coordinated with RTD and Denver Transit Partners on the implementation of advertising on commuter rail
service initiated during the primary three-year term. Lamar delivers the minimum revenue guarantee to
RTD at the beginning of each contract year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In the subsequent two-year, the minimum revenue will be $3.4M each year. Lamar has delivered the
minimum revenue guarantee each year without incident.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award the contract extension to Lamar Advertising of Denver for the two-year period January 1,
2018 through December 31, 2019 for the exclusive sale of exterior advertising on RTD buses,
light rail and commuter rail vehicles and for the non-exclusive sale of interior advertising on RTD
buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles. Under the terms of this alternative, Lamar would
remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $3.4 million in 2018 and $3.4 million in 2019 or
2) seventy percent of net sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff recommendation.
2. Do not award a contract extension to Lamar Advertising of Denver and reissue the RFP. This
alternative is not recommended because 1) Lamar has performed under the terms of the
agreement in the initial three-years of the agreement and 2) the contract minimum revenue
guarantees proposed by Lamar exceeded the minimum guarantee required in the RFP and there is
no indication that a higher revenue figure could be obtained.
