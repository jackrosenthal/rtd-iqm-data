Subject:

Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental
Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for the
BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro
Rail Line

General

Board Meeting Date: February 17, 2015

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law
and to purchase insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims
arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL,
including but not limited to environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out
of the use of automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under
the Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the
Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
BACKGROUND
On November 7, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General Manager to enter into all
contracts necessary to implement design and construction of the NMRL. The corridor alignment
approved in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the NMRL includes right of way that RTD
needs to acquire from BNSF. BNSF has consistently maintained that it will not sell right of way for
passenger rail service if it will increase BNSF’s liability exposure. A requirement for RTD’s acquisition of
right of way from BNSF for the Gold Line and first electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Line was
that RTD agree to waive governmental immunity, purchase insurance and indemnify BNSF to the same
extent now required for the NMRL. The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits a
governmental entity’s liability for certain types of claims both as to dollar amount and matters for which
it could be liable. Waiver is permitted under state law so long as the waiver is by the governing body in
advance of claims and to a specified amount. RTD passed very similar resolutions for the prior BNSF
acquisitions. RTD also passed very similar resolutions for the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) for acquisition
of right of way for the NMRL and UP Property on the East, Gold and West Corridors.
DISCUSSION
RTD is acquiring property and entering into a Construction and Maintenance Agreement with BNSF for
approximately two and a half miles of right of way on the NMRL. RTD and BNSF trains will operate in
close proximity to one another. BNSF will not sell property for the use of passenger rail and thereby
increase its exposure to risk without indemnification. Federal law limits liability for passenger rail
accidents to $200 million per occurrence at the present time, and state law limits exposure to punitive
damages for both RTD and BNSF. RTD must acquire and maintain insurance in the amounts shown,

subject to review by the RTD and BNSF approximately every five years as a condition of RTD operations.
If RTD fails to obtain and maintain insurance and indemnify BNSF, RTD may be precluded from
operations in the shared portion of the corridor.
RTD will be required to maintain insurance and to indemnify BNSF for all claims for which BNSF is or
may be liable that would not have occurred but for RTD’s use of the corridor for passenger service,
regardless of fault. Responsibility for claims for which both parties may be liable are allocated after start
of RTD operations. Neither party may bring claims against the other. RTD will be required to obtain and
maintain Railroad Protective Liability insurance in the amount of at least $200,000,000 (two hundred
million dollars) or such greater amounts as may be allowed by federal statutes setting liability caps for
passenger rail accidents. Worker’s compensation, auto coverage, property damage and pollution liability
coverage are required. RTD must indemnify BNSF for claims its employees make if such claims are the
result of RTD’s use of the corridor. RTD is required to waive governmental immunity up to the limits of
coverage.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is already obligated to acquire coverage for both BNSF and UP in all shared passenger and freight
corridors under previous contracts and resolutions. Insurance is included in the Owner Controlled
Insurance Program for the NMRL. Operations phase coverage will cost only slightly more to RTD than if
this resolution were not passed, because coverage must be provided for portions of the West, and
virtually all of the East, Gold and Northwest Rail Corridors. Funding for the operations phase coverage
will be provided each year as part of the annual operating budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign
immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and
use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL, including but not limited to
environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of
automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the
Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the
Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
2.

Do not pass the attached Resolution. This will require an alternative alignment for the NMRL and
significant cost and time delays to the project. This is not recommended.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION No. ___, SERIES OF 2015
Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for the
BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro Rail Line
Whereas, On November 7, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General
Manager to enter into all contracts necessary to implement design and construction of the
North Metro Rail Corridor (NMRL) within the authorized project budget; and
Whereas, the alignment approved in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared
for the NMRL includes right of way that RTD needs to acquire from the BNSF Railway
Company; and
Whereas, the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits both RTD and
BNSF’s liability for punitive damages arising out of the use of the railroad right of way
shared with or acquired from a railroad for passenger rail services; and
Whereas, the CGIA limits RTD’s liability but allows a governmental entity to waive
immunity otherwise available up to an amount specified by the entity; and
Whereas, a condition of sale from the BNSF is that RTD acquire insurance,
indemnify BNSF and waive governmental immunity that would otherwise be available
under Colorado law for any incidents, accidents or losses occurring in the shared
BNSF/RTD portion of the NMRL alignment; and
Whereas, the BNSF requires RTD to obtain and maintain insurance for so long as
the BNSF operates in the shared corridor, to waive immunity and to indemnify it for any
claims and losses caused by use of the shared corridor for the construction or maintenance
of RTD improvements and the operation of passenger rail service and to apportion liability
in circumstances not covered by RTD indemnity obligations; and
Whereas, the CGIA allows RTD to waive limits under the CGIA and to indemnify
third parties for liabilities other than punitive or exemplary damages.
Now therefore be it resolved that:
The RTD Board of Directors agrees to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to the
extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying BNSF for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to
be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL including but not limited to environmental liability
claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of automobiles, worker
protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the Federal Employer’s
Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that such limits shall be the limits to which
immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
