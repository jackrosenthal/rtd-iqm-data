UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

Authorization of Fiscal Authority to the General Manager for the I-225 Rail Line
Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors (“Board”) pass the attached Resolution Number __, Series 2012, to provide
the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, real
property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for the I-225 Rail Line
Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining project budget of $605.3 million,
and to amend the project to accept third party contributions without further board
approval. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts;
work orders; change orders and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition
and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are
necessary or advisable to complete the I-225 Rail Line within the scope of the I-225
Project budget and to accept grants or other contributions and to increase the project
budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work.

B.

Request for authorization to submit to DRCOG an amendment to the 2035
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize submittal of an amendment to the 2035 Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP), including a supporting financial plan, to the Denver
Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) in August, 2012. Because the RTD
Board of Directors decided not to pursue a sales and use tax election in 2012,
an amendment to the RTP is necessary to meet the federal requirement that the
RTP be “fiscally constrained.” Not having a “fiscally constrained” RTP could
negatively impact federal funding for transportation projects throughout the
region.
The financial plan for the RTP amendment assumes no additional sales and use
tax will be available to fund the FasTracks program prior to 2035. Projects
included in the amendment are consistent with the FasTracks Guiding Principles
and were selected because they represent current commitments of program
funds, or they are strong candidates for leveraging public/private funds and/or
receiving federal grants. The projects included in the financial plan include:





West Rail Line: Complete 2013
Denver Union Station: Complete 2015
I-225: Complete 2016
Eagle Project: Complete 2016
o East Rail Line to DIA

Southwest Corridor Extension – UP Rail Line Relocation: Complete 2015
US 36 BRT:
o $120M for Managed Lanes to 88 th Street: 2012-2014
o Table Mesa Pedestrian Bridge: Complete 2012
o $15M for Managed Lanes to Table Mesa: 2014/2015
o Remaining RTD funding commitment available: 2030-2035
North Metro:
o Construction to National Western Stock Show: 2017
o Complete to 72 nd using local funds: 2030-2035
Southeast Corridor Extension: Complete assuming 50% federal grant
funding 2030-2035

The RTP Amendment represents a snapshot in time and can change in the
future as new opportunities arise. Since a full SB 208 Report will not be
developed until February 2014, the additional time will provide the RTD
Board, staff, and stakeholders the opportunity to work together to consider
the options and make collaborative decisions regarding the build out of the
full FasTracks Plan.
XIII.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
C. Approval of Contract Award to AECOM for the final design of North Metro Rail Line
Segments 1 and 2
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve an eighteen -month
professional services contract award to AECOM to serve as the Final Civil
Engineering Design Contractor for the North Metro Rail Line, from Denver Union
Station (DUS) to 72 nd Avenue Station, for an amount not to exceed
$10,400,000 for the years 2012 through 2014. Funds for the award are
contained in the amended 2012 FasTracks Budget.
