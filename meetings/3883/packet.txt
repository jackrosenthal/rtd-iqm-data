Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Customer and Community Survey Results and Data
Analysis

June 23, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
John McKay, Chief of Staff
PRESENTATION LENGTH
35 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board on August 10, 2021. The
Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance.
RTD contracts with a third-party survey consultancy to conduct annual surveys to gauge agency
performance related to the Strategic Priorities of Customer Excellence and Community Value. In April
2025, the consultancy administered surveys of community members as well as customers utilizing
RTD’s bus, rail, and paratransit services.
DISCUSSION
Survey Methodology:
•

Community Value: The survey was administered from Tuesday, April 8 through Sunday, April 20,
2025. With a target sample size of 400 responses, surveys were mailed to a random sample of
US postal service addresses within the RTD service area. The results were monitored to maintain
demographic distribution in proportion to the region. Upon the conclusion of the survey, 770
completed responses were received.

•

Customer Excellence – Bus and Rail Customers. To gauge the agency’s 2025 performance related
to Customer Excellence, survey teams were deployed throughout the transit system Monday,
April 7 through Monday, April 14, 2025. The consultancy’s sampling plan was inclusive of the
entire service area and included all bus routes and light and commuter rail lines. With a target
sample size of 1,200, the surveys were conducted via intercepts of individuals utilizing transit
services. Upon the conclusion of the survey, 1,821 completed responses were gathered.

•

Customer Excellence Survey – Paratransit: Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand – The survey
ran from Monday, April 7 through Wednesday, April 23, 2025. Sampling for the paratransit
customer survey was derived from active, eligible, registered customers who were contacted by a
combination of text message, email, and mail for survey distribution. The target sample size was

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

400, and 440 completed responses were received.
Survey Accessibility
All surveys were available in English and Spanish. Language assistance services were made available in
an additional 20 languages. For customers who are blind or visually impaired, assistance was made
available through the agency’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office to complete the surveys.
Customer Characteristics:
Respondents are representative of the Denver metro area. Customer demography varied by service
mode. For example, paratransit customers are most likely to identify as White or Caucasian women over
65 years of age, whereas bus and rail (collectively, fixed-route) customers are more likely to identify as
White or Caucasian males ages 18 to 39. Among both fixed-route and paratransit customers,
approximately 30-40% identify as Hispanic, Spanish, or Latino/a/x or Black/African American.
Among respondents, 63% of bus customers, 40% of rail customers, 86% of Access-a-Ride, and 90% of
Access-on-Demand customers reported household incomes of less than $50,000. Travel to medical
appointments was the primary reason Access-a-Ride (52% of respondents) and Access-on-Demand
(41% of respondents) utilized the services, whereas approximately 50% of fixed-route customers
traveled for work as their primary reason for transit use. Among fixed-route customers, 71% of bus
customers and 59% of rail customers report using transit three days or more per week, and 78% and
65% of bus and rail customers, respectively, report that they are transit reliant.
Key Takeaways
Perception of Community Value, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Customer Satisfaction. Community
impressions of RTD’s personal value and value to the region have improved year over year and are
significantly higher than national averages. Results show that 86% of community members believe that
RTD provides value to the region, and 73% believe that RTD provides value to them personally. In
comparison to national averages, RTD’s value ratings for community value and personal value are 20%
and 42% greater, respectively.
Increasing 36 points year over year, RTD’s Community NPS is 14, which is 75 points higher than the
national average. For reference, NPS is a measure of customer satisfaction with a product or service.
Customers are asked to respond to the question of whether they would recommend the product or
service to friends or relatives on a 10-point scale. The score is calculated by subtracting the percentage
of individuals responding with a rating of 0-6 (detractors) from those responding with a rating of 9 or 10
(promoters).

Compared to 2024, Customer NPS results are higher for fixed-route service and for Access-on-Demand
service and slightly lower for Access-a-Ride service. The overall Customer NPS is 37, meaning the

agency has considerably more promoters than detractors, and bus and rail scores remain well above
national averages. National benchmark data is not available for paratransit services for purposes of this

customer segments, 76% of bus customers and 75% of rail customers are satisfied or very satisfied
with RTD’s services in 2025, up from 68% and 63%, respectively, in 2024. RTD’s customers are 20%
more satisfied with bus service and 19% more satisfied with rail service than national averages.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025-26 GM-CEO Short-term Goals

June 23, 2025

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO)
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the performance assessment framework adopted by the Board during the monthly Board
meeting held on January 30, 2024, the Board is responsible for motivating, assessing, and rewarding
the agency’s GM/CEO in relation to short-term and long-term performance. In performance periods prior
to 2025, the GM/CEO’s short-term performance has been assessed on an annual basis.
The attainment of short-term goals directly tied to agency Strategic Initiatives is a critical element of the
GM/CEO’s annual performance, as is performance related to core job duties and values.
On December 4, 2023, the Board adopted a fifth amendment to the contract to adjust the Board’s
annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which the GM/CEO will be evaluated in the coming
year from December 31 to January 31.
On December 10, 2024, the Board adopted an eighth amendment to the contract, which included the
following terms, among other provisions:
•

•

•
•

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,
and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period
Beginning January 1, 2025, the Board must meet with GM/CEO Johnson each quarter to discuss
her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals
For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is not eligible for a Cost-of-Living Adjustment; however the Board will endeavor
to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the Compensation Philosophy

1.C.2

In May 2025, upon request from Chair Bouquet, the Board Office solicited from Board members their
feedback regarding their thoughts on potential agency priorities for the short-term planning horizon.
During the Board’s retreat held on Saturday, June 7, 2025, the Board and GM/CEO Johnson discussed
several themes derived from the feedback garnered, which subsequently informed the short-term goals
identified in this Recommended Action.
DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, the purpose of this Recommended Action is to align the committee
around the proposed short-term SMART goals and associated weighting for the performance period
commencing November 9, 2025, and continuing through November 8, 2026 (2025-26 performance
period).
The working draft proposed goals for the 2025-26 performance period are as follows:
Short-term Goal 1 – Customer Experience/Welcoming Transit Environment: No later than
October 2, 2026, increase overall customer satisfaction by 5% for both RTD’s fixed-route bus
service and fixed-route rail service (50% of goal); to increase favorable customer survey
responses by 5% from CY2025 to CY2026 in relation to survey questions pertaining to
customers’ perception of feeling safe and secure aboard light rail vehicles.
Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to consistently deliver high-quality customer
service and improve performance metrics related to overall customer satisfaction as well as to
promote a welcoming transit environment.
According to customer survey data garnered in April 2025, overall satisfaction with RTD’s service
delivery stood at 76% for bus and 75% for combined rail service. Paratransit service received
very high customer satisfaction ratings, 86% and 96% for Access-a-Ride and Access-onDemand, respectively.
Leveraging data from the 2025 Customer Excellence survey for fixed-route services, 69% of light
rail customers, reported feeling safe and secure while aboard rail vehicles, up from 62% in 2024.
A key driver analysis of the survey responses identified perception of personal security aboard
light rail vehicles as a key opportunity area to increase overall satisfaction with RTD’s services.
In comparison, a significantly higher proportion of commuter rail customers, 82%, reported
feeling safe and secure while aboard rail vehicles, up from 62% in 2024, indicating that prior
efforts to create and maintain a welcoming transit environment have yielded significant
improvements.

Short-term Goal 2 – Ridership: To increase systemwide boardings by 3% from the period
commencing October 1, 2025, and continuing through September 30, 2026.

Packet Pg. 61

1.C.2

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics tied to
community perceptions of the value RTD provides to the Denver metro region and of RTD’s
provision of service to major activity centers, as well as the State’s visionary ridership increase
goal of 6%.
RTD continues to optimize service levels and is incrementally approaching the level of service
delivery contemplated in the System Optimization Plan (SOP), with a planning horizon running
2022-2027.
Annual boardings totaled 65,230,065 in 2024, a slight increase from the 65,175,290 boardings
seen in 2023. The Board has established a 2025 short-term performance goal for the GM/CEO to
increase boardings by 3% from the period commencing October 1, 2024, and ending September
30, 2025. The goal for the 2025-26 performance period builds upon the GM/CEO’s performance
goal related to increased ridership for the performance period commencing January 28, 2025,
and continuing through October 15, 2025.
Short-term Goal 3 – Reliability: No later than October 1, 2026, to complete rail reconstruction
work within budget for the rail segment between the West Colfax Avenue and 7th Street
intersection and the Denver Convention Center (50% of goal); to increase by 5% the
percentage of fixed-route bus and light rail customers who agree or strongly agree that transit
vehicles usually run on time (50% of goal).
Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to enhance system reliability and to improve
performance metrics related to customers’ perception of service frequency, the timely arrival of
vehicles, and travel time.
The Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project commenced construction in 2024. Phases 2-4 of the
project are anticipated to recommence in Q1 2025, with related rail reconstruction work taking
place commencing September 2025 for the Kalamath light rail segment. Phase 3 of the project
involves the rail segment between the West Colfax Avenue and 7th Street intersection and the
Denver Convention Center. Note that the agency announced at the inception of the project in
2024 that the numbering of Phases 2 through 4 was not intended to imply the order in which
they would be completed.
Leveraging data from the 2025 Customer Excellence survey for fixed-route services, a key driver
analysis identified service frequency, the timely arrival of transit vehicles, and overall travel time
as three opportunity areas to increase overall satisfaction with RTD’s services, with service
frequency being identified by customers of all fixed-route modes as being the most critically
important element. Maintaining assets in a state of good repair is critical to ensuring consistent,
frequent, reliable service.
