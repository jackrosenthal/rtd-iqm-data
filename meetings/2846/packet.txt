Budget Actions for T2 and O and M Cost Model

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the
Operating Reserve to the Planning expense budget to fully fund a contract award
for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The
Board previously approved all funding for this contract last fall when they
adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the
$1,420,000 DRCOG Regional Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board
in December 2018. The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating
Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended
Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant funds received and local funds,
which were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the
Operating Reserve to the Finance and Administration expense budget for
development of an updated operating and maintenance cost model to support
the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort. The funds are being temporarily taken out of
the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019
Amended Budget with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved
by the Board last fall.
This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management

General

Board Meeting Date: February 26, 2019

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the second and final option year (2019) of a three-year contract for the
annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for
$405,250.73. Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2019 Adopted expense budget
for Capital Programs.
This action addresses Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services of the General Manager’s
goals for 2019.

BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised process, and the
contract was awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in
April of 2017. The first option year to this contract was approved by an RTD Board Action on February
27, 2018. Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very
good contractor. The current base contract value and proposed amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
$ 200,000.00
$ 1,061,282.25
Second option year (2019) $ 405,250.73
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and both option years (2018 & 2019) =
$1,466,532.98
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 5

2.11.A

This second amendment (2nd year option) will increase the contract by $ 405,250.73, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $ 1,466,532.98.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $405,250.73 funding for this Board Action is included in the 2019 Adopted expense budget for
Capital Programs.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute all documents necessary to award a Contract Amendment to initiate the
second and final option year (2019) of a three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements
& Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $405,250.73. Funding for this
contract amendment is included in the 2019 Adopted expense budget for Capital Programs.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second and
final option year (2019) year of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements
& Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for
Bid (IFB) for this year’s construction work. This is not recommended because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned 2019 street improvements
c. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
d. The 2019 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
e. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Award of “Group 28” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First Transit for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 28.” This contract is for three years, with
two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$81,174,070.00; the option year 1 amount is $29,386,941.00; and the option year 2 amount is
$30,671,864.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $141,232,875.00. In
addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be
$10,200,929.00 for the initial 3-year contract term; $3,547,094.00 for option year 1; and
$3,618,757.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is
$17,366,779.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit
service and fuel is $158,599,654.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On October 2, 2018, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 18-DH-039 named “Group 28” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 28” service package
replaces “Group 24”, which will expire in 2019. The service package consists of 118 buses
operating 38 routes providing approximately 329,437 revenue hours per year. A summary of the
routes included in “Group 28” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals
were due on November 2, 2018. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for
providing fixed-route service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided
transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated
to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

2.11.B

DISCUSSION
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 18-DH-039 to provide “Group 28” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on August 25, 2019.
PROCUREMENT
One (1) proposal was received from First Transit in response to RFP 18-DH-039 for the Provision of
“Group 28” Public Transportation Services. Five additional companies expressed interest in the
solicitation, however, these firms elected not to submit proposals primarily due to the following
reasons:
All Aboard America Holding - After reviewing the work scope, All Aboard America Holding
determined this type of service required resources they are currently lacking.
Keolis Transit Services – Keolis Transit Services found the 30 day turnaround on the RFP timeline to
be too limiting.
National Express - The difficulty of finding an appropriate facility to locate their operations was too
great an obstacle for National Express to prepare a competitive proposal.
RATP Dev USA – RATP Dev USA indicated that finding a facility in the Denver market is nearly
impossible. The incumbent has a definite advantage so they chose not to bid.
Transdev – Transdev had already committed to other existing clients for proposals for work that
were at the RFP stage, so Transdev chose to pass on bidding on the “Group 28” services.
In response to the input received from the Prospective bidders, RTD staff has made the following
changes to the fixed route bus operation RFP process.
1. All Fixed Route bus service procurements will be placed on the upcoming RFP announcement
page six (6) months in advance of the RFP being released.
2. RFPs for fixed route bus service packages will be advertised for 60 days instead of 30 days.
The First Transit proposal was evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and
safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored the proposal based on a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and safety record. The technical
evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Greg Smith,
Manager, Competitive Services; Steve Gieske, General Superintendent, Maintenance; Tim Lucero,
General Superintendent, Street Operations; Loradeane Clinkenbeard, Manager, Bus Operator Training;
and Crystal Kirklin, Technician, Contracted Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Brittany Eroen, Compliance Officer,
SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored the Procurement Department staff.

Packet Pg. 8

2.11.B

The following is a summary of the strong points of the First Transit “Group 28” proposal which
support the recommendation of contract award:
Bus Operator Wages. First Transit’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage increased from $18.50/hour to $19.00/hour (RTD starting wage for operators
effective March 1, 2019 is $19.98/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage
levels. RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and
retaining qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide First Transit the opportunity
to offer a more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators
and result in improved service for our passengers.
Mechanic Wages. First Transit’s C level mechanic wage is currently $21.00/hour (RTD starting
wage for the equivalent of a C level mechanic is $25.32 effective March 1, 2019). First Transit
anticipates reviewing mechanic wages during 2019 to respond to changing market conditions.
Dedicated On-site Recruiter. This new full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of
bus operators and maintenance personnel for the First Transit Commerce City location.
Enhanced Quality Control. First Transit will assign a corporate team to work with the local
management team to identify causes and potential modifications to improve on-time performance and
other performance metrics.
Maintenance Program. First Transit will add one additional Shop Supervisor to assist in oversight of
daily maintenance activities. Mechanics will be required to complete 40 hours of initial training and
40 hours of skills enhancement training annually. In addition, the maintenance department is certified
as both an Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) and Silver Lean shop. The Commerce City division
has 17 mechanics that are ASE certified and 6 mechanics that are Master Technician certified.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit Commerce City division
consistently meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed
and nurtured positive and productive relationships with Commerce City and surrounding governments
and communities. The team has long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no
disruption of service when transitioning from the previous “Group 24” contract to the new “Group
28” contract.

all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: First Transit raises awareness of passenger safety
through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000
miles.

Packet Pg. 10

2.11.B

On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: First Transit places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: First Transit continues to understand the impact new operators, construction
detours, and traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 24” contract, First Transit
worked in conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They continue to
work on this by identifying low performing routes and assigning street supervisors to campaign the
routes and to meet with operators to discuss factors that impact their ability to run on time.
Schedule issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: First Transit continually exceeds the goal in this area by
completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner,
monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active
approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: First Transit’s performance in this category reflects the difficulties
experienced throughout the RTD district in the recent past due to operator shortages which resulted
in a high number of “bus late” and “bus did not show” complaints. First Transit continues to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to
reduce the number of customer complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 28” service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent increase in bus operator wages by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
also similarly address labor challenges by increasing other wages. RTD also factored a 3% increase
in costs for inflation. First Transit’s proposed price below is based upon a negotiated best and final
offer.
RTD Competitive Services total five-year estimate for the “Group 28” service package was
$142,954,280. First Transit’s proposed total five-year price was $141,232,875 or $1,721,405 less
than the RTD estimate. First Transit’s proposed price includes increases in inflation, training costs,
wages, and increases in maintenance costs associated with the aging 2005-2007 Gillig bus fleet.
Note: Bus Operator starting wages will increase from $18.50/hour to $19.00/hour. C level Mechanic
starting wages are currently $21.00/hour. (First Transit anticipates a review of C level Mechanic
wages to respond to changing market conditions)

provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $156,698,258, which is $15,465,383 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by First Transit. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected
wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixedroute services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the
“Group 28” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and
maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services.
The First Transit total five-year proposed price represents a $15,465,383 (10%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 28” - Proposer Service Cost

fuel is $17,366,779.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route
transit service and fuel is $158,599,654.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
2)

Resolicit the “Group 28” service package. This is not recommended as the proposal process has
resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate and is less expensive than the estimated cost for RTD to provide these services
internally.

Subject:

Budget Actions for T2
Model

Date: February 6, 2019

and O and M Cost

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Planning
expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive
Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The Board previously approved all funding for this contract last fall when they
adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the $1,420,000 DRCOG
Regional Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December 2018. The funds are being
temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the
2019 Amended Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant funds received and local funds,
which were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Finance and
Administration expense budget for development of an updated operating and maintenance cost
model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort. The funds are being temporarily taken out of
the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget
with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.
This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION
Preparation of a systems optimization plan/ comprehensive operations analysis is one important
element of the Board adopted 2019 Task Goal #4 (Address future Transportation Needs and
Methods.) The Board directed effort will be an integral component of RTD’s Transportation
Transformation initiative, as the District evolves as both a mobility integrator and public transit
provider. The Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan) is anticipated to
provide guidance on future RTD services, to complement FasTracks, and to chart a course that
optimizes existing and future FasTracks infrastructure and determines what other future investments
are needed. The plan is intended to provide a vision for RTD’s existing rail system, focus on
ancillary services such as multi-modal first/last mile connections, maximize FasTracks investments,
address staffing-related challenges, evaluate long-term parking needs, determine the locations nature
of future bus maintenance facility(s), consider fleet electrification and review RTD’s boundaries. The
effort also will include a re-examination of RTD’s financial planning processes to determine how RTD
can improve them to best meet the changing service and infrastructure needs of the District in a

Packet Pg. 16

2.12.C

fiscally sustainable manner. The T2 Comp Plan, was funded over two years in the 2019 -2024 MidTerm Financial Plan that was adopted by the Board this past fall. The 2019 Adopted Budget
included $1,260,000 for consultant services, with an additional $1,837,000 in inflated dollars
programmed in 2020 in the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
After the adoption of the 2019 Adopted Budget, RTD received an additional $1,420,000 for the T2
Comp Plan through a federal grant competitively awarded by DRCOG, bringing the total available
funding for the project to $4,517,000. The grant funds will be available to RTD in October 2019.
Staff is looking to begin a procurement process for consultant services to complete the T2 Comp
Plan. This process would lead to selection of a consultant in April 2019, with the Board of Directors
approving the resulting contract at the May 2019 Board meeting.
Staff expects the effort to span approximately two years, and these funds were programmed in the
2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan in 2019 and 2020 to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order t o issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because RTD would not be able to stop work at the end of 2019 if the Board were
to decide not to appropriate the 2020 funds in the 2020 budget. The budget transfer for the T2
Comp Plan will allow the Board to award the contract in May 2019, with all activities associated
with the plan completed by the middle of 2021. Thus, RTD will be able to implement all of the near term elements of the plan, along with the revised financial planning process, in time for adoption of
the 2022 budget. Total funding for the T2 Comp Plan is $4,517,000, consisting of $1,420,000 of
grant funds and $3,097,000 of RTD local funds.
A significant element of the fiscal sustainability evaluation is determining the costs of potential
future service and mobility elements, and comparing those costs to the future cost of providing
service under RTD’s current service level. During the preparation of the scope of work for the T2
Comp Plan, staff determined that the current operating and maintenance cost forecasting tools
would need to be refined and enhanced in order to accomplish this objective. Staff also determined
that it would be better to issue a separate contract to develop these forecasting tools, rather than
including it in the overall T2 Comp Plan project scope. This will allow RTD to engage a firm with
specific expertise in operating and maintenance cost forecasting, and provide RTD with tools that
can be used for other planning and budgeting efforts beyond the scope and time horizon of th e T2
Comp Plan effort. The O&M cost model would be funded with $200,000 of RTD local funds from
the overall $4,517,000 T2 project budget mentioned in the paragraph above.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. The local funds were approved in the 2019-2024 MidTerm Financial Plan to be expended in 2020. RTD will receive additional grant funds through
DRCOG to cover any costs not originally included in the Mid-Term Financial Plan. These revenues
will be included in the 2019 Amended Budget and will be used to replenish the Operating Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Plan ning
expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the Transportation Transformation
Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The Board previously approved all funding for this contract
last fall when they adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the
$1,420,000 DRCOG Regional Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December

2018. The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue
and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant
funds received and local funds, which were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Finance
and Administration expense budget for development of an updated operating and maintenance
cost model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort. The funds are being temporarily taken
out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended
Budget with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at this
time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2019 Amended Budget. This action is not
recommended since it will delay the procurement process, contract award, and Notice to Proceed
by at least four months. Given the 24-month projected schedule for completion of the plan and
the need to coordinate short-term implementation with the annual budget cycle, this means that
RTD would not see all the elements of the plan implemented until 2023.

Board of Directors

Date: February 7, 2019

Requested
by:

Doug Tisdale, Board Chair

Date:
Subject:

Board Meeting Date: January 29, 2019
Revised Committee Charters

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors that the Board approve a motion to adopt the
attached revised charters of the Board’s standing committees.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
The principal roles each of the Board’s standing committees are briefly described in the Board Bylaws.
The Board further defines the scope, composition, responsibilities, and requirements of each committee
by way of a committee charter. Each of the Board’s standing committees was created as the Board
deemed necessary to guide the business needs of the agency. As such the charters were created over a
span of years, and certain provisions contained in one committee’s charter may be absent or different
from another.
DISCUSSION
The proposed revisions attempt to harmonize the provisions of the Board’s committee charters for
purposes of reasonable uniformity and consistency across all charters. Additionally the name of the
“Government Relations Committee” has been changed to “Communications & Government Relations
Committee” by request of the Board in order to provide an avenue for periodic reporting to the Board
from the Communications Department.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the revisions to the Board’s standing committee charters to bring their provisions in line
with one another.
2. To reject the revisions to the currently adopted charters.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the revised committee charters.

Board. For convenience of reference, those which are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those which are adopted by virtue of the delegated
authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant
of power, duty, or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Doug Tisdale, Board Chair

Date:
Subject:

Date: February 7, 2019

Board Meeting Date: February 26, 2019
Amended Board Operating Guidelines

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors that the Board approve a motion to adopt the
attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2019, along with the associated revised Board Operating
Guidelines governing specific aspects of the conduct of business by the Board and its members.
Specifically the guidelines address governance policy-setting, meeting efficiency, communication,
collaboration, and cooperation.
Furthermore, the Chair recommends that the Board renew annually, at the first meeting of the Board
each year, its commitment to uphold the principles memorialized in the revised Board Operating
Guidelines and to amend the guidelines periodically as necessary to reflect current best practices.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
In 2014, the Board adopted a resolution indicating its desire to operate in a considerate, thorough, and
effective manner, to respect the ideas and opinions of all Board members, and to be open and
transparent in the conduct of its business. Accompanying that resolution was a series of amended Board
Operating Guidelines, initially adopted following a Board retreat in 2008, which outlined certain
commitments and values of the Board and identified specific steps to enhance the Board’s effectiveness
moving forward.
DISCUSSION
The revised Board Operating Guidelines incorporate the 2014 guidelines as amended, as well as ground
rules adopted by the Board to govern the conduct of business during the retreats held in 2018. Also
incorporated by reference within the guidelines are a November 14, 2018 memorandum from RTD
General Counsel Rolf Asphaug identifying uncodified but long-established customs and practices
attendant to the official meetings of the Board and an August 22, 2018 memorandum from RTD General
Counsel Rolf Asphaug addressing confidentiality.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution and revised Board Operating Guidelines.

Packet Pg. 131

2.12.F

2. To reject the resolution and revised Board Operating Guidelines, in which case Resolution 004,
Series of 2014, and the associated operating guidelines adopted in the same year would remain in
full force and effect.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of either the resolution or the revised operating
guidelines.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES

Our Board is committed to transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value
when it focuses on and helps clarify high-level policy issues and plans, including the policies
that underpin capital and operating budgets. In setting high-level policies and plans, the
Board must understand the vision and mission of RTD and its priority objectives for coming
years as well as the long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position
RTD to be able to respond flexibly, responsibly, and transparently to unique factors as they
present, including the current organizational shift in focus from capital development to
operations and maintenance, challenges in optimizing service levels in order to meet
customer demands, and the introduction of disruptive transit technologies, in order better to
serve our constituents in new and varying ways. We appreciate that, as elected officials,
we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility to
each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both high-level policy-setting and executive
functions it must perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through our considered deliberations.
Thus we value openness in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our
conversations. We also place a premium on deliberations that are both efficient and
effective. Recognizing that issues will vary in their complexity, we value timely decisionmaking.
STEPS TO ENHANCE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
In order to enhance our effectiveness, we, the members of the RTD Board of Directors,
support the following efforts:


REGARDING GOVERNANCE POLICY-SETTING
o To recognize that a line exists between governance and management. As
such, the Board places a premium on conducting high-level discussions
regarding policy-setting and strategic planning at official meetings and
retreats and avoiding attempts to engage in management.
o To establish common goals, specific next steps for the near term, and a
long-term vision for the agency;
o To strive to effect organizational change through interactions with the
General Manager resulting from consensus action of the body, rather than
through the actions of individual Board members;
o To utilize the Chair, in the role of the designated representative of the Board,
as the first point of contact in Board communications with the General
Manager;

Attachment: Board Operating Guidelines - PENDING APPROVAL (3753 : Amended Board Operating Guidelines)

order to gain understanding, answer questions, and solve problems that can
be addressed individually rather than as a Board;
o To stay on topic and reserve additional or extraneous matters for later
discussion;
o To balance open discussion with timely decision making;
o To encourage committee chairs to take responsibility for guiding policy
discussions and give counsel to other members regarding questions within
their subject-matter expertise;
o To continue to utilize available technology and technology tools, which
enhance transparency and access to information and research, and to
continue to progress toward a paperless office environment;

stakeholders, patrons, and members of the public at large;
o To value openness of deliberation and dialogue and strive to espouse a
doctrine of “no surprises,” under which Board members, senior staff, and
major stakeholders are at least kept informed of progress, events, and
impending decisions and are consulted or involved in the decision-making
process;
o To encourage Director engagement during Executive Committee meetings,
so as to solve problems proactively and collaboratively before they are
addressed by the full Board;
o To recognize that effective Board members work with staff to seek subject
matter expertise;

experiences, perspectives, and styles. As such we value tolerance and
appreciation of the diversity of the Board’s membership and of their
opinions.

investment in FasTracks that will change the way in which transit is supplied in the Denver
metropolitan area for decades to come. including the current organizational shift in focus
from capital development to operations and maintenance, challenges in optimizing service
levels in order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of disruptive transit
technologies, in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. We

background material and packets, concise framing of policy issues, and being available
to brief and answer questions from Board members ahead of meetings.
4. In the interest of focused and efficient discussions, Board members commit to reading
appropriate material ahead of time and staying focused on the topic at hand.

at committee meetings rather than at full Board meetings.
6. The Board recognizes that our members come to RTD with different perspectives and
styles. We value tolerance and appreciation of the Board’s diversity.
7. The Board recognizes that technology and technological tools can enhance the Board
meeting experience by providing timely access to information and research relevant to
the topics at hand. The Board supports the use of electronic devices (i.e. iPhones,
Smart Phones, iPads and similar devices) during committee and Board meetings as long
as the use of these devices is not disruptive to the meeting and that Board members
provide the proper attention and courtesy to the people in attendance at the meeting.

8. We empower the Board Chair and the chairs of our committees to seek the appropriate
balance between open and thorough discussions and timely decisions to bring
discussions to closure and to remind Board members of our commitment to these
guidelines.
SPECIFIC NEXT STEPS
▪

Devote time for a Board discussion of criteria to be used in RTD RFPs, which should
include the appropriate level of due diligence the Board should perform on contracts.

▪

Define a date for a Board retreat designed to elicit and discuss some of the most
important policy concerns of Board members.

▪

Establish an annual Joint Board/Staff meeting or retreat that will focus exclusively on
policy guidance for the formulation of the operating and capital budget and the General
Manager’s Tactical Goals (i.e. strategic planning advance).

▪

Identify the types of issues that do not need to come before the Board (e.g., items
previously approved in the budget process or items that could be addressed solely by
staff).

▪

Have staff support the Board through its packet preparation with specific actions such
as:
▪ highlighting both the guiding policy issue and the decision being sought, and the
strategic goal that the action supports.
▪ limiting the volume of material (augmented by appended material if needed),
▪ bringing more complex items to the Board initially as discussion items and later
as decision items,
▪ providing packets sufficiently ahead of time so that when necessary Board
members can be in contact with either staff or constituents, and,
▪ when appropriate, setting forth options for Board consideration.

▪

Adopt flexible ground rules to guide Board discussions such as:
▪ avoid repeating arguments,
▪ focus on new points,
▪ avoid distracting non-verbal communications, and,
▪ limit comments when a decision of the Board is overwhelmingly clear.



Re-commit to these modified guidelines in 2014 and to ensure we are holding
ourselves accountable to the intent of these guidelines. Also make an accompanying
commitment to review their application on an as-needed basis from the date of this
adoption.

Attachment: Board Operating Guidelines - REDLINED (3753 : Amended Board Operating Guidelines)

Cellphones or devices with sound should be silenced with no vibrations. Voice calls
during the meetings are discouraged. Board members are reminded not to
communicate with one another via electronic devices at Board meetings, as all debate
should take place in public forum.

Re:

RTD Board of Directors Customs Relating to Board Meetings

This memorandum (1) discusses Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs
relating to RTD Board Meetings; and (2) sets forth RTD staff’s understanding of the
current Customs relating to RTD Board meetings. (There are no current Special Rules of
Order or Standing Rules adopted by the RTD Board.) Normal rules of order in the Bylaws
can be suspended or supplemented by special rules only by a two-thirds vote, and some
rules cannot be suspended.1 By contrast, standing rules and customs can be revised
going forward, or modified for any particular matter, by majority vote of the Board.2
This memo begins by explaining the purpose and authority for Special Rules of Order,
Standing Rules, and Customs. The meme then discusses the differences between Special
Rules of Order as opposed to Standing Rules and Customs. The memo then sets forth
RTD Board Meeting Customs as currently understood by RTD staff. These Customs
include such matters as:











Voting through RTD’s software system
Requesting the right to speak through RTD’s software system
Voting in Committee meetings by Directors attending by phone
Participation of RTD staff in Board and Committee discussions
Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
Location and authorization of public videotaping equipment
Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and questions
Recognition of retiring employees
What is “old” and “new” business
Placement of executive sessions when there are multiple Committee meetings

There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board adopts any Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.

Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs do not replace the RTD Bylaws
themselves, any provisions set forth in Robert’s Rules of Order, or any statutory
requirements such as laws governing executive sessions. Instead, RTD’s Board Bylaws
state:
“The current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, newly revised, shall govern
parliamentary procedure for the Board and its Committees except as herein provided
or as otherwise provided by law.”3
Robert’s Rules recognizes that neither it nor an organization’s bylaws can address all
procedures that are used for meetings. Robert’s Rules therefore recognizes the roles of
“special rules of order,” “standing rules” and “customs” in filling gaps not covered by an
organization’s bylaws or Robert’s Rules.4 (Robert’s 11th ed., pp. 18-19).
1. Special Rules of Order
Robert’s Rules explains Special Rules of Order as follows:
“The term rules of order refers to written rules of parliamentary procedure formally
adopted by … an organization. … The usual and preferable method … is … to place
in its bylaws a provision prescribing that the current edition of a specified and
generally accepted manual of parliamentary law shall be the organization’s
parliamentary authority, and then to adopt only such special rules of order as it finds
needed to supplement or modify rules contained in that manual.”5
Robert’s Rules notes that when, as with RTD, a source such as Robert’s Rules is
identified as the parliamentary authority “except as herein provided or as otherwise
provided by law,” a special rule of order cannot supersede anything within Robert’s
Rules except by a two-thirds vote.6 Certain rules of order can never be superseded –
such as fundamental principles of parliamentary law7 – but others can be suspended for
a particular matter by a two-thirds vote.
Unanimous consent is a good way to save time by suspending the rules, effectively
creating a one-time special rule. For example, a member may “ask unanimous consent
to suspend the rules” to adopt some non-controversial resolutions before proceeding to
3

RTD Bylaws, Art. XIII (11/29/2016).

Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 15.
6
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 17; and Sec. 25, pp. 260-267.
7
Examples of such fundamental principles includes the rule that allows only one question to be
considered at a time (note, however, that this rule does allow unanimous consent agendas); and
rules giving the right to vote to a nonmember or an absentee member. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25,
p. 263. The basic rights of individual members can also not be suspended except through
disciplinary action. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25, p. 264.

“Standing rules … are rules (1) which are related to the details of the administration
of a society rather than to parliamentary procedure, and (2) which can be adopted
or changed upon the same conditions as any ordinary act of the society. An example
of such a rule might be one setting the hour at which meetings are to begin, or one
relating to the maintenance of a guest register. Standing rules generally are …
adopted … individually if and when the need arises. A standing rule can be adopted
by a majority vote … provided that it does not conflict with or amend any existing
rule or act of the society.”9
RTD currently has no Board-adopted Standing Rules: i.e., rules relating to details of
administration of its meetings rather than to parliamentary procedure, adopted by the
Board through motion and majority vote. Instead, RTD’s Bylaws are detailed in
prescribing certain administrative requirements.
3. Customs
Robert’s Rules describes Customs as follows:
“In some organizations, a particular practice may sometimes come to be followed as
a matter of established custom so that it is treated practically as if it were prescribed
by a rule. If there is no contrary provision in the parliamentary authority or written
rules of the organization, the established custom should be adhered to unless the
assembly, by a majority vote, agrees in a particular instance to do otherwise.
However, if a customary practice is or becomes in conflict with the parliamentary
authority or any written rule, and a Point of Order citing the conflict is raised at any
time, the custom falls to the ground, and the conflicting provision in the
parliamentary authority or written rule must thereafter be complied with. If it is then
desired to follow the former practice, a special rule of order (or, in appropriate
circumstances, a standing rule or a bylaw provision) can be added or amended to
incorporate it.”10
The rest of this memo summarizes RTD’s Board meeting Customs as understood by RTD
staff.

another matter, and in doing so “can briefly give sufficient information to enable the
members to vote intelligibly on his undebatable motion.”8 If anyone objects, a formal
motion to suspend the rules is taken up.

The following are established Customs at RTD Board meetings, as currently identified by
RTD staff. (RTD staff currently knows of no Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.)
There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board formally adopts any Special Rules of Order or
Standing Rules.
1. Voting through RTD’s software system
RTD uses a special software system to display the agenda, the current location in the
agenda, Director requests to speak, and Director votes.
a. Unless the Chair of a meeting determines that the software
has malfunctioned, a Director’s vote may not be changed
after votes flash on the screen except by unanimous consent.
RTD employs an electronic voting system intended to ensure that all Board members
vote at the same time, instead of some members basing their votes upon how others
have voted. Once everyone has registered their votes on their computer terminals, the
final tally flashes up on the screen.
RTD’s custom is that the flashing up of the results on the screen constitutes the official
“announcement,” after which a vote may be changed only through unanimous consent.
This Custom is consistent with a primary purpose of the voting software: to prevent
vote-changing and to make the simultaneous “reveal” of all votes on the screen the
official “announcement.” This Custom is also consistent with Robert’s Rules, which
provide that a member may change her or his vote at any time up to when the result is
“announced.” After that, a change may be done only by unanimous consent.
For this reason, it is very important to make sure Board members understand the effect
of a “yes” or “no” vote, especially in votes on amendments or procedural matters.
b. For Committee meetings, Directors attending by phone
should state their vote before the electronic vote is
conducted. Their vote is then added to the result on the
screen, and the Chair states the final vote and result.
c. If the software system is inoperable, for matters involving a
recommended action or another act of a general or
permanent nature, Directors must vote by a roll call vote as
required by the RTD Bylaws.11

B. Customs at RTD Board Meetings

RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(a), p. 13. The Bylaws authorize “a roll call or electronically recorded
vote by the Executive Director to the Board …” Shows of hands, voice votes, etc. are only
permitted for other action. RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(e), p. 14.

a. The Chair should recognize Director requests to speak, or to
ask questions of staff, in the order of speaker requests set
forth in the software system.
b. The Chair may allow reasonable, brief follow-up questions.
c. Once all Directors on the screen have been given the
opportunity to speak at least once, the Chair should ask each
Director attending by phone whether they wish to speak.
d. After all Directors have spoken, the Chair may speak
concerning a matter.
3. Participation of RTD staff in Board and Committee discussions
a. After a staff Recommended Action item is moved and
seconded, RTD staff are customarily asked by the Chair to
provide an introductory explanation of the item without the
need for questions and answers.
b. Subsequent questions by Directors are handled as Director
requests to speak. RTD Board meetings generally allow direct
questions to staff or other Directors, and responses, without
the need to go through the Chair, but the Chair retains
discretion to handle the conduct of comments and questions.
4. Accessibility, including accessible visual aids and recordings
a. Visual aids and recordings at Board meetings should be made
accessible to participants with visual or hearing impairments.
b. Speakers should generally identify themselves by name and
title before beginning to speak.
5. Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
a. Directors may not participate by phone in executive
sessions.12

2. Requesting the right to speak through RTD’s software system

12

At some recent meetings, Directors were allowed to participate by phone in executive sessions.
Upon further review, it appears that Directors have not historically participated by phone in
executive sessions. Participation by phone is problematic in that other attendees cannot verify
that attendance is limited to permitted participants. As with any other custom, the Board could
vote to allow phone participation on a case by case basis. In such case, staff recommends that

a. Public videotaping equipment is only permitted at such
locations as authorized by RTD Transit Police and must not
disrupt the meeting.
7. Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and
questions
a. Public comments are limited to three minutes in length.
b. Questions from the public will not be answered at the
meeting but will be noted for future response.
c. Public officials are allowed to speak first.
8. Recognition of retiring employees
a. Retiring employees are recognized at the start of RTD Board
Meetings.
b. Retirees who are present are generally honored with a
statement by their AGM and/or manager and are invited to
give a brief statement.
9. What is “old” and “new” business
a. “Old business” is limited to the narrow category of nonrecommended action items that have been postponed to a
time certain at a previous Board or Committee meeting.13
b. “New business” is generally limited to Directors’ personal
announcements.14
10. Adding items to the Agenda by request of at least three Board
members
a. Items may be added directly to a regular Board meeting
Agenda by at least three Board members without having to
any Director participating by phone must first state on the record that the Director is listening by
handset or headset (not speakerphone), and that no other persons are present.
13
RTD’s Bylaws specify that recommended action items that are held over or tabled from a
previous meeting are to be taken up under “Recommended Action,” before new items from
committees. See RTD Bylaws Art. V, Sec. 3(c), p. 11.
14
Items added to the Agenda by three Board members are taken up under “Recommended
Action.” See RTD Bylaws Art. V, Section 3(c), p. 11.

first go through a Standing Committee or Executive
Committee; however, unless the item is of an emergency
nature, to encourage careful debate and consideration the
Chair may refer such an item to a Standing Committee and
the Executive Committee for approval prior to the item being
placed on the Board Meeting Agenda. Approval of such an
item by a Standing Committee converts the item to an “item
from committee.”15
11. Placement of executive sessions when there are multiple
Committee meetings
a. Where two Committee meetings are scheduled for the same
meeting, to avoid the need for members of the public and
non-essential staff to leave prior to completion of all other
business, the Committee Chairs may coordinate to arrange
for any executive session(s) to take place at the conclusion of
the joint meeting.
b. The above procedure is subject to any Director making a
Point of Order to require the executive session to take place
in the standard order of business.
12. Safety Moment
a. Each Board and Committee meeting will begin with a Safety
Moment.
13. Pledge of Allegiance
a. Board Meetings (not Committee Meetings) will begin with the
Pledge of Allegiance.
14. Chair’s participation in matters under debate
a. When taking part in the debate on matters before committee
and Board meetings, the Chair of the Board typically does so
sparingly and at the end of the discussion period.
