RTD Transit Security
• The RTD page on “Transit Security” states, “Officers
inspect fares, discourage disruptive and inappropriate
behavior and act as ambassadors by assisting riders
who may need help navigating the system”
(emphasis mine).
• Thus, we see from the description of the website that the
function of Transit Security is distilled into these three
functions.
• Do we required armed security officers to perform these
three functions?

Packet Pg. 7

1.C.1.a

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

Fares on RTD
• RTD has the highest
adult base fare
(which is $3)
compared to other
cities of similar or
larger size.
• RTD may point out,
though, that the fare
is actually a 3-hour
pass.

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.1.a

Most buses use a pay-as-you-enter
system (though during peak hours,
some regional buses use a pay-asyou-exit system). You can pay via
cash or MyRide Card while you
board or present a valid pass (which
may be a paper pass or electronic/on
an app).

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

How do you pay the RTD fare?

Trains (light rail and commuter rail)
use a proof-of-payment system. You
must have a valid ticket/pass
(typically at a Ticket Vending
Machine) before you board, which
may get inspected by Transit
Security.
Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

Some thoughts on the
MyRide Card
• MyRide Card sounds like a good idea in theory. No
fumbling with change! (There’s a US coin shortage after
all!)
• Only 1% of riders pay with MyRide (Source: Streetsblog
Denver).

• You also get a discount when you pay with it. Adult fare
is $2.80.
• But it’s so hard to get one in the first place! You have to
get it at an RTD Sales Outlet (many of which are not
open weekends) or select Safeway and King Soopers
stores. (You can also order them online.)
• Can’t load a day pass or a monthly pass on it!
• So much potential such as fare capping, which isn’t
used!
Packet Pg. 10

Fare evasion
• Fare evasion is quite low on RTD’s to begin with! According to CPR,
only 1.6% of riders on light rail fare evade and only 0.12% of riders
fare evade on commuter rail.
• “Studies in Washington DC, New York City, Portland, Minneapolis,
Seattle, Los Angeles, and Cleveland have shown that fare
enforcement disproportionately targets black and brown people, and
that people of color face harsher penalties when they are stopped.”
(Source: Transit Center)
• Have there been any independent analyses of fare evasion enforcement on
RTD?

Packet Pg. 11

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

Does fare enforcement actually help?
From Transit Center:
The Seattle-area King County Auditor’s Office released a report on
King County Metro’s fare evasion tactics and stated in part that
“Fare enforcement is an important and highly visible part of
Transit’s RapidRide system, but Transit is not able to determine if it
is effective. The direct costs of the current fare enforcement model
are about $1.7 million per year. This includes over $300,000 in court
costs to process evasion fines, the vast majority of which go
unpaid.”

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

“Eyes on the
street”
• A term coined by Jane Jacobs in The

Death and Life of Great American
Cities

• The general idea is that streets are
safer when there is natural
surveillance, other human presence.
• “Walls, fences, and padlocks are all
less effective at deterring crime than
a simple lit window” (Duany et al.
2000).
• This theory has motivated certain
transit systems to have street
vendors near stations, so as to
increase “eyes on the street.”
• Is this possible in Denver?

BAY AREA RAPID
TRANSIT (BART)
A transit system with a troubled policing history

Packet Pg. 14

BARTPD
• Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) has its own police department (BART Police Department).
• BARTPD made headlines in 2009 when a police officer shot Oscar Grant, an African-American
22-year-old, at Fruitvale station in Oakland.
• The shooting of Grant is still a major point of discussion today, and one of the BART
directors, Debora Allen, received criticism after brushing off concerns about BARTPD. She
wrote off claims that BARTPD murders people (since the shooting of Grant never led to a
murder conviction). (Source)
• Other members of the BART board have called Allen racist.

Packet Pg. 15

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

Attempts at reform efforts
• After the shooting of Oscar Grant, BART made some efforts at
reform. They created a citizen review board and an independent
police auditor.
• However, biases in policing still persisted: “60 percent of BART
police use-of-force incidents involved Black riders, despite the
fact that only 10% of the system’s riders are Black” (Source:
Transit Center).
• A recent headline was a story about a Black rider who was arrested for
eating a sandwich while on a BART platform.

• Reforming transit security must actually bring about meaningful

change. It shouldn’t just be a PR move that ultimately
accomplishes nothing.

Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

Revived attempts at reforming
• BART has made efforts to rely less on armed officers for policing.
• BART shifted $2 million from police to transit ambassadors. (Source:
SF Chronicle)
• Transit ambassadors are unarmed, uniformed employees who can provide help
on stations and trains.

• BART has also previously had an issue with keeping their station
elevators clean and safe. They implemented an elevator attendant
program that has proved to be successful (Source: BART).
• The main takeaway from BART is that there are other methods than
armed police officers to provide eyes and ears to transit spaces.

LOS ANGELES METRO
A transit system facing demands to defund their
transit police

Packet Pg. 18

Metropolitan Division of LAPD
• LA Metro’s security is primarily provided by a division of the LAPD (not a private contractor
as is in the case of RTD).
• Currently, LA Metro is facing demands to defund their transit security.
• Activists and community groups are arguing that instead of investing in security, the money
could be used “on free fares, on better and more frequent service, on homeless outreach
workers” (Source: LA Times).

Packet Pg. 19

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

Metro motion
• A Metro boardmember has announced a motion to shift from a
police-based approach to a community-based approach. Per
Streetsblog LA, these changes include:
• transit ambassador program
• alternatives to armed law enforcement response to nonviolent crimes
and code of conduct violations
• community stewardship of transit spaces, such as supporting street
vending in transit plazas
• Universal Blue Light program – described in a June 2018 Metro report as
an emergency call box system to be installed throughout the transit
system to improve safety and security
• education about and expansion of fare discount programs
• outreach and services for unhoused individuals
Packet Pg. 20

Attachment: Transit Security Elsewhere (revised) (4349 : Transit Security Elsewhere

1.C.1.a

Changes underway
• The motion was passed on June 25, 2020.
• A Transit Public Safety Advisory Committee will be established.
• 15 members, 3 alternates
• Selection will be through an application process: October 12, 2020 November 6, 2020
• Notifying applicants by early December, kick-off meeting January 2021
• Application mentions meetings until at least June 2022
• Application link: http://metro.legistar1.com/metro/attachments/5766a9ce5bd8-4313-9409-48b13f0e3ab1.pdf

• On August 27, LACMTA CEO Phil Washington announced the
that there will be a new task force to study options for a fare-free
system.

TRIMET (PORTLAND)
A transit system with a commitment to making
changes to its policing

Packet Pg. 22

TriMet Security
• Security is provided by a variety of personnel
• Have police officers (from local police departments) as well as contracted security (from G4S)
• There are also ride guides, customer safety officers, and customer service representatives
• Specific duties of these various personnel are listed on the TriMet website:

Reimagining transit security
• TriMet has pledged “to move $1.8 million in funding from Transit Police
and other sources to community-based safety programs” (Source: TriMet
blog).
• TriMet chose not to fill six police positions and instead use that money in
community-based approaches.

• As part of reimagining transit security, TriMet
• has been holding “community-wide listening sessions to gather feedback from
riders, front-line employees and community members on the best approaches to
providing security on our system that is free from bias”

• created “a panel of local and national experts to advise us on national best practices
for transit security, equity and community engagement in safety and security”
(Source: TriMet blog).

• TriMet is also establishing “new non-police response resources, such as
mobile crisis intervention teams for mental and behavioral health issues.”

TriMet’s previous efforts
• TriMet been working on maintaining an equitable system for the past
several years. Previous work they have done includes
• Having independent analyses of the fare citation process to check for any racial
bias
• Decriminalizing fare enforcement by asking state law to be changed
• Discontinuing routine fare checks by police

• Decreasing the fine for fare evasion citations and giving violators the option of
doing community service instead

Richard Foust, Wondu Absu, Josefina Olivas, and Troy Norris. Jaime thanked the group for
being true heroes!

III.

ACPD/APAC Committee Proposal - Zamy Silva
Director Williams has been appointed by the RTD Board Chair to serve on RTD’s ACPD Internal
Steering Committee and she will be reporting to the RTD’s Board on ACPD’s agenda during
the Civil Rights committee. As we move forward, in 2021 as a matter of transparency, and
efficiency, we would like to pilot a new initiative that involves integrating the two existing
ADA committees, ACPD and the ADA Paratransit Committee (APAC). APAC currently meets
every other month and ACPD meets quarterly. We are looking to increase the frequency of
the ACPD meetings to 6 times per year and combine some of the meetings during the year
to include both committees. APAC does not have a steering committee, so we feel that one
steering committee could support both committees. Brent Belisle commented that he would
be in favor of more frequency for ACPD. Please email Jan or Ed if you have feedback or
comments.

IV:

Updates:

Questions/Comments – Vivian Stovall asked about the Auraria light rail and whether the were
going to put any seats back in the rail cars. That will not happen as all rail cars need to be able
to be switched around and any cars may be used as the lead car. This was also part of RTD’s Light
Rails lawsuit Settlement Agreement.
•

Suspended Service Communication - An update was given by Chief of Police, Bob Grado, and
AGM of Communications, Pauletta Tonilas. It was explained that due to the protests and the
vandalism with the riots and protests downtown, bus service into downtown was suspended for
about 7 days. Lots of things were taken into account, but ultimately safety was the main concern
both for our riders and our bus and rail operators. There was a committee of Senior Leaders
formed and they met daily to make these tough decisions, along with the intel and constant
communication with Denver Police. Officers were on hand to take care of DUS and ensure it was
safe. Buses were re-routed to Pepsi Center in some cases. Pauletta stated that we were in
constant communication with the media, our stakeholders, social media posts and website
updates. Ultimately, we made the right decision for the safety of everyone. Jaime thanked
Pauletta and Bob.
Questions/Comments – Both Earl Lee and Greg Martinez commented that they agreed with
RTD’s decision to keep its riders safe. Vivian asked the Chief about the use of DPD’s cameras
and the Chief indicated that we share feed with practically every agency in Denver Metro, plus
our security command monitors 24 hours a day.

•

Ad Hoc Committee Code of Conduct – Barbara McManus provided an update: current RTD
Board Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede formed a committee with community partners, ACLU
members, Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, Denver Housing Authority, Denver Health and
others which was sponsored by Mike Meader and Chief Grado. They worked on the guide and
it was unanimously approved in mid-July by the RTD Board. Education helps to promote rider
safety.
Questions/Comments – Earl Lee asked how these will be communicated with the public and how
will they be enforced. Chief Grado stated that they are available on our website and they have
the communication sent out to stakeholders. Enforcement will be as needed. Jaime stated he is
a little disappointed that the disability community wasn’t asked for their input. Mike Meader did
state that Director Williams was on the committee and shared her efforts for the disability
community.

Bikes on Light Rail Pilot - Paul DesRocher provided an update and indicated that the ‘bikes on
light rail pilot’ will be postponed to early September due to marketing and communications
materials delay. No set date on the launch yet. This pilot uses the space on the light rail cars to
provide room for bicyclists. This pilot does not include the front car on the trains which has the
high block space mainly used for mobility devices/ aids. Pauletta mentioned she wanted to tweak
the signs in order to best communicate this program to our riders.

V.

General Manager/CEO Search – Barbara McManus – Barbara shared the timeline and process
for the Board to select the next General Manager and CEO. An executive search firm started
the recruitment process after Dave Genova retired. Fifty applications were received and were
narrowed down to 18. The Board met during the whole process and soon they narrowed it
down to 6 candidates. Initial interviews were conducted and three candidates moved through
the next phase. The three candidates were required to provide their bio’s and complete a
virtual video presentation which were all issued publicly for the general public to view and
provide input through a survey with a series of questions. Once the evaluation of survey
information completed, the Board will meet again. They have it now narrowed down to 3
candidates and they are all female. On or before the October Board meeting they will have a
decision made and start the contract negotiations. It was advised for the committee to go out
to the website and complete the survey and provide feedback.

•

First 8, everyone is impacted through lifestyle and choices (econ at 60-70%)
• Stay in Place…lost earnings, reduced hours, eliminated jobs
• Lifestyle activates down to 30-40% in sales and employment y/y
• Dynamic impact on service and moderate skilled workers, and low/mod neighborhoods
• Significant increase on public and non-profit safety net; from UI, food, health care, housing …

•

Second 8, economy begins to recovery – but in a new way (econ at 80-90%)
• Core business sectors rebound to 90% plus
• Lifestyle sectors continue to suffer, but rebuilding to 80-85% y/y
• Unemployment settles in 7-9% range, ending the year 6%+
• Labor Force shrinks as individuals make choices and face limited job market (adding to
unemployment
• Retail sector moves beyond evolution to revolution (store consolidation, closures)
• Entrepreneurial activities exploration
• Real estate/development is focused on flex/redeveloped workplaces and attainable housing
• Construction led by public projects (accelerate?) and residential (attainable price)
• Increasing demand for “safety net programs”

Recovery to Growth
• Third 8, a recovered but new economy (econ gets to 100%+)
•

•
•
•
•

Resident behavior and choices have changed; experience over goods consumption
• Retail is increasingly separated from store location – to online home and work-connected
• Dining, entertainment/arts, and then personal/business travel fully rebound and grows
Businesses and workers adapt work choices; increasing choice of work location split
Housing values rise, commercial space needs rise (except for retail), and development in next
place locations…
Increased job opportunities, and rising wage levels (starting late 2022 and 2023)
Continued and changed public/non-profit service demand

• Legacy Issues
•
•
•
•

Retail will not return to 2019 levels evolve toward value and new buying behaviors (online and
workplace connected locations)
Work options will include remote, in-person, hybrid and work pod, reducing both space needs
and travel demand (intra- metro and metro to metro/nation/global)
Experience spending (dining, travel, entertainment/arts/sports) will be a larger part of hhold
spending
Public revenue approaches will continue to weaken, both as base and dependence changes
(Sales tax, fuel tax (HUTF), property tax (commercial vs residential)

2.C.2.a

The COVID-19 impact
The lockdown resulted in leasing activity coming to a virtual standstill in the second
quarter. Tenant decision-making and leasing velocity is expected to remain slow throughout
the summer as businesses decide when to return to the office and then can assess the economic
damage prior to making any long-term space decisions.
Oil & gas slowdown
Oil & gas, and shale drilling in particular, began a small contraction in 2019 as a result of falling
out of favor with Wall Street, but the historic drop in prices in early 2020 will likely result in
continued major space reductions that could add up to 1.5 million RSF to office
inventory over next two to three years.
The coworking impact
Over-saturation, WeWork’s recent issues and the potential fallout of smaller players has been a
growing concern, and with new COVID-19 issues creating health concerns and an
economic pullback, a significant reduction in coworking space is anticipated.
Steady in-migration
Tech companies have been following millennial employees downtown, occupying large blocks
of space and have accounted for the majority of space absorption, albeit primarily in LoDo,
Union Station and periphery areas. A continuation of this theme will be necessary to offset
energy industry pullbacks and anticipated shrinkage in coworking space.
Increasing costs versus lower demand
Rising property taxes, increased construction costs and higher ownership bases over past few
years added to upward pressure on rental rates, but will need to be reconciled with
projected lower demand through the balance of 2020, which will likely put downward
pressure on rental rates.

Denver’s office use

Packet Pg. 655

2.C.2.a

What do
employees
think about
WFH?

What is the
role of the
office?

Employer Perspective: Physical space to bring
people together to showcase a company’s brand
and culture, and to foster collaboration and
innovation
Employee Perspective: A physical space for
social interaction, face-to face collaboration,
mentoring and managing

CONCLUSION: The office is a physical space that
extends culture through social interaction and
improves productivity by enabling collaboration.

©2020 Jones Lang LaSalle IP, Inc. All rights reserved.

What will
be the
lasting
impact on
office?

• Employees feel more productive WFH

• Real estate costs are ~10% of people costs

• Home office set-up and privacy are sub-optimal

• Function of the office evolving to emphasize
collaboration and innovation

• Enjoying ‘not commuting’ the most
• Miss the social interaction of office life
• Will want flexibility to WFH a few days a week

• WFH and technology will become embedded as
a part of flexible corporate life

Attachment: JLL_RTD market update 10-2020 - Final (4352 : Denver CBD Market Update)

Impact of Work From Home (WFH)

• Experiencing “always on” fatigue

• Employers will take this opportunity to
reimagine the future for competitive advantage

CONCLUSION: Flexibility to WFH 2-3 days a week will be
key to employee satisfaction, benefitting both the
employer and employer.

CONCLUSION: Recruitment and retention of talent will
dictate office location, utilization and design; with an
emphasis on flexibility, collaboration and innovation.

Work Trips

Since Stay-at-Home
orders were enacted in
mid-March, work trips
have dramatically
declined, while time
spent at home has
increased in the
Denver Metro Region.
This is likely due to
more people working
from home as well as
people being
furloughed or laid off.

Note: The “Home” category shows change in hours spent at home, while the “Work” category measures the change in number of work trips.

Illustration of a 20% vs. 35% Affordability Goal, Portfolio-wide
RTD holds ~15 properties with real development potential. In the next ten years, some number of them will develop.
RTD’s affordability goal would influence the number of units in those developments that are affordable. Here are three
illustrative scenarios, assuming 300 units per project and showing the difference between a 20% and 35% goal:
If 2 sites are developed:
20% Goal = 120 affordable units

35% Goal = 210 affordable units

Enter Presentation Title
Title Case

If 5 sites are developed:
20% goal = 300 affordable units

35% goal = 525 affordable units

If 10 sites are developed
20% goal = 600 affordable units

35% goal = 1,050 affordable units

A goal is not
enforceable — it helps
focus the agency on a
direction to pursue.

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for October 2020. Given the way meeting dates fall on the calendar, there is not
much new to report.
1. Citizens Advisory Committee – The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) met virtually on Sept. 16.
The Agenda included a presentation on the 2021 Budget and Mid-Term Financial Plan Update and
robust discussion with Bruce Abel and Heather McKillops. The Committee also received an update
on Reimagine RTD from Brian Welsh. The next meeting is September 16.
As noted last month, the CAC is partnering with the Metro Mayors Caucus, local chambers of
commerce and other stakeholders to co-host virtual RTD candidate forums for the three contested
races. Below are the dates and registration links for the three forums:
District A: October 13 from 3-4 PM. Register at http://bit.ly/RTDForumDistA
District G: October 13 from 9-10 AM. Register at http://bit.ly/RTDForumDistG
District H: October 15 from 3-4 PM. Register at https://bit.ly/RTDForumDistH
Finally, an update on the CAC/Board/Senior Leadership Team dinner and roundtable. The Committee
decided to postpone the roundtable to early next year and will meet at its usual time (3-5 PM) on
October 21. The co-chairs have invited RTD Accountability Committee Chair Crystal Murillo and
Vice Chair Elise Jones to attend the meeting.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus – The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) will hold its next full caucus meeting
on Oct. 7. The September Transportation Committee meeting was canceled. Mayors continue to
closely follow the Board’s response to the unprecedented budget shortfall and associated staffing and
service reductions. On Sept. 21, the Caucus delivered a letter to RTD expressing their concerns
regarding using the FISA capital funds on pandemic-driven operational shortfalls rather than the
completion of the unfinished corridors within the FasTracks plan. We will be working closely with
the Communications team to keep mayors and other stakeholders up-to-date as the Board finalizes the
2021 budget.

Re:

October Board Update

BBMK arranged a call with the Governor’s Office and Interim General Manager Paul Ballad,
Board Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Government Relations Chair Lynn Guissinger, Assistant
General Manager Pauletta Tonilas, Director of Special Projects Bruce Abel and CFO Heather
McKillop. The call was well received and provided the administration a high-level briefing on
the most up to date information from the District. Per the suggestion of legislative leadership
BBMK is working to coordinate a similar briefing with candidates for the Colorado General
Assembly.
The Colorado Competitive Council (C3) on behalf of Rep. Caraveo and Rep. Mullica have
requested a briefing on the N-Line on October 8th. The briefing will include the following
legislators: Rep. Rich, Rep. Will, Rep. McCluskie, Rep. Soper, Rep. Baisley and Senator Story
along with representatives from numerous business leaders and members of C3. BBMK is
working with RTD Senior Staff to arrange this briefing and Chair Rivera-Malpiede and Director
Whitmore will be in attendance. BBMK arranged a similar briefing on the B-Line with Rep.
Bird last year as these opportunities are a great way to discuss RTD’s positive economic impact
not only for the region but the entire state.
BBMK continues to monitor the RTD Accountability Committee and subommittee meetings.
The following summaries are from the most recent meetings.

discussing the community-based service delivery and equity in services goals. In this context, the
committee will be looking at how RTD works with local partners to develop transportation
routes and services and how RTD services could improve in relation to social equity. During the
next finance subcommittee members will discuss the larger goals in context of the more detailed
list below. The work of the finance subcommittee will be largely segmented between long term
and COVID-19 related timelines.

3.C.4.a

Social, economic, and environmental equity is a paramount consideration for the RTD
Accountability Committee. The Committee will consider the needs of communities of concern,
including but not limited to minority, low-income, individuals with disabilities, older adult, and
veteran populations. Actions that include spatial and other forms of analysis, community
engagement, and consulting experts will be used at appropriate times to inform the work and
final recommendations of the Committee.

RTD Taskforce Update
The Accountability Committee also received an update from RTD staff Bruce Abel on the
COVID-19 Taskforce recommendations. After hearing about the recommended reductions, the
committee requested the RTD Board start using multiple sources for sales tax predictions and
that the RTD Board support short term policy changes not long-term policy changes. The
committee also discussed sending these recommendations formally to the RTD Board but
decided against this action after some committee members expressed their discomfort in what
they believe would be going beyond the charge of the Accountability Committee. The
Committee will be receiving RTD staff updates monthly and continue to monitor any long-term
decisions the board makes.
The committee will begin meeting only once a month on the second Monday of the month.
Subcommittees will meet twice a month or more as necessary.

Federal Update for October 6 Meeting of Communications and Government
Relations Committee

Short-Term FY 2021 Spending Bill Includes a One-Year FAST Act Extension
Upon return from August Recess after Labor Day, Congress immediately got to work on a
Continuing Resolution (CR) to avert a potential government shutdown and keep the Federal
government operating through December 11. After Speaker Pelosi made last-minute changes to the
original House bill to gain the support of the White House and Senate Republicans, the House
passed the CR by bipartisan vote of 359 to 57.
The Senate intends to vote on the CR by the last day of the fiscal year, September 30. President
Trump has indicated he will sign the legislation, averting a government shutdown.
This CR carries a clean (i.e., virtually no policy changes) one-year extension of FAST Act’s surface
transportation programs at FY 2020 levels and via FY 2020 formulas. The bill also transfers $3.2
billion from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to keep the Mass Transit
Account solvent through the next fiscal year. It is expected that FTA will promptly make an interim
apportionment of 72 days’ worth of formula funding under the obligation authority provided in the
CR. FTA traditionally waits for at least five months of authorizations and obligation authority
before making apportionments, but transit agencies’ funding needs are more urgent than ever, given
COVID-related revenue losses and cost increases.
Prospects Improve for Another COVID Relief Bill
RTD continues its multi-pronged advocacy for additional COVID relief funding for transit.

Attachment: Federal Update 9 28 2020 (4342 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

Federal Update

House Democrats are expected to announce a new, $2.4 trillion COVID relief proposal in the last
days of September. While this total is substantially more than the $1 trillion Senate Republicans
have said they wanted to spend, House Democrats have retreated from their $3 trillion spending in
the HEROES Act passed in May. Details of the bill have not been released, and it is unclear if
another round of transit funding has been included in the bill.

45 Offices in 20 Countries
Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP is part of the international legal practice Squire Patton Boggs, which operates worldwide through a number of separate
legal entities.

Packet Pg. 147

3.C.5.a

RTD and SPB have been making the case for additional COVID funding for transit to the House
and Senate transit authorizing committees, RTD’s Congressional delegation, and in industry-wide
events hosted by APTA and fellow transit agencies. SPB continues to stay in communication with
NYMTA, CTA (Chicago) and other transit agencies to align messaging when appropriate.
Legislation to Secure RTD’s RRIF CRP Fix Remains Viable
We are pursuing all opportunities to secure a RRIF CRP fix. As a result, there are four bills pending
in the House and Senate to require US DOT to return the credit risk premium (CRP) paid on the
RRIF loan for Denver Union Station, including language in the FY 2021 House
Transportation/HUD (THUD) appropriations bill.
RTD’s strongest option to secure the CRP fix before the end of the year is via the THUD
appropriations bill, for several reasons. First, keeping the Federal government funded and
operational will remain Congress’ highest priority, so we expect action on full-year spending bills
(including the THUD bill) by the December 11 expiration of the CR. Secondly, appropriations
legislation is an ideal vehicle for our CRP fix, because we require an appropriation and a general
fund authorization to fund repayment of our CRP, and the House-passed FY 2021 THUD bill
includes both provisions. Finally, the House THUD bill has already passed the full House and our
CRP fix garnered no opposition whatsoever, indicating there should be no hurdles to including our
fix in the final spending bill to be negotiated in December.

Attachment: Federal Update 9 28 2020 (4342 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

Speaker Pelosi appears to be proceeding on dual tracks – signaling to the Trump Administration (via
communications with Secretary Mnuchin) that she would like to see a bipartisan deal come together
while also instructing her Committee chairs to have a Democratic messaging bill prepared for House
floor consideration in the event that a bipartisan deal proves to be unlikely to come together before
the election.
