BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2021 Amended Budget

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2021 to amend and appropriate funds
to increase the 2021 Amended Budget by $194.6 million to $1,860.7 million.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Budget Analyst IV
BACKGROUND
RTD may amend its annual budget at any time during the fiscal year, with Board approval. Budget
amendments are requested primarily when new information or unplanned activities arise, since the
Approved Budget appropriation, that require additional funding, reductions to funding or reallocation of
funds to the appropriate projects, accounts and cost centers. RTD’s budgetary controls require Board
appropriation of funding in order to authorize staff to expend those funds for specified needs.
DISCUSSION
The 2021 Adopted Budget was appropriated by the RTD Board in November 2020 prior to knowing
about additional COVID relief grant funding, call-back of laid-off employees, planned June 2021 and
September 2021 service enhancements and several other budgetary impacts that have arisen during the
intervening period to date. This budget amendment will provide the necessary funding to address those
additional needs while also reallocating certain previously-appropriated budget items for correct
application within the budget control framework.
Fiscal Policy Adherence
The RTD Board approved the 2021 Fiscal Policy in October 2020. The following are key components of
the 2021 Fiscal Policy and explanations regarding the extent to which this 2021 Amended Budget
adheres to those requirements:
•

RTD will contract with a third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts: The 2021 Amended
Budget includes the March 2021 sales and use tax forecast from the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business

•

RTD will develop service changes that are matched to funding capacity using the system-wide
and route-specific productivity measures that have been approved by the Board: The 2021
Amended Budget includes funding for the enhancements to the June 2021 and September 2021
runboards in addition to funding necessary to maintain front-line staffing levels based on direction
from the RTD Board to allow use of up to $30 million per runboard from the $203.4 million
Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) grant.

Packet Pg. 30

11.A

•

Priority will be given to replacement of existing, backlog and deferred assets before consideration
of new assets: The 2021 Amended Budget provides funding for a limited number of maintenance
and replacement needs that are critical to maintaining safety and compliance.

•

RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance equivalent to 3 months of operating expenses,
excluding depreciation, for unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs as well as to
mitigate service disruptions during economic downturns: The 2021 Amended Budget fund
balance is equivalent to 4.1 months of operating reserves primarily due to one-time COVID relief
grant funding

•

RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (revenues available for debt service after
subtracting operating expenses) of 1.2 times: The 2021 Amended Budget results in a 1.9 times
revenue coverage ratio primarily due to one-time COVID relief grant funding.

The RTD Board also included the following guidance that is specific to the COVID Pandemic in the 2021
Fiscal Policy that applies to the restoration of funding that may occur and the 2021 Amended Budget
appropriation requests meets these criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

Restore reserves to three months if possible
Do not utilize existing FISA balances
Limit or eliminate use of future FISA rubber tire service contributions
Restore deferred projects related to compliance or safety
Restore service as ridership allows

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Budget and 2021 Amended Budget appropriations requested.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Internal Audit Function Charter

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the Internal Audit Function Charter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Internal Audit Function is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function that is
guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operations of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD). The Internal Audit Function assists RTD in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic
and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of RTD's governance, risk
management, and internal control.
The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), the international professional association for the field of internal
audit, states that the internal audit charter is a critical document that records the agreed-upon purpose,
authority, and responsibility of an organization’s internal audit activity. The charter allows for the board
of directors of an agency, as well as the agency’s chief audit executive (CAE) and its executive
leadership, to have mutual understanding of:
•
•
•
•

Internal audit objectives and responsibilities
The expectations for internal audit activity
The CAE’s functional and administrative reporting lines
The level of authority, including access to records, physical property, and personnel, required for
the internal audit function to perform engagements and fulfill its agreed upon objectives and
responsibilities

DISCUSSION
The Internal Audit Function adheres to a charter promulgated pursuant to the IIA’s International
Professional Practices Framework (IPPF), also referred to as the “Red Book” of the internal auditing
profession. The Internal Audit Function’s charter was last approved by the Board in 2017.
The Office of the State Auditor (OSA), through its 2020-21 performance audit of the Regional
Transportation District’s (RTD) internal audit function, and the Peer Review Panel assembled by the

Packet Pg. 63

12.B

American Public Transportation Association (APTA), through the panel’s formal report in May 2021,
recommended that the internal audit function revise its charter and submit it for approval by the RTD
Board of Directors on an annual basis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of the Internal Audit Function Charter.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
September 2021 Service Change Proposal - Service
Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report to comply with federal
laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Zamy Silva, Civil Rights Senior Manager
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
Carl Green Jr., Transit Equity Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
With public health restrictions on building capacity and public gatherings lifting there has been an
increase in requests for a return to pre-pandemic service levels. Though current ridership levels indicate
modest increases, the anticipated return to school and workplace planned for the September 2021
timeframe support the need for increased commuter service. The September service change proposal,
contain a mix of service enhancements and adjustments that address commuter/school service patterns
and contract compliance, leveraging the resources previously dedicated to supporting social distancing.
The proposed service changes further modify the initial COVID-19 service plan implemented April 19,
2020 and modified in both January and June of 2021. The route services contained in the September
service change proposal are a mix of formerly suspended commuter routes with educational institutions
as major ridership generators. The projected school attendance and the number of requests received for
additional commuter service align this proposal with RTD’s service guidelines.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the guidance for
the proposed September 2021 service changes also incorporate the Board’s adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle 3:
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to

Packet Pg. 71

12.C

access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
DISCUSSION
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September service
change proposal includes 18 major service changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought before
the RTD Board of Directors for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is shown
in Attachment A.
RTD’s Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Major Service Change Results: RTD is proposing changes to 28 bus route/patterns and 3 rail lines of
RTD’s forthcoming September 2021 runboard. Of these 31 changes, 18 services meet established
thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below have proposed modifications or
reinstatements to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service. Routes in bold met a threshold
for major service changes.

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
Methodology:

Packet Pg. 72

12.C

Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route level, route block
group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity
or income.
Summary of Findings:
• None of the proposed changes involve reductions in service; all service changes in this runboard
were additions of service through modifications or reinstatements of suspended service.
•

Of the 31 total proposed service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 2 had
both disparate impact and potential disproportionate burden findings.

•

At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes were compared only for those with major
service changes. Of the 18 routes with major service changes, all but 1 route (P) serve aboveaverage minority or low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity
populations received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to
non-equity populations. Minority areas had a nearly +2% benefit above non-minority areas and
low-income areas received over +6% compared to higher income areas.

Conclusions:
Although some of the major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact or a
disproportionate burden at the route-level, Title VI concerns are minimal at the network level when
comparing the service changes between the June 2021 and September 2021 runboards. In aggregate, a
review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes. Overall, the
system-wide service increases have positively impacted equity groups moderately more compared to
non-equity groups. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found
related to the proposed major service increases in the September service change proposal.
RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership decline, personnel impacts, resource
allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty serves as justification for maintaining the
September service changes proposal.
RTD will continue to assess the equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will
propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis does not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of the service changes between the June 2021 and September
2021 runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes,
disparate impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group
levels to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD is proposing changes to 28 bus route/patterns and 3 rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming September 2021
runboard. Of these 31 changes, 18 services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The
routes listed below have proposed modifications or reinstatements to service that were greater than 25%
of baseline service. Routes in bold met a threshold for major service changes.
Modified Services (25 services)
(Additional trips, expanded spans of service)

Reinstated Services (6 services)

Findings
None of the proposed changes involve reductions in service; all service changes in this runboard were
additions of service through modifications or reinstatements of suspended service. Service was modified
with additional trips, decreased headways, or longer spans of service, and some routes were finally
reinstated since their elimination during extreme service reductions in the face of last year’s challenging
pandemic.
Major service change increases were entirely invested on bus services, and within bus service classes,
these additional hours were distributed among Central Business District (CBD) Local (22.4%), Urban Local
(34%), Suburban Local (26.5%), and Regional (16.7%) bus routes.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service changes and as
a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity populations received a greater
increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-equity populations. Minority
areas had a nearly +2% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income areas received over +6%
compared to higher income areas.
However, potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified: of the 18 routes
that had major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 2 routes had both
disparate impact and disproportionate burden findings.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between
the June 2021 and September 2021 runboards. Routes with major service changes include 19 major
increases with 6 of those major service changes being reinstatements of formerly suspended routes.
These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the route level and in aggregate at the
block group level to identify potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD.
These changes include the addition of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of the residents of the District and maintain a highperformance, sustainable transit system.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color
or national origin; also disparate effects on low-income and minority populations; and
•Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and
frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes
within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the District’s responsibility to
identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of
service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to
establish performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The
District uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of
the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider leastcost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.
--Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios -- Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These
policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:

1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that
includes, but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating
segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the
degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a lowincome population 10 percent more than higher income populations; this level of impact is
considered a disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who
are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources & Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level.
Other data related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of
these datasets into a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with
changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to District equity
communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2021 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major
service changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional
difference in changes made to equity populations within a route’s quarter-mile service area. These
proportional differences were compared against District population proportions of equity populations and
route proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on
150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines),
based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of 3. Minority status was based
on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the
collection of block groups within the District boundaries.

Route service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around
bus stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of
census block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the
underlying block group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter
mile; if 50% of a block group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population
would count as being included (ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route modification to provide the percent
difference from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major
service change for further review.

phone at 303-299-2004, and by fax 303-299-2227. The main comments were related to adding back
service.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
Proposed service changes for the September 2021 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in
service were categorized by equity grouping (minority or non-minority, low-income or higher income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within
the prior network using 2018 ACS 5-year demographic data.

A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route service area and compared those against
the equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route
service area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route had a
potential finding of disparate impact (for minority populations) or disproportionate burden (for lowincome populations) and was flagged for a finding of potential impact.
MAJOR SERVICE CHANGE TEST
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (annual trips) of 25% or more

Changes by Transit Mode
Additional hours of service were primarily driven into rebuilding bus services that had previously been
curtailed or suspended. Bus service was increased by nearly 454 daily revenue service hours. The E, W,
and N rail lines had modest increases in service (additional trips on E Line, additional trip on W Line, and
schedule modifications N Lines). Additional daily revenue service hours are proposed for modified or
reinstated services, with 380 of those hours at or above major service change thresholds.

Changes by Route Service Class
All service changes were reviewed by service class, categories generally describing the geographic location
or service area (and unique performance thresholds) of each route. Service changes included all changes
to daily hours in addition to only hours associated with major service changes. Service classes include 4
categories for bus services: Central Business District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, and
Regional, a rail category, and 3 special services (MallRide, MetroRide, and the Englewood Trolley).
Generally, additional hours of revenue service were evenly distributed among CBD, Urban, and
Suburban Locals and Regional services, with slightly more allocated to Urban and Suburban Local
services.

Major Service Change Review
A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in
aggregate equity groupings of routes prior to individual review of routes, route block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are
categorized as the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Changes
Eighteen bus routes had major service changes and included 12 bus routes with service increases of 25%
or greater and 6 reintroduced bus routes.

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
There were no major service reductions.

Major Service Change Increases/Restructuring
Eighteen routes were found to have major service change increases. These included 6 reinstatements (0L,
3L, 116X, CV, EV, and P) and 12 modifications to spans of service or additional trips (10, 19, 42, 48, 120W,
204, 206S, 225, JUMP, SKIP, BOLT, and LD3). Other routes had modifications that did not meet the
threshold for major service changes (20, 43, 45, 46, 65, 105, 121, 130, 153, DASH, E Line, W Line, and N
Line)

Route-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in
the analysis is to look at each route individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (minority
populations) and/or Disproportionate Burdens (low-income populations). Both service reductions and
service increases are analyzed (for this analysis there were no reductions). For service increases, the

12.C.a

analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and lowincome populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects
of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

DISPARATE IMPACT AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN ANALYSIS
For each route with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s impacted equity
and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity populations; if the
difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is required for potential
adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were
reviewed for potential disparate impact (DI) or disproportionate burden (DB) findings. In summary, the
review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•
•
•

14 routes met the threshold for a potential disparate impact
2 routes met the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden
2 routes met thresholds for both impacts

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Network Analysis
A network analysis is not typical in RTD’s equity analyses but was used to understand the large number of
service changes occurring across the network. A network level analysis has potential to provide further
understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
While RTD has not established a formal policy for a network level analysis, the major service change
threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as precedent to determine
potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring further review. Once
average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of District block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or
greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes
experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major
service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels
(block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, service was increased by over 450 daily revenue hours.
Of the over 350,000 people available to be served by stops within the service area of routes with
major service changes, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of population
than District averages, indicating targeted services to equity groups.

•

At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. Of the 18 routes with major service changes, all but 1 route (P) serve aboveaverage minority or low-income populations.

In aggregate, a review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes.
An analysis of all District block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline
equity thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude
of impacts of the June 2021 to September 2021 service change. Block groups with low-income and
minority populations at or above the District average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block
groups whereas higher income and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block
groups.
NETWORK ANALYSIS PROCESS
Determine block groups at/above District averages for low-income population (16.8%) and minority
population (35.4%)
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2018
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the
total minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the
District-wide low-income and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified
as above average. While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population
of the service area (3.019 million) the low-income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a
slightly smaller population figure. This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census
Bureau can determine3. The thresholds summarized in Error! Reference source not found.4 yielded 751
(39% of all) block groups above the District average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block
groups above the District average for minority population.

Proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Table 5 summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter mile
of stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District. This
comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall.
Equity groups stand to benefit more than non-equity groups, with minority population benefitting almost
2% more than non-minority population and low-income population receiving 6% more than higher income
population.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the
District, as well as highlight routes with major service changes (orange). Low-income populations and
minority populations appear to overlap in similar areas outside of central Denver, including most of
Aurora, Commerce City, and Brighton, and areas east of Boulder, and areas southeast of Longmont. Lowincome populations appear to have greater spread, with additional areas in the mountain communities
and areas west of Downtown Denver.
Proposed major service changes indicated in these figures show the reinstatement of regional express
services in outer areas previously impacted by pandemic service cuts, such as CV, EV, and P. Reinstatement
of these services expands regional access across the District service area. Several routes also cover large
expanses of equity areas, such as Routes 3L, 19, and 42.

The June 2021 to September 2021 service changes are symbolized in Figure 3. Depiction of route and
segment changes by severity of change, June 2021 to September 2021. This map provides a generalized
view of where service is changing at the route pattern level. The June 2021 bus network is colorized
according to the percentage change in the annual trips. Rail service (E, W, and N lines) had minimal
changes and is excluded from shading. The September 2021 network includes several routes being
modified (light green or teal) or reinstated or having large increases in service (dark blue).
Many reinstated routes are occuring in the periphery of the network and are regional in focus. These were
some of the first and largest cuts to the bus network last year. This includes some of the mountain services
from Evergreen and Conifer to Denver, for example as well as LD3 from Longmont and Route P from
Parker. Some limited services were also reinstated such as 0L, 3L, and 116X among others. Most of the
urban core routes, particularly those in the East Sector serving significant levels of equity populations, saw
some increases in service, represented in green.

Summary of Findings
The network changes that are proposed between June 2021 and September 2021 include modifications
to service that include additional trips and longer spans of service as well as reinstatements of routes
previously suspended during the pandemic. These include limited stop overlays supplemental corridor
local service as well as regional express routes from suburban and mountainous areas of the District. The
major service change increases were entirely invested on bus services, and within bus service classes,
these additional hours were distributed among CBD Local (22.4%), Urban Local (34%), Suburban Local
(26.5%), and Regional (16.7%) bus routes. None of the proposed changes involve reductions in service;
all service changes in this runboard were additions of service through modifications or reinstatements
of suspended service.
Route-level Findings:
•

Of the 31 total proposed service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 2 had
both disparate impact and potential disproportionate burden findings.

Error! Reference source not found.6 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings
of potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis,
and provides the individual route service change.

RTD Service Equity Analysis: June to September 2021 Service Changes

Attachment: RTD Title VI Service Equity Analysis Report Sept 2021 - 07_7_2021 (4538 : September 2021 Service Change Proposal - Service

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an
alternative that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will
either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid,
impacts/disproportionate burdens, or;

minimize,

or

mitigate

potential

disparate

b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there
are no alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate
burden on low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed September 2021 service changes4 include adding improvements to the
routes 42, 45, 49, and 121 (all serving high concentrations of minority populations) signifies RTD’s
response to ensure an equitable distribution of service improvements and to minimize impacts.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial
ridership decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty
serves as justification for maintaining the September service changes proposal.
Systemwide-level Findings:
•

Of the over 350,000 people available to be served by stops within the service area of routes with
major service changes, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of population
than District averages, indicating targeted services to equity groups.

•

Of the 18 routes with major service changes, all but 1 route (P) serve above-average minority or
low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service changes
and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income populations received a
greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-equity
populations. Minority areas had a nearly +2% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income
areas received over +6% compared to higher income areas.

Therefore, no system-level disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed
major service increases in the September service change proposal.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Incorporation of Land Acknowledgement During Monthly
Board Meetings

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to incorporate a Land Acknowledgement during its monthly Board Meetings.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Chair Rivera-Malpiede
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
According to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian, “land acknowledgment is a
traditional custom that dates back centuries in many Native nations and communities. Today, land
acknowledgments are used by Native Peoples and non-Natives to recognize Indigenous Peoples who are
the original stewards of the lands on which we now live.”
DISCUSSION
By adopting this recommended action, the Board acknowledges its intent to include a Land
Acknowledgement at the beginning of each monthly Board Meeting, immediately following the Pledge of
Allegiance in the order of business, in order to:
•

Honor the many indigenous peoples who have made the land now known as “Colorado”
home, from the time long before its establishment as a state to the present day;

•

Protect the history and heritage of Colorado’s indigenous peoples by recognizing them as
the traditional stewards of the land now served by the Regional Transportation District;

•

Begin to right the wrongs of the past by acknowledging the exclusions and erasures that
have been visited upon indigenous peoples.

The text of the land acknowledgement is as follows, though the Board may choose to revise this text
from time to time as appropriate:
The RTD Board of Directors acknowledges that the land on which our buses and trains
operate is the traditional territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho and other contemporary
tribal nations that are historically tied to these lands. We honor our Indigenous elders who
have traveled, inhabited, and stewarded these mountains, hills, and plains throughout
generations. May this acknowledgment demonstrate a commitment to working to dismantle
the ongoing legacies of inequity of the native and all historically oppressed peoples, and
recognize their current and future contributions in the district as we move forward.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no fiscal impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
September 2021 Proposed Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
July 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors approve the September 2021 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargain Agreement
shared between RTD and ATU 1001, the September Service Change Proposal facilitates both an
opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments and the opportunity for
Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for RTD’s transit network. A vital
part of the development of the service plan, involves stakeholder and customer input processes. The
stakeholder listening phase is in addition to the public listening phase, which will begin this month as
part of the September service change process. Both the stakeholder feedback and customer input will
help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
With public health restrictions on building capacity and public gatherings lifting there has been an
increase in requests for a return to normal service levels. Though current ridership levels indicate modest
increases, the return to school and work planned for the September 2021 timeframe support the need
for increased commuter service. The proposals herein, contain a mix of service enhancements and
adjustments that address commuter/school service patterns and contract compliance, leveraging the
resources previously dedicated to supporting social distancing.
It is intended that the proposed service changes to the current COVID 19 service plan be adopted as
further modification to the initial COVID service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in both
January and June of 2021. The route services contained in this proposal are a mix of formerly
suspended commuter routes and routes with educational institutions as major ridership generators. The
projected school attendance and the number of requests received for additional commuter services align
this proposal with RTD’s service guidelines.

Packet Pg. 120

12.E

The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected customers;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the overarching
guidance for the proposed September 2021 service changes come from the Board adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 3 public meetings conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams on June 28, July 1 and July 7
with 138 public participants. These meetings have been recorded and are available for review.
Comments from this public comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachment B of this
report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following highlighted proposals have been added or
significantly modified:
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: additional peak period service
Route 42 – Montbello/Green Valley via Albrook: restore Route 42 weekday peak period

SERVICE CHANGE COMMENTS SUMMARY
The summary highlights the increased frustration of the unsatisfactory service provided by
RTD.

To present information on complaints received about RTD proposed September Service changes.
Use the feedback to improve services.

KEY POINTS:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

People do not find their complaints are acknowledged. They want service to return to
the pre-COVID schedule. Reinstate discontinued and suspended routes.
Service Planning and Scheduling received more than 280 complaints about the
proposed September Change.
The complainants reflect on their general dissatisfaction with RTD, particularly with
the COVID service changes.
Many complaints include Service Planning Concerns such as part of their routes being
full or discontinued, and bus stop placement of suspended/discontinued routes.
People find the current Saturday and Sunday schedule unacceptable, especially for
workers who work late nights. Several have called to have later departure times in the
schedules. As well as requests for earlier departures.
Complaints are often related to many issues or concerns about the COVID Service Plan.
The lack of frequency of the buses and trains. Complainants cite issues about
returning to work while RTD services remain scarce.
Parents are concerned about the lack of available public transit options for students.
Fares are a component of many complaints. Complainants associate COVID service plan
as a factor to increase expenses. They cite the lack of frequency should equal a
decrease in fares. If they must wait hours to board due limited services, then the fares
are absurd.
People will soon be returning to work and school. Passengers are skeptical of the
efficiency of using RTD given current challenges.

MOST FREQUENT REQUESTS:
•
•
•
•
•

Over 60 requests were received for the return of the GS.
The complainants expressed the need for pre-covid schedules to return.
Many complaints include Service Planning Concerns such as reinstating routes (C and
F), scheduling later times for events, and adding cars for events. The consensus is
providing more reliable service.
Regular requests were received to reinstate the 205 to the Heatherwood loop and the
NB. Route 21 to continue to Federal Station. Also, for the return of the 116x, Free
Metro Ride, the FF branches (FF2 – FF7), the Y, P, 122x, Dash, 225, 10, CV, and EV.
Riders would like to see better connection amongst buses and trains.

Austin Ward
220 Summit Blvd. Unit 220
Broomfield, CO 80021

Board of Directors
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear board members and CEO Debra Johnson,
My name is Austin Ward I am a current RTD operator out of the Boulder Division, a
graduate from CU Boulder, a former candidate to represent District I, and I am a transit
advocate. With COVID-19 restrictions being lifted, vaccination rates increasing in the Denver
region, and people beginning to return to a version of life as we knew prior to this public health
crisis, I am delighted to see that some routes are getting increased service levels. While the
return to some level of pre-pandemic frequency on the SKIP, JUMP, BOLT, and 225 is critical,
service and planning is ignoring other routes that are just as critical to the Northwest region.
The University of Colorado Boulder will be returning to mostly in person classes this fall
(at least 95% of learning will occur in person) and will see and the largest incoming freshman
class in their history, between 6,500 and 8,000 students. I have heard that the number will be
closer to 8,000. The return of students will also mean a return of hundreds of employees
ranging from professors and dining hall staff to janitors and facility maintenance personnel.
Many of these employees do not use the services that are scheduled for frequency increases
because they live in areas that are not served by the SKIP, BOLT, DASH, 225, 204, and 206.
Many commute along the US 36 corridor from Broomfield, Westminster, and Denver,
Lakewood/Golden, or the eastern and northern parts of Longmont not serviced by the BOLT.
FF1 service needs to be restored to pre-pandemic levels, while FF2, FF4, GS, and J routes need
to be reinstated.
RTD’s mission is to “meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by
providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the
District”. Part of our responsibility is to anticipate where service will be needed. While I strongly
support the use of data collected from our automatic passenger count systems (APC) to assist in
determining service levels, those numbers serve no purpose for routes that are not even
running or when a large increase in ridership will occur within a short period of time. Common
sense and an analysis of historical ridership data (pre-pandemic) would be far more helpful in
this situation. I have driven each of these routes and can attest that the ridership consists
predominantly of students and/or faculty. Should RTD not return these routes, we will have
failed to meet our mission and it will be another mark in the books showing how inept we are
at conducting our own affairs. Public trust is not something we are in excess supply of, and we
should be doing everything our power to regain that trust.

Representative Marjorie Sloan

Dear Representative Sloan,
I am writing this letter in support of reinstating the GS line reconnecting Golden to Boulder. This line was
suspended following the changes in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and is needed as we move
into a strong recovery. Its return would help Golden commuters move more easily throughout the Front Range
region, provide a connection between the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado Boulder,
and connect residents north of Golden to the metro area through existing RTD routes. The return of the GS line
could help the recovery in the foothills.
The City of Golden has prioritized developing multi-modal transportation options in our Strategic Action Plan
and Transportation Master Plan. The GS line helps the City achieve its goals of having a variety of transit
options. Currently without the GS line, there is no transit connection between Golden and Boulder. The GS line
helps reduce commuter traffic along a busy highway and provides options for individuals without vehicles. The
GS line would increase alternative means of mobility and reduce the environmental impact to the region.
Thank you for your consideration of returning the GS Line into service. Expanded transit routes will help
commuters and community members by providing convenient multi-modal options for the Golden community
and broader region. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely,

Mayor Laura Weinberg

Marjorie Sloan
District M Representative
Regional Transportation District Board of Directors
Subject: RTD GS Regional Route – Letter of Support for Service Return
Dear Ms. Marjorie Sloan:
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) enthusiastically supports including the RTD GS Regional
Route in the September service additions. NREL has aggressive goals to reduce vehicle commuting trips and
convenient transit service is one of the ways that we can achieve these goals.
Prior to the COVID-19 service reductions, NREL had three RTD routes that stopped adjacent to our campus:
RTD Route 20, 125 and the GS Route. In the Spring 2020, Routes 20 and 125 were discontinued and in
January 2021, the GS Route was discontinued. The closest bus stop is currently the RTD Route 16 stop at
S Golden Road and Moss Street/Research Road (which is more than a quarter mile from our campus
entrance and more than half-mile from our closest building). NREL has continued to invest in the EcoPass for
all employees, we currently have 2,190 active EcoPass card holders.
As we are planning for employees to return to campus, we are receiving numerous calls/emails about when
the GS Route will return to service and how we (NREL) are going to accommodate those staff in the interim.
We have more than 200 employees at NREL that work in Boulder County; many of these staff relied on the
GS Route for one or more days a week and are now left with fewer options to commute to campus. PreCOVID-19, on average 30-35 NREL staff per day used the GS Route to commute to/from NREL. The
discontinuation of the GS Route is a gap in the transit network that served the NREL/Boulder/Golden
community.
We strongly urge you to reconsider adding the RTD GS Route to the September service additions as this
route is critical to our employee commuting needs.
Sincerely,

RE: Question on Important RTD Route for NCAR|UCAR Commuters

Hi Chelsea.
Good to hear from you.
Thank you for your email in regard to the proposed September 2021 service changes and Route GS.
We did receive several requests for Route GS to return, at our first public meeting for the proposed September 2021
service changes, on Monday night as well.
At this time, we are not considering to reinstate Route GS; however, we are monitoring closely as to what the ridership
demand might be, as we move into fall and people returning back into the ‘in-classroom’ and ‘in-office’ environment.
Also, we have to very carefully weigh as to where to apply our resources, as our operator shortage is significant and we
need to address routes which are experiencing overloads and standing room only, before we can reinstate routes which
pre-COVID19 already had low ridership and which also, if reinstated take up a lot of our resources in the AM and PM
peaks (such as Route GS trippers would do). We need to balance equitably, effectively and efficiently for the entire
District as we move forward, with the resources we have at hand.
So, again, we will continue to monitor and should things change to where we are in a position that would allow us to
reinstate route GS, we will see what we can do, to do so, as well as evaluate the level of reinstatement at that time.
Your request has been officially noted and will be added to the public comments for September 2021 proposed service
changes. Feel free to join for the public hearings still to take place and voice your feedback/comments/input in this
regard at either, or both of them, also.
Have a wonderful afternoon.
Cheers.

Subject: Question on Important RTD Route for NCAR|UCAR Commuters
Hello Nataly,
I hope you are doing well!
As I imagine is the case with many employers, UCAR|NCAR is beginning to bring people back to the office.
Because we have historically offered a robust suite of transportation services and benefits to our employees,
many staff are reliant on transit services in order to commute to their office. We were excited to see that RTD is
starting to increase service frequency and bring a few routes back, but as you know, some areas are still
without service. Specifically, the cancellation of the GS route between Golden and Boulder is of major concern
for a group of our employees who relied on that route to get to work.
I'm planning to attend one of the upcoming public meetings that RTD is hosting on service changes, although I
noticed the GS is not on the list of routes being considered for changes. Do you have a sense if the GS has a
chance of coming back in the near future or at all?
Thank you for your help and any information on the GS you can provide!

Dear RTD Board of Directors,
As you plan for September 2021 service changes, the Colorado School of Mines (Mines) asks
you to consider the transit needs of our students, faculty, and staff. Emerging from COVID-19
restrictions and beginning our fall semester (August 23, 2021), Mines anticipates a full return to
in-person classes and on-campus living. The demand for transit travel between Golden and
Boulder (through Arvada and to NREL) will definitely increase. However, the GS bus, which
serves the daily needs of the Mines community, has been suspended since implementation of the
RTD COVID-19 Service Plan in April 2020.
Moreover, transportation is our State’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Mines, a topranked research university, is committed to the responsible stewardship of the earth and its
resources and has developed a campus culture of sustainability. Accordingly, it is invested in the
use of alternative transportation. As an example, Mines has long been a participant in the RTD
EcoPass program. Reinstatement of GS bus route can make a major contribution to the reduction
of single-occupancy-vehicle trips along Highway 93.
We thank you for dedication to public transportation in our region and appreciate RTC’s postCOVID-19 budgetary constraints. At this time, we respectfully ask you to work with us in
addressing service on the GS route.

GM OVERSIGHT & PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Third Amendment to GM and CEO Employment

Committee Meeting Date:
July 8, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Third Amendment to the CEO and GM Employment Agreement to
establish the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation program for General Manager
and CEO Debra A. Johnson as set forth in the proposed amendment.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (“GMOC”) Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement, dated September 29, 2020, which
provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by which the Board will
annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. The deadline for the Board to adopt the performance
evaluation program was originally March 9, 2021. Consistent with the anticipated RTD Strategic Plan
development timeline, in February 23, 2021, the Board adopted a First Amendment to the Agreement,
extending the deadline to no later than June 30, 2021. On June 29, 2021 the Board adopted a Second
Amendment further extending the deadline to July 30, 2021.
The Board and Ms. Debra A. Johnson are nearing the conclusion of the strategic planning process to
establish RTD’s mission, vision, values, and success outcomes, including key performance indicators.

establish the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation program for Ms. Johnson. Ms.
Johnson will have the opportunity to submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board prior to the issuance of any
final performance appraisal. For the performance period of November 9, 2020 through November 8,
2021, the Board will evaluate Ms. Johnson based upon the criteria set forth in the Job Description
approved by the Board in connection with the 2020 CEO and GM recruitment. For performance periods

Success Outcomes and 50% subjective Organizational Values as adopted by the Board pursuant to the

restaurants and breweries, taking in iconic scenery, or experiencing culture and history, the surrounding region
is an excellent place to live and work.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is the region’s public transit agency created in 1969 by the Colorado

customer friendly community-oriented transportation network. As a nationally recognized leader, RTD
provides public transit services, including rail, bus, access, and shuttle services across 2,400 square miles to 40
municipalities (3.1 million people) within eight counties including Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Jefferson and
parts of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas and Weld Counties. RTD is governed by a 15-member, publicly elected
Board of Directors each serving a four-year term.
The region prides itself on innovation, inclusion, multi-culturalism, diversity, and environmental sustainability
and RTD’s vision is further enhance the region’s quality of life as well as to augment the pattern of urban
development throughout the region. RTD continues to develop dynamic programs to benefit both business
and the community it serves, making RTD an important cornerstone for the Denver community.
In 2004, RTD embarked upon the nation’s largest public transportation capital expansion program. RTD has
been steadily working on its commitment to deliver on this voter-approved program, known as FasTracks.
While, circumstances have changed and budgets have been stressed with economic events occurring such as
the 2008 recession, in 2019, RTD embarked upon a two-year “Reimagine RTD” effort. Even with this effort
underway, uncertainties still exist with COVID-19 and other unforeseen factors arising.
As such, RTD is continuously listening to its communities’ needs and striving to find necessary funding and cost
savings that will support creative transit solutions in order to uphold its commitment to provide safe, timely,
affordable, convenient, accessible and equitable transit solutions to the entire region. By reimaging transit and
creating a new vision, RTD is committed to supporting the economic engine that the greater Denver region has

programs.
