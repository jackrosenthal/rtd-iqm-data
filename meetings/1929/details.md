## V. Public Participation

Chair Sisk opened the meeting up for public participation and asked each speaker to please state his or her name and address.  They have a time limit of 3 minutes.  He recognized first a couple of elected officials as speakers.

- Joseph Cirelli, Mayor Pro-tem for Superior, indicated he was representing the US 36 Mayors and Coalition Solutions.   He stated they support the NAMS Consensus Statement.  They have been working to improve transportation in the northwest corridor.  The NAMS Study was a valuable stakeholder process. The Resolution details RTD support and how we will work together in the short, medium and long term.  They are looking forward to resolution of some of the bi-directional issues.  They are grateful for RTD’s support of the US Tiger planning Grant.  The recommended arterial BRT does not use FasTracks funds.  While they are disappointed that Northwest Rail may not occur until 2042, they are ready to move forward on the recommendations from the NAMS Study.

- Jennine Jeffries, Englewood, spoke as a single mother of four.   She is an advocate for affordable transit.  Right now, she has to spend $4.00 each way for transit or $32 per day for her family. We really need a sliding scale or income based pricing.  She is currently fighting for self-sufficiency and affordable public transportation is needed.

- Zoë Williams, Englewood, representing 9-to-5, shared a story from someone living in Director Tobiassen’s district. She shared that Mekala is a 27-year-old undocumented worker making minimum wages who works two jobs in the janitorial service.  She cannot afford the bus and often has to walk at least 5 miles to get to work. Because she is an undocumented worker, she cannot access any of the services for discounted fares and is sometimes taken advantage of by her employees.  Making public transportation affordable needs to be a priority of the fare task force.

- Gina McAfee, Ex member of the US 36 Commuting Solutions Board of Directors, expressed the need for mobility for the US 36 corridor.  She appreciates that RTD is working with this corridor on multimodal solutions.  She wants to offer her support for the approval of the NAMS Consensus Statement.  She commended the staff for their patience and diligence.  This Resolution represents a concerted effort of the US 36 corridor to include BRT as a natural model. We need to move forward with the advancement of BRT while committing to Northwest Rail as a long-term commitment.  They understand the challenges of increased rail construction costs.

- Scott Kerr, Denver, indicated he is Director of the Homeless Services for Bayaud Enterprises.  He shared they spend about $45K of their annual budget to purchase bus passes.  Many of the users of their service needs bus passes and what they can offer is a very small component of the actual need.  They may give out a couple of passes when the person may need passes for the full month in order to seek jobs and other opportunities where they can become self-sufficient.  As indicated a number of people needing affordable tickets are undocumented workers.  We need to find a way to provide affordable public transportation for low-income people who ride public transportation.

- Thomas Trujillo, challenges the City and County to make transportation more affordable. We need more income based pricing for bus fare.  This needs to be a win-win situation.  RTD needs riders to fill the seats and low-income needs affordable fares so they can get to work and where they need to go.

- Charles Sharrock, Aurora, stated that he has two ideas.  The first has to do with trash around bus stops and finding a way to engage the people to keep the bus stop areas clean.  The second idea is one that he has been working on for a number of years.  He provided a sketch of this idea for their consideration.

- Mayor Pat Quinn, Broomfield, CFO of Loja group, and member of the US 36 Commuting Solutions, complimented General Manager Washington and his staff on the progress that is being made.  He indicated we need to continue to focus on the long-term viability of the City.  He supports the recommendations from the NAMS Study but indicated BRT is a short-term solution.  As such we need to make sure it kicks ass-Wi-Fi, real time information, etc. and a fulfillment of these promises.  We need viable and affordable solutions.

- Laura Cerros, Adams County, spoke to the Board with an interpreter.  She shared she is a mom living in Adams County who uses public transportation to take her kids to school and other activities.  This is quite expensive.  Where they have to cross there is lots of traffic and sometimes it is difficult to cross the street; there is no shelter or protection from the elements; there are no signs leading to the bus stop.  She is here advocating for affordable transportation such as family bus passes.

Chair Sisk shared that in addition to the public speakers, the Board had received letters in support of NAMS from Will Toor and Bruce Benson, University of Colorado.
