B. CAC Update
Staff informed Committee Vice-Chair Lasater there would be no CAC update.

C. Updates

• US 36 Express Lanes Construction Update
Nadine Lee, Project Manager of Engineering, gave the Board an update on
the US 36 Express Lanes Construction as presented on page 4 of the
FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations/Planning and Development
Committee Packet for June 3, 2014. The goal of the update was to provide
background, project scope, and next steps. Since the last update to the
Board, activity has centered around:
 Reconstruction of US 36
 Additional express lane in each direction
 12-ft wide shoulders for “Bus-on-Shoulder” operation
 Bridge reconstruction
 Improvements to 12 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) platforms, including new
passenger canopies
 Installation of Active Traffic Management system
 New commuter bikeway
At this time Committee Vice-Chair Lasater ceded the chairing of the meeting
to Committee Chair Larry Hoy. Chair Hoy thanked Director Lasater for
starting the meeting and Nadine Lee for her presentation.
Director Menten asked if there would be any conflict on the commuter bike
path between commuter riders and casual riders. Nadine Lee replied that the
commuter bike path is designed for a maximum speed of 20 miles per hour.
She said she was not sure what the posted mileage would be but noted
posted mileage is usually 5 miles per hour below the design speed. She also

added the path would have 2 foot shoulders – one on each side. Director
Menten then asked if any municipalities use slow traffic signage on their
bike paths to regulate traffic and avoid accidents. Nadine Lee told Director
Menten that she would do the research and provide her with the
information.

Chair Sisk expressed his thanks to Nadine Lee along with Bill Van Meter,
Assistant General Manager of Planning, and Chris Quinn, Project Manager
for Planning. He also thanked every staff member who has worked on this
multimodal project. He shared his excitement on the project coming
together on schedule and under budget. He congratulated the staff on their
communication with the stakeholders which has allowed for better
communication between the Directors and the stakeholders.
Director Hoy thanked staff on their efforts and expressed the Directors
appreciation, especially those Directors whose Districts are along US 36
Corridor. He noted the importance of the McCaslin Diverging Diamond
Interchange (DDI) as it is one of the first of its kind in the nation. He
inquired about its opening date. Nadine Lee replied that she will
communicate with CDOT and inform the Directors of the timeline. She
explained that the opening of US 36 will involve public education campaigns
as many of the features will be new to the public. Director Hoy noted that
the stakeholders are also interested in the timeline.

D. Other Matters
Chair Hoy confirmed there was no CAC update. He invited the Directors to attend
the next CAC Quarterly Meeting on June 18 from 6:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M. at the

B. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, indicated that June is a month of
meetings, conferences and travel. He noted that the Metro Mayors Caucus
will have a full Caucus meeting on June 4, 2014. He shared that he will be
attending the Downtown Denver Partnership’s Urban Exploration Trip, which
Director James will be attending as well. He pointed out that this trip, as
well as Accelerate Colorado, presents great opportunities for informal
discussions with Colorado’s elected officials. Roger Sherman informed the
Board that he would report back if there were any specific comments by
elected officials in their District.
Roger Sherman stated that he will be attending the Colorado Municipal
League Annual Conference from June 17-20, 2014. He believes this will be
a good opportunity to interact with RTD’s mayors and council members
throughout the District.
Roger Sherman noted that the quarterly meeting for the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee will be in Boulder on June 18, 2014. He invited the
Directors to attend. Roger Sherman said that there would be a presentation
on the Northwest Area Mobility Study consensus as well as a discussion
about RTD’s upcoming DRCOG reports.
Roger Sherman shared that the Metro Area Commissioners Meeting will be
the last Friday of the month. He commented that at this time the agenda
has not been released but he plans to be there if there are any transit related
issues.
Director Daly congratulated Roger Sherman on the great telephone town
halls that he was conducting with each Director.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna

Jenifer Brandeberry shared that the LAC recently met and approved two
items for research time that pertain to transportation funding: (1) HTPE and
US36 and (2) CDOT and FASTER Funds. She reiterated that this is just for
research time; the Committee may vote to proceed with a full audit at the
July Committee Meeting. Jenifer Brandeberry stated that TLRC has released
its committee meeting dates but no agendas yet. She said that she has
been working with a committee staffer to coordinate the report/presentation
that RTD does each year.
Jenifer Brandeberry noted that Friday, June 6, 2014, is the last day the
Governor has to sign or veto a bill. She commented that it remains to be
seen if Senate Bill 14-197 regarding to P3s in Colorado will be signed,
vetoed or become law without signature.
Jenifer Brandeberry said that there have been some interesting
conversations between the oil and gas industry, municipal governments, the
agricultural industry, and homebuilders in regards to calling a special session
to deal with some of the pending ballot measures. She shared that this is
something the Governor would really like to happen but she sees it being
difficult due to timing.
Jenifer Brandeberry informed the Board that during the legislative session her
firm and Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, offered briefings on the
Northwest Area Mobility Study to the legislators on the corridor. She said
there were four briefings conducted; her office is continuing to work to
schedule additional meetings.
Committee Chair Folska thanked Jenifer Brandeberry for her report and for
Brandeberry~McKenna’s pro-active approach to educating our legislators.
Director Bagley wondered if the special session would include something
related to construction defect legislation. Jenifer Brandeberry stated that it
would be called directly to address oil and gas and setback issues.
Director Bagley asked if Jenifer Brandeberry expected something to happen
in the next session in reference to construction defect legislation as it relates

Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 3, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna, stated that the legislature is
out of session so Brandeberry~McKenna is gearing up for the interim
committee meetings. She said they follow the Legislative Audit Committee
(LAC) and the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) on
behalf of RTD.

6.B

Director Menten wondered if it was possible to find out what the focus is of
the two items approved for research time by the LAC. She also wondered
what the timeframe might be to determining if there would be a full audit.
Jenifer Brandeberry explained that typically the initial research time has a
very broad net. She believes the focus for HTPE research is to actually
review the contact while the focus of the FASTER research is to see how
the dollars have been allocated. Jenifer Brandeberry said that she
anticipates a vote on a full audit for both items during the July committee
meeting.
Director Lubow asked if RTD took a position on the P3 legislation. Jenifer
Brandeberry stated that was something that her team monitored on behalf of
RTD.
Committee Chair Folska asked if Jenifer Brandeberry thought the red light
camera bill might come back in the next session. She noted that Bruce
Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, provided her with some
evidence of how well these cameras assist us in reducing our accident rates.
She thought it might be valuable to share with the sponsors. Jenifer
Brandeberry stated that this has been a perennial issue for some years; she
anticipates someone bringing it back.

• Federal Update - Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Patton Boggs, shared with the Board that his firm had gone
through a merger effective January 1, 2014; they are now known as Squire
Patton Boggs.
Mike Dino stated that the Senate is in session while the house is not. He
noted that there is a lot of activity in Washington as they are trying to get a
lot done before the summer recess. He shared that the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee met recently to try to undo what the house is
trying to do. The Senate Subcommittee approved a little over $11 billion for
transit which is about $500 million more than the House Subcommittee. He
stated that both of these amounts are much less than what the President
asked for in his budget which was about $17.5 billion.
Mike Dino commented that RTD pays particular attention to the
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant
program. He said that the senate has allocated $550 million, the house

Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 3, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to Transit Oriented Development, Transit Oriented Communities or in any
other matter. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that the sponsors of the last bill
have indicated that they plan to continue to work on the issue along with a
large group of organizations that have signed onto the coalition.

Mike Dino reminded the Board that the current reauthorization expires on
September 30th while the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) runs out of money in
late July/early August. He stated that both sides are trying to figure out
how to pay for the HTF. The House version is to eliminate Saturday delivery
of the mail but this is very controversial because it is a one-time patch and
many people do not want to see that happen. In the Senate the
Chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Barbara
Boxer, is suggesting that the HTF be replenished with a wholesale tax on
gas and diesel, eliminating the federal sales tax at the pump,
Mike Dino noted that the President’s reauthorization has allocated $550
million for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) but has not changed the current BRT
definition. He stated that as the Board is aware, the goal was to get the old
definition back, which would allow RTD more flexibility. He said that this is
something his team will continue to pursue.
Mike Dino shared that General Manager Washington and Marla Lien, General
Counsel, put a report together for Congress and the FTA that discusses
what RTD learned from going through the New Starts process using the P3
platform. This follows-up on General Manager Washington’s testimony to
the P3 Special Panel. He stated that it is very positive that RTD is seen as a
resource and expert in this area.
Committee Chair Folska asked Mike Dino how he thinks RTD would fare
qualifying for BRT funding given that the definition may not fall back to the
SAFETEA-LU definition. Mike Dino explained that it would present a
challenge for RTD; there is a small amount of money, subject to a stricter
interpretation of BRT, that would be distributed to entities meeting that
definition.

C. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

$100 million while the President asked for $1.25 billion. Mike Dino shared
with the Board that the Senate number usually prevails in the appropriations
process. He pointed out that the House Committee also began restricting
TIGER. They do not allow any transit projects; they are completely focused
on highway, bridge, port and freight rail. He said that when the full House
Appropriations Committee did their mark-up of the bill they did fully fund the
New Starts program at $1.7 billion, which is good news for RTD.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of NAMS Recommendation
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which accepts
the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area
Mobility Study stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study
Area. Implementation of these priorities will be subject to future Board
consideration and approval.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to move this item
to the full Board meeting at the June 24, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Chris Quinn, Project Manager for Planning, reminded the
Directors about the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)
presentation during the May 13, 2014 Planning and
Development Committee Meeting. At that time staff
presented the findings of the study, which was summarized
in the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS
stakeholders.
Director Hoy wanted to confirm that the document staff was
referring to was the letter sent from the US 36
Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC) to General Manager
Phil Washington on April 9, 2014. Chris Quinn replied that
document became the basis for the consensus statement. The
process was reviewed by two groups:

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 3, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Tom Tobiassen
Jeff Walker

 A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which included
staff members from the northwest area local
jurisdictions, Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT), Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG), the University of Colorado Boulder, 36
Commuting Solutions and the North Area
Transportation Alliance (NATA)
 A Policy Advisory Committee (PAC), consisting of the
elected officials from the local jurisdictions as well as
representatives from CDOT, the 36 Commuting
Solutions Board of Directors, NATA and the RTD Board
members representing Districts within the study area.
At the final PAC meeting, stakeholders arrived at a consensus
on how to move forward with transit improvements in the
northwest area. A Consensus Statement was developed to
document the principles and priorities desired by the
stakeholders.
Director Hoy confirmed that the motion calls for future RTD
Board consideration and approval indicating ongoing
discussion on the subject.
Director Lubow emphasized that her constituents would like to
see the Northwest Rail line built. She also stressed the
stakeholders asked for an annual RTD report on the status of
the rail.
Director Bagley said he appreciated the opportunity to meet
with Director James and 36 Commuting Solutions
representatives. He said he understands and is supportive of
the stakeholders Final Consensus Statement. He pointed the
Directors to priority #4:
“The stakeholders recognize the present funding
challenges and accompanying near-term inability to
secure an agreement with the BNSF. However, as
noted above, completion of Northwest Rail, while a
longer term goal, remains a priority. On an annual
basis, RTD will explore and update Northwest Rail
implementation strategies and report to stakeholders
and the public.”
He recalled from the Southwest Corridor experience that
construction should not start until there can be construction
for revenue service. He will be voting no at this meeting and

Packet Pg. 19

will probably introduce an amendment during the Board
Meeting.
Director Anderson said she supports the Consensus statement
as recognition of community work as well as Board
acceptance of the stakeholders’ priorities.

C. Updates

• RTP/Senate Bill 208 Update
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, presented the
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)/Senate Bill 208 update as found starting
on page 19 of the FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations/Planning and
Development Committee Meetings Packet for June 3, 2014. He was joined
by Susan Wood, Project Manager for Planning, and Genevieve Hutchison,
Transportation Planner.
The update explained two (2) concurrent processes: the Baseline Report on
FasTracks and the Base System Fixed Guideway.
The Baseline Report on FasTracks update gave a status on the FasTracks
projects, an updated schedule of completion, a revised schedule for the
Southeast Rail extension, bus service levels and operations. In order to
comply with Senate Bill 208, FasTracks reports have been prepared for
DRCOG review and approval since 2004.
The Base System Fixed Guideway update gave a background on the Senate
Bill 208 which requires RTD to submit a report on fixed guideway projects
(currently 119 BRT and US 287) to the DRCOG for approval.
Both processes need to be submitted to DRCOG by August 1, 2014. Staff
is updating the Board during the June meeting, will present items for review
and action during the July FasTracks and Planning and Development

Packet Pg. 20

committee meetings in order to have Board action on July 15. DRCOG will
review/approve the reviews during the fall. These reports will be included in
the DRCOG 2040 RTP for approval in December, 2014

Director Lubow asked if staff knew RTD’s funding responsibility for the
Southeast Rail extension as expressed in the Full Funding Grant Agreement.
Bill Van Meter answered that staff is waiting for local stakeholders’ final
commitments to RTD and will communicate to the Board the final amounts
prior to the July action deadline.
Director Anderson asked if staff anticipated any modifications to the Risk
Allocation Matrix (RAM) and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA)
during the SB208 process, specifically as it pertains to rubber tire/bus
services. Bill Van Meter answered that staff does not anticipate any
changes to the RAM/FISA assumptions adopted by the Board in late 2012.
Director Folska pointed out Bill Van Meters’ comments relating service to the
inflation rate and asked what would happen if the inflation is negative. Bill
Van Meter answered that in the case of negative inflation, FasTracks will
fund the same amount of service hours. He said that staff understood the
Board’s intent for FasTracks to continue funding base system service at the
level determined at that time. If a negative inflation were to occur, the
dollar amount would decrease but the service purchased by FasTracks would
remain the same. General Manager Phil Washington pointed out that if such
scenario were to happen staff would come to the Board.
General Manager Phil Washington clarified that in order for RTD to accept
federal funding, our plans must be included in DRCOG’s plans. RTD is
leveraging the Full Funding Grant Agreement of $92 million and the
substantial contributions from local governments for the Southeast Rail
extension. This update lays the groundwork to move the Southeast Rail
extension up in the schedule.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Phil Washington updated the Board on the following events:
 This week a delegation from Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, visited the region
and met with Tom Clark, Denver Chamber Executive Vice President, Maria
Garcia Berry, Chief Executive Officer at CRL Associates, and Lakewood

B. Recommended Actions

• Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 40-60’ Articulated Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in an amount not to
exceed $26,720,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 40
additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the June 24, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that this action is the exercise of an option to continue
the replacement of RTD’s articulated buses. Dean Shaklee,
General Superintendent of Maintenance, noted that the
request is for 40 buses to replace our 9100 Series Articulated
Buses; these buses are 14 years old and average 406K miles
per bus. He said these buses have reached their useful life so
staff would like to replace them.
Bruce Abel explained that a Request for Proposal (RFP) was
done last year with the contract being awarded to New Flyer.
RTD has already procured the first 40 buses for replacement

Director Deadwyler participated via phone. Directors Folska, James, Lubow, Menten,
Tobiassen and Walker were absent.

6.D

Chair Sisk asked if staff had gone through a replacement
process to determine if the buses are at the end of their useful
life or if it is just based on the Federal Transit Administration’s
(FTA) guidelines. He questions why there are 40 buses that
need to be replaced at the same time. Bruce Abel commented
that the FTA guidelines are actually 12 years for useful life.
He said that his team works with the Finance Department and
State of Good Repair to determine when the buses will be
replaced. Bruce Abel explained that fleets are not replaced all
at one time; this is the second year of a phased replacement.
He said that as the buses are delivered staff will prioritize
which buses are replaced first based on condition. Bruce Abel
reiterated that staff has extended the useful life of the buses
an additional two years so RTD has really gotten the best bang
for our buck.
Director Lasater inquired if staff would use the retired buses as
donor buses for hard to get parts. Dean Shaklee said that
some parts will be taken for spares but not every bus will be
stripped down. He shared that the buses are sold at auction,
noting that a running bus brings RTD a lot more money than a
non-running bus.
Committee Chair Solano wondered if these buses would go
into primarily RTD managed areas or to our contractors as
well. Bruce Abel said that since these are articulated buses
they will go into RTD service as our contractors do not operate
articulated buses.

amount not to exceed $46,428,700 for the purchase of 110 additional 40’
transit buses and associated spare components.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 24, 2014
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Dean Shaklee stated that this action is to replace the existing
2000 Series Orion transit buses that have exceeded their
useful life. The buses are 14 years old and have an average of
620K miles. He shared that the bus company went out of
business several years ago, making getting parts to maintain
the buses very difficult. Bruce Abel noted that this represents
the second year of a multi-year phased replacement.

C. Updates

• Fare Task Force Update
Bruce Abel introduced Lacy Bell, Project Manager of Planning. He said they
would be reviewing a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the June 10, 2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet.
Bruce Abel stated that the objective of the Fare Task Force is to simplify
RTD’s fare policy in an equitable and cost-effective manner. He reiterated
that this study looks forward to 2016 when RTD will be opening our new
Commuter Rail lines.
Bruce Abel noted that at the last Board meeting, Zoë Williams of 9to5
thanked RTD for allowing her group to participate in the Fare Task Force.
Bruce Abel explained that staff has identified an opportunity for the public to
work with the Task Force at the problem identification phase to help
determine what they perceive to be current problems with the fare structure.

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 10, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly seconded the motion.

6.D

Bruce Abel highlighted that in looking at the peer agency fare comparison,
RTD is close to the average fare for our comparison agencies. RTD’s fares
versus the average are as follows:
 Local Cash Fares: $2.25 (RTD) versus $2.22 (Average)
 Express Cash Fares: $4.00 (RTD) versus $3.31 (Average)
 Regional Cash Fares: $5.00 (RTD) versus $4.50 (Average)
 Local Monthly Pass: $79.00 (RTD) versus $81.62 (Average)
Bruce Abel also highlighted that while RTD’s service area is 2,326 square
miles, the average service area of our peer agencies is 827 square miles.
Lacy Bell shared that a Request for Proposal for a consulting firm had been
issued; proposals are due June 13, 2014. She said that after a firm was
selected the next steps would be:
 Update peer review
 Identify alternative fare structures
 Develop evaluation methodology
 Evaluate alternatives
 Provide recommendations
 Assist with public outreach
 Final report
Bruce Abel indicated that the timeline is broken into three phases: (1)
Structure to be completed Q1 of 2015; (2) Fare levels to be completed
Q2/Q3 of 2015; and (3) Programs to be completed Q2/Q3 of 2015.
General Manager Washington noted three important items based on the
presentation:
1) This is a very complex issue. Staff is being very deliberate and do
not want to rush the process. He shared that other agencies have
rushed to increase or decrease fares with disastrous effects on the
bottom line or budget.
2) Staff is making no assumptions as to the results of the Fare Task
Force. He pointed out that many people are expressing that the

Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 10, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel informed the Board that there are three terms that will be very
important to understand as they are all interrelated but very different at the
same time. They are (1) fare structure (i.e. local, express, regional); (2) fare
level (actual cost for each fare structure); and (3) fare program (i.e. EcoPass,
NeighborhoodPass, Nonprofit Agency Reduced Fare Program). He said that
the Fare Task Force will begin looking at structure, then levels, then
programs so there is a logical progression. Bruce Abel explained that our
current fare structure is a hybrid; RTD has distance based and class based
fares.

6.D

Director Daly said that when he rides the West line there seems to be a lot
of confusion for the passengers about fare zones. He hopes this is
something that might be able to be simplified. Director Daly recognized that
they match to local, express and regional but that correlation is not evident
to the riders. Bruce Abel stated that the opening of the West line was one
of those water shed moments that helped illustrates some of the paradoxes
in our system. He noted that previously a rider could ride a local bus from
Golden to Downtown but now they must go through three zones on the light
rail.
Director Daly suggested the Fare Task Force looks into having a family ticket
plan. He said it can be very expensive if a family of five or six is trying to
use the West line.
Director Hoy pointed out that based on General Manager Washington’s
comments, the time for the next fare increase would be now as it has not
happened since 2011. He believes that waiting to look at the fare in 2016
is just too long. He stated that he is an advocate for the Board evaluating
the fare every year. Bruce Abel explained that the Fare Policy makes an
assumption that fares are reviewed every third year to reconcile changes in
the Consumer Price Index. He said that with the Fare Task Force in place it
really does not make sense to look at changes until 2016. General Manager
Washington reiterated that staff did not feel they could propose a fare
change without having the Fare Task Force results. He also noted that in
the past, the public has hated having yearly nickel and dime increases. He
said this feeling may have changed, which is why the public outreach will be
so important.

1

After further discovery it was determined that this fare analysis is not part of the Board Bylaws
but is outlined in the 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement that was approved by the Board at the October
29, 2013 Board Meeting.

Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 10, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

process is taking too long as people need help now but that assumes
that fares will be decreased.
3) When the Strategic Budget Plan was first presented to the Board in
May, there was a lot of discussion about staff making the assumption
of a fare increase. He noted that in the Board Bylaws1 it discusses
the District doing an analysis every three years to determine if a fare
increase is warranted. The next analysis would be in January of
2015 but staff has decided to wait until 2016. General Manager
Washington reiterated the importance of having the result of the Fare
Task Force before making a decision.

6.D

Director Rivera-Malpiede wondered how long RTD had been offering the
Non-profit Agency Reduced Fare program and how many agencies
participate. She also wondered how many transit agencies offered similar
programs to help low-income riders. Bruce Abel said that RTD has been
offering this program for at least 15-20 years with approximately 250 nonprofit agencies participating. He stated that he was unsure of how many
other agencies offered a similar reduced fare program. General Manager
Washington told the Board that perhaps this can be added to the scope of
work for what the consultant will be looking at with our peer agencies.
Director Lasater shared that from personal experience people take small,
incremental cost increases better than a large increase every three years.
When he was on the E-470 board the plan was to increase the tolls 25 cents
every three years but people were very angry. Director Lasater explained
that when they moved to the license plate toll they began increasing it 5 to
10 cents every year. He stated that there were very little complaints when
done this way. Director Lasater wonders if there has been a mindset
adjustment since RTD’s experiences. General Manager Washington agreed
that this is something to look at again but noted public preference is not the
only consideration; the internal cost is huge to change the fare every year.
Director Lasater asked if RTD had done an analysis of ridership when fare
was increased. He noted that E-470 saw a drop in usage but an increase in
revenue; eventually the ridership came back. Bruce Abel stated that what
really drives RTD’s ridership is the price of gas. There have been instances
when the fare has increased and ridership has as well.
Chair Sisk thanked staff in advance for reaching out for public input at an
earlier stage. He believes this is a critical component of the Fare Task Force.
He encouraged staff to not limit the people with whom they are consulting;
he feels this is an opportunity to really talk to our community, not just our
non-profit agencies.
Director Rivera-Malpiede echoed Chair Sisk’s comments; she wholeheartedly
agrees that this is a pivotal point for this agency to outreach to all 15
Districts. She believes this is an opportunity not just for the income
challenged, but for all our communities.
Committee Chair Solano thinks that it is great that we are doing a fare
study. He feels this needs to be done as thoroughly as possible in a timely
manner. Committee Chair Solano requested that staff come back to the

Director Hoy commented that in previous discussions staff indicated that
this was just a fare simplification; however, it really seems like it is now tied
into a change of fares as well.

Board every few months for a review and analysis. He also suggested
having a similar process as the Northwest Area Mobility Study for public
communication.

Bruce Abel stated that staff will be briefing the Board about the Task Force’s
status/progress on a quarterly basis.

• Smart Card Project Status Update
Judy McMurphy, Project Manager, informed the Board that over the past
few weeks her team has been doing trending analysis on the reports that are
coming from the Smart Card machines. She said this has provided a lot of
interesting information about how our riders are using their cards. She
shared that through this analysis they have identified that there are changes
that need to be made in our equipment for people that tap frequently versus
those that do not. Judy McMurphy said that her team was working closely
with Xerox to increase the number of cards that a validator can hold.
Judy McMurphy said that she was also looking internally at some of RTD’s
business processes and system elements that are in place to support the
program to improve its performance.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if Smart Cards will be able to address users
that might have more than one Pass (i.e. NeighborhoodPass and EcoPass).
Judy McMurphy said absolutely; her team is monitoring reports for each
company to make sure an employee does not show up more than once. She
said that fare inspectors and bus drivers are also being trained to look at the
card to make sure the picture matches the user.
Chair Sisk stated that he hopes we get Smart Cards sooner rather than later.
He shared that recently he was on a SkyRide that was 20 minutes late
leaving. Chair Sisk noted that it can be frustrating watching someone put
thirteen one-dollar bills into the machines. He believes that Smart Cards
would really assist in expediting the boarding process.
Bruce Abel stressed that staff is working diligently to have Smart Cards
stood-up in a very professional and customer focused manner.

Director Anderson commented that there are a lot of issues on the table with
this, fare structure being one. She agrees with Chair Sisk and Director
Rivera-Malpiede that the Task Force needs broad participation. She said it is
not just the income challenged community that has issues with fare but the
whole spectrum of people. Director Anderson noted that when the Board
raised fares before it was not easy; no matter what RTD does it will not be
easy but it needs to be done thoroughly with a great deal of thought.

Jannette Scarpino presented the 2015-2020 SBP Update starting on page
106 of the Operations & Customer Service/Finance Administration &
Audit/Civil Rights Committee Meetings Packet for June 10, 2014. She

Director Anderson asked how RTD’s retail marijuana tax revenue would be
affected if the statewide marijuana tax revenue exceeds the estimated
annual revenue and lawmakers take action under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights
(TABOR). Terry Howerter answered that action should not affect RTD’s
retail marijuana tax revenue.
Director Bagley noted the reference by Jannette Scarpino of the SBP
opportunity related to Board strategic goals and General Manager tactical
plans. He reminded the Directors of an email he sent inviting them to the
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee on
June 24th at 3:00 p.m. At this time the General Manager’s tactical Plan will
be reviewed. The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee will provide their recommendations on July 1, 2014 to be voted
on by the Board on July 15th.
Chair Sisk asked Jannette Scarpino to send the Directors the listing of
deferred projects in the SBP’s first draft. His concern is the possible domino
effect the deferred projects may have on other projects scheduled for 20152016.

• First Quarter 2014 Performance Measures
Jannette Scarpino referred the Directors to the First Quarter 2014
Performance Measures report starting on page 115 of the Operations &
Customer Service/Finance Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee
Meetings Packet for June 10, 2014.
She noted the overall improvement in on-time performance and customer
complaints. She highlighted the results of goals 3.1 and 4.2.
Director Deadwyler said she would communicate her comments to staff
offline.

After further discovery it was determined that this fare analysis is not part of the Board Bylaws
but is outlined in the 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement that was approved by the Board at the October
29, 2013 Board Meeting.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 10, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

During the presentation, General Manager Phil Washington noted slide 6 of
the presentation which addresses a 10% fare rate increase to be considered
by the Board every 3 years per the Board Bylaws. He said that staff will
recommend a change of language to read “fare rate analysis” instead of
“10% fare rate increase”. The change must be done by the Directors as it is
Board’s Bylaws1.

• Sales & Use Tax Compliance Review Program Update
Terry Howerter introduced Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting,
who presented the Sales & Use Tax Compliance Review Program Update.

• April 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod presented the April 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
starting on page 129 of the Operations & Customer Service/Finance
Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee Meetings Packet for June 10,
2014.
He noted that there may be some changes in the May, 2014 Monthly
Financial Status Report as the W Rail Line was first included in the May,
2013 report.
Doug MacLeod reminded the Board that under the Net Position section on
page 133 there is now a line item for the FasTracks Internal Savings
Account (FISA). He informed the Board that going forward there will also be
a report included on the FISA that outlines each item identified in the Risk
Allocation Matrix (RAM). He stated that the figure under each year
represents the estimated amount RTD will collect for that RAM item. He
explained that those figures will change over time as staff receives new
information or circumstances change. Doug MacLeod noted that the last
column shows what has actually been collected to-date.
Director Hoy asked staff how they will keep track of the Sales and Use Tax
Exemption Parity (parity). Doug MacLeod said it is included in the last line of
the FISA Report found on page 138. He noted that staff is working on
strategies to keep track of those items. Terry Howerter added that RTD is
working with the State as the State tracks some of the parity but not at the
level RTD needs. Director Hoy encouraged staff to do their best in tracking
the parity
Director Bagley noted that the ridership for the base system is flat. The new
ridership is attributed to the W Rail Line.

D. Other Matters
Chair Sisk asked Terry Howerter for an update on his trip to New York for the
Certificates of Participation (COPs). Terry Howerter said that the COPs price was
set on June 5, 2014. The COPs will close on July 1st. He noted that at first not all

Doug MacLeod said the first compliance review started in March. The first
results will be available in July. He noted the length of the process as it
involves discovery, identification, permissions, and approvals from RTD and
Colorado Department of Revenue for a compliance review. He noted that
future updates will include any revenue generated for the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA).

the COPs were signed up for. JP Morgan, the underwriter, will take the remaining
COPs on their book and issue them to interested parties as they become available.
This allowed for all the COPs to be issued and for the North Metro Rail Line to
move forward. Brendan Morgan, Investment Manager, will send a full report to the
Directors.

• Updated RTD DBE Program Plan June 2014
Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, introduced Zamy Silva, Small
Business Office Manager, to update the Directors on the RTD Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise (DBE) Program Plan.
Zamy Silva reminded the Directors that RTD’s DBE Program Plan, which
describes how the District manages and oversees the DBE program, must be
approved by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). This plan must be
revised and updated as necessary.
The Civil Rights Department recently updated the DBE Program Plan in the
following areas:
 Submitting a “Fostering Small Business Plan” to FTA in accordance
with new regulations established in 2011.
 Incorporating a 19% goal of DBE participation and methodology to
the plan. This 19% was submitted by RTD in August, 2013 and
recently approved by FTA.
 Incorporating policies and procedures to monitor sub-recipient DBE
compliance.

• Civil Rights Outreach

At the DUS DBE Advisory Council meeting, the Civil Rights Department
recognized top performing contractors, DBEs, and SBEs who worked on
DUS. Helga Grunerud, Hispanic Contractors of Colorado’s Executive
Director, assisted in presenting the awards. Rick Clarke, Assistant Manager
of Capital Programs, General Manager Phil Washington, and Committee
Chair Rivera-Malpiede attended the event.
Kenn Hardin acknowledged the WIN participants’ participation during the
Public Private Partnership (P3) Roundtable on May 9, 2014. He pointed out
how the WIN program positively affects the life of the participants.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Stakeholders Event was held at
Dick’s Sporting Goods Park on May 28, 2014. Over 300 people
participated. RTD explained to the attendants the many projects and
opportunities available to small businesses contractors. He thanked
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede for helping secure the venue.
The Civil Rights Department employs students from Arrupe Jesuit High
School as part of the school’s Corporate Work Study Program. This year
marked the first graduate to work with RTD. The District was recognized as
a corporate sponsor of the program during the graduation ceremony.
The Civil Rights Department recently hosted a networking session/pre-bid
event for the Central Park Park-n-Ride. DBEs were given clear directions on
the project. The DBE goal for this project is 27%.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede thanked Kenn Hardin and the Civil Rights
staff for their work. She informed the Directors of her participation on most
of the mentioned events. She finds it overwhelming how many lives this
department influences on behalf of RTD. She considers the Civil Rights
Department the backbone of our community.

Kenn Hardin informed the Directors that his department hosted the Regional
Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (Las Vegas). Chair Sisk,
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede, General Manager Phil Washington, and
City and County of Denver Economic Development Director Chris Martínez
welcomed the delegation. They were interested in how RTD operates the
DBE, Small Business Enterprise (SBE), and Workforce Initiative Now (WIN)
programs. During a tour of Denver Union Station (DUS), the conversation
focused on RTD’s best practices.

6.F

D. Other Matters
General Manager Washington reminded the Directors of the email sent announcing
RTD as the recipient of the APTA Innovation Award. The WIN program, along with
the MAX program and the Leadership Academy, was one of the biggest

Other Matters
General Manager Washington provided an update on several items:
 RTD had good participation in the APTA Rail conference and rodeo. There were
five Board members attending the conference. RTD received a number of requests
to present on Eagle and DUS. Marla Lien, General Counsel, participated in a preconference international Financial Practicum and shared a lot of good information
about our experience with DUS and Eagle as well. RTD earned 3 rd place overall at
the APTA International Rail Rodeo. RTD was also a recipient of a Certificate of
Merit for light rail safety and security. Director Hoy, General Manager Washington,
AGM-Rail Jenkins and AGM-Safety Genova accepted this award.
 General Manager Washington noted that a notification had been sent out
announced that the grand opening of DUS was being delayed. The message was
somewhat misleading in that it could be interpreted that RTD was delayed in their
opening. He has asked his PI to work with the PI for the opening of the Historical
Crawford hotel at DUS to make sure this announcement is clear. As we
understand the delay, the Crawford Hotel is ready and available for business but
the businesses that will occupy the space are not quite ready. Plans are to have
the Gala event as planned and the VIP reception on the 12th as noted. The official
opening to the public will be delayed. Chair Sisk shared that a question from the
CAC meeting was if the pedestrian bridge will be ready. His understanding is, not
until later but he asked GM Washington to confirm. Director James indicated his
understanding is it is the tenant finish that is delayed but that the hotel is ready to
go.
 General Manager Washington made a segue into the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI)
that is scheduled in Denver June 23-25. The Gala was planned for the DUS Grand
hall so he is not sure how this will be impacted. Relative to the CGI event itself, it
is his understanding that registration is by invitation only. They have been asked to
participate in the WIN and the Infrastructure of City and State component. They are
expecting approximately 800 people so he is not sure how Board members can
participate unless they have been invited.
 They have begun their summer intern and annual interns. This program has grown
to approximately 20 interns.
 Southeast extension (SE) — Staff plans to move this forward to put in the DRCOG
2014 plan. This is needed before RTD can apply for funds. The approval of the
DRCOG 2014 plan which includes SE says we support the move up of the SE
extension. This is a political decision but is very important to this organization. To
not approve this could be to forego approximately $92M in federal funds, and
$40M in stakeholders’ local contribution if you consider what they are offering in
cash and Right of Way (ROW). The Board needs to understand the significance of
this action and what we will be foregoing if not approved. This could also affect
the agency’s credibility. Foregoing the federal dollars with one of the largest local

Packet Pg. 53

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 19, 2014 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

III.

stakeholder’s contribution is huge. What the SE community is offering is roughly
16-17% match compared to the average 2.5% match, making this one of the
largest ever local match. General Manager Washington has received the letter of
commitment from the stakeholders and staff will bring it to the Board for
consideration on July 8.
Director Tobiassen indicated he is in full support of the Southeast extension project.
However, he will be out of the country and cannot vote.
Director Folska expressed her full support as well. She asked if this requires a
super-majority vote. General Manager Washington responded that he believes so
but will confirm.
Chair Sisk responded that he had this conversation with General Counsel Marla
Lien. Marla had indicated that since this is for planning purposes, it may not
require a super-majority. However, this could be challenged by the general public
or other Board members. In a precedent case, this issue was challenged and was
ruled in favor of a super-majority. Her recommendation would be to avoid this
potential issue, it would be better to have a super-majority vote.
Director James expressed that all we are doing is collaborating with DRCOG to
have Southeast in the plan and it does not give any more priority to this corridor
than the Central or any other. General Manager Washington responded it does
move Southeast up and gives it more priority. However, we need to do this to get
into the engineering phase of the program. In order to meet these dates, RTD must
have this in the 2014 DRCOG plan which is due in September.
Director Folska inquired what is the impact of the Federal Highway Trust Fund
going bankrupt on new starts. General Manager Washington indicated we are
already in the pipeline and the Federal Trust Fund deals with base systems. It
would have no impact on capital programs.
Chair Sisk acknowledged this is a political tug of war. However, this is a major
opportunity for RTD to move FasTracks forward. He anticipates some pushback
from the unfunded corridors but it does not make sense to forego $92M. We have
an objective to get to 10 votes on this issue to avoid any challenge later.


Paula Perdue, Executive Director for the Board Office, announced that in 2015,
RTD will be hosting the APTA Board Members and Board Support Conference in
Denver. They have begun galvanizing the team and have come up with a theme for
next year called “Elevate Denver 2015.” The ideas behind this theme has to do
with the things Denver is known for (i.e. mountains, outdoors, rafting, heights, etc.
combined with RTD’s position as on the leading edge with innovativeness, high
energy, moving forward, etc.). We will be introducing this theme, logo and doing a
promotional for Denver at the 2014 conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Director Walker
will be attending along with staff support Barbara McManus and Erin Klaas.

Retiree Awards
There were two retires for the month of May: Gene Barnett, Bus Operator with 22 years
of service, and Matt Vigil, Facilities Maintenance Mechanic with 20 years of service.
Neither one was able to attend the Board Meeting. Chair Sisk acknowledged the longevity
of RTD employees as the backbone and heart of the organization. He thanked the staff for
their work as they are partners more than employees.

V.

Public Participation


Scott McCarey, representing Boulder County, spoke in support of the Longmont
Fare Buy Up program. He thanked the RTD staff for its willingness to try
something new without knowing what to expect. He specifically thanked Brian
Matthews, Manager for Special Services, for his availability and can-do attitude.
He stated that this program will give a better understanding of the relationship
between fares and ridership in Longmont. He noted that a 2008 demographic
survey showed that 62% of Longmont riders have an annual income of $25,000 or
less. These are the individuals that will benefit from this pilot program. Chair Sisk
extended his thanks to the Boulder County Transportation staff and to Scott
McCarey for leading by example.



Indira Guzmán-Sais, representing Community Language Cooperative, encouraged
the Board to be more inclusive by providing interpretation services during all RTD
public meetings as well as translated materials.



Zoë Williams, representing 9 to 5, thanked the Board of Directors for listening to
her testimony and that of her peers. She recognized RTD staff’s decision to have
citizen’s input in the upcoming fare evaluation process. She asked the Board



Eva Hernández, representing Padres y Jóvenes Unidos, spoke in Spanish using a
translator. Her family depends on RTD for their transportation needs. Her oldest of
four children is a sophomore at Lincoln High School. She stated that she is very
proud of her son and his accomplishments; however, she is sad because at times,
she cannot allow him to go to after school classes and/or activities because they
cannot afford public transportation. She said that extra-curricular activities are an
important part of the college application process and pointed out it is unfair that
youth have to be denied from their studies and cultural activities due to this
problem. She encouraged the Board to not wait to make decisions that would help
families that cannot pay for public transportation now.



Doug Gragg, Denver, indicated that the $2.25 one-way fare inhibits people from
using public transportation. He suggested that the Fare Task Force include outside
participation and input. He noted that the pronunciation of the recording on the
16th Street Mall Ride is at times unintelligible. He also pointed out that the
announcement for the light rail on the 16th Street Mall Ride only says “connections
to the south” and makes no mention of the West line.



Chris Zivalich, representing 9 to 5, stated that he patrons RTD enthusiastically. He
recently was laid off and has found it difficult to afford the fares during his job
search, which at times demands multiple trips in one day. He spoke in favor of an
income-based fare. He noted that if a program of this nature was in practice, it
would help him during this hard time. He also said that he would gladly pay regular
fare once regularly employed.



Dean LeDoux, Denver, noted the area he lives in is mostly served by Route 16,
which has a lot of low income housing. He pointed out that riders have to pay for
the return trip even when the transfer slip is not expired. He also noted that the
303-299-6000 information line is awful. The recording does not understand the
prompts he gives. He thanked the Board for listening to his comments.



Laura Avant, Denver spoke on behalf of income based fares. She noted that she
and her husband live on social security income and must budget in order to take the
bus. She thought the fare was $2.20, not $2.25. Her husband found himself at
the doctor’s office without enough money to return home. Her husband, who has
a leg condition, had to walk over two miles home as she was unavailable to pick
him up.

members to be champions for lower fares as they also represent low income
citizens who pay for FasTracks. These constituents look up to the Directors for
guidance, support, and leadership.



VI.

Athena Rose, Denver spoke in favor of discounted RTD passes for employees of
entities such as AmeriCorps who are serving the community and receiving minimum
pay for their work. She stated that as a member of AmeriCorps she cannot afford
a monthly RTD pass.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington provided the following report:
 The ATU Northwest Regional Conference starts May 28th in Denver. The ATU has
asked General Manager Washington to address the conference. He noted the
significance of management being asked to address a Union Conference.
 The RTD FasTracks Annual Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Stakeholder and
Community Update is scheduled for May 28 th, 2014. He explained that in 2005
RTD put together a number of MOUs with the minority stakeholder groups around
the region after FasTracks was approved. As part of the MOU, RTD holds this
meeting every year. General Manager Washington estimates 250 stakeholders to
be in attendance.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was created in the fall of 2012 by
staff to look at our revenue enhancing opportunities through a Risk Allocation
Matrix (RAM). The Board approved three priorities for the use of this revenue if
realized: completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), building of the North Metro
Line to at least 72nd (which has now been exceeded as we are at 124th), and
utilizing any remaining funds above the $300 million goal to leverage potential
grants or private sector contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects. He
noted that even though the funding is not available yet, there is a money grab
attitude from different parties. He encouraged the Directors to review the
November 2012 Board Report. He believes the response to our stakeholders is that
RTD will live by the Board Report; RTD must see how much revenue is realized
through the FISA and RAM. He explained that when staff thinks there are enough
funds, they will present items to the Board for approval. General Manager
Washington reiterated that the Board will make the decision on what expenditures
get approved. He wants to clear up the misconception that staff is hoarding the
FISA funding.
o Director Lubow asked if her understanding of the FISA’s money not being
available until 2017 is correct. General Manager Washington answered that
it is not; staff plans to come to the Board when they feel there is enough
money for a significant project. Director Lubow inquired if the account is on
track for the $300 million estimate or if it is too early to tell. General
Manager Washington said it is too early; the Board has been briefed on the

Packet Pg. 61





account’s balance during the Finance Administration & Audit Committee
Meetings in the Monthly Financial Status Report.
o Director Folska remembers the RAM coming from the Fiscal Sustainability
Task Force. She stated that the Board members who started in 2013,
including herself, did not vote on the FISA and therefore might not
remember the full language of the RAM. Director Folska thought the goal of
the FISA and RAM was to complete FasTracks sooner rather than later. She
asked for further clarification as originally the goal was to build the North
Metro Line up to 72nd. She stated that the Line is now being built up to
124th, yet she recalls 104th also being mentioned. General Manager
Washington answered that the Risk Allocation Matrix was an exercise from
the Senior Leadership Retreat in 2012, not the Fiscal Sustainability Task
Force. He also said that the original goal was 72 nd. Through innovative
financing, the boundary was extended to 124th. Marla Lien, General
Counsel, noted that the Certificates of Participation (COPs), if approved, will
finance up to 104th. Terry Howerter added that besides the COPs, there is
an anticipated $23 million in-kind contribution from local governments, $169
million from previously issued sales tax bonds, and $85 million in cash for a
total of $708 million for the project.
o Director Folska asked if the $135 million allocated for US 36 BRT has been
already used and if the project could be considered completed. General
Manager Washington said that the money allocated has been used but he
would not say the project is complete.
o Director Hoy confirmed with General Manager Washington that the
document with the FISA goals was from November 29, 2012.
o Director Lubow asked about the possibility of the FISA funding up to 162 nd.
General Manager Washington replied that it could. Staff will come to the
Board with a recommendation depending on what the market dictates to do
next. Ultimately it is a Board decision.
o Chair Sisk asked for clarification on the final numbers allocated for the US
36 BRT. Marla Lien replied that $135 million was allocated to High
Performance Transportation Enterprise (HPTE) for the construction of the
managed lanes. She believes RTD has over $145 million in the total project.
Other Matters:
o Management has received feedback on ideas and potential improvements
regarding DUS. Considering the magnitude of the project, the modifications
will be minor.
 Director Tobiassen extended his gratitude to all the volunteers who
braved the weather in order to serve during the DUS operational
openings.

The DBJ article on Terry Howerter, who has been an integral part of the
FasTracks project, was a great article. He commented that everyone at RTD
is very proud of Terry Howerter.
Former Bus Operations Manager Martha Hecox passed away on May 6 th,
2014. She was a great asset to the District for 20 years.
 Director Daly invited the Directors to the celebration of Martha
Hecox’s life. He remembered her as the first women in our District,
as well as nationally, to be an Operations Director. Her first job with
RTD was doing ride checks.
Fare Task Force
 Chair Sisk asked when the Board could expect to see a progress
report of the internal fare review. General Manager Washington
answered that the Board could expect a progress report before the
end of the year. Public input is schedule for the last half of 2015.
Board approval will be needed during the beginning of 2016.
 Director Lubow asked for clarification as she recalled there would be
quarterly reports. General Manager Washington said that there would
be quarterly reports during the Operations & Customer Service
committee meetings. He thought the Chair was referring to an interim
plan. Chair Sisk noted that Director Lubow captured his question
better.
 Director Deadwyler expressed her concern over the length of the time
line. She suggested the process be streamlined and not extended to
the 2016 openings. General Manager Washington reported the Task
Force has been formed. Staff would like to hire a consultant to look
through all the details as this would help the project to be well
thought through. A 2016 deadline would give enough time for
implementing any new technology.
 Director Deadwyler also noted the possible conflict of interest as the
Fare Task Force and the group considering a fare increase are the
same. General Manager Washington clarified that it is only one group
who will be reviewing the fares and proposing changes, if any.
 Director Solano noted that Citizens Advisory Committee members and
RTD Directors are not represented on the Task Force. He suggested
additional stakeholders’ and Director’s participation as outside
influence and “devil’s advocate”. General Manager Washington
noted the process is similar to our service change process, which is
done 3 times a year: staff drafts a plan for the Directors and the
public to review (as outside influences), the plan is redrafted with
feedback received and then the final changes are presented to the
Directors for their consideration.

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this memorandum is to request an amendment to the 2014 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from 2013 to 2014. The amendment also
will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and administrative
budget.

DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2014 Budget Amendment

Packet Pg. 72

11.A

The total proposed appropriation for the 2014 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2014
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2014 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $13.6 million from the 2014 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $9.8 million on the
Base System, $2.6 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $1.3 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, and Free MetroRide). Of the total increase, $1.0 million is attributed
to previously approved transfers. On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less
than 1% net of previously approved transfers and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes are summarized below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $0.615 million for increases in repair parts, materials and supplies, tech services
contracts, addition of dispatcher positions, and previously approved transfers
Rail Operations

offset by previously approved transfers
Communications-Base
 Net increase of $0.520 million for corrections to the 2014 budget from inadvertent reductions in

Packet Pg. 74

11.A

Safety, Security & Facilities-FasTracks Operations
 Net increase of $0.956 million for DUS operating costs allocated to FasTracks Operations
Debt Service
Interest expense is projected to remain stable on a combined basis with no change. Capitalized interest
as well is expected to show no change. COPs debt issued in 2014 for Base and FasTracks is projected
to begin amortizing in 2015. Principal payments on base system debt are projected to increase
minimally by $0.729 million due to updated debt amortization schedules.
2014 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $3.8 million over the
2014 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2014
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of an increase in Base of $32.3 million. Additions to new capital funding
include $32.7 million for restoration of funding for the articulated and transit buses that were subject of
a budget transfer to advance fund the intercity buses for BRT originally scheduled for purchase in 2016.
Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of a decrease of $28.6 million. This results from updated
project schedules for the North Metro and I-225 projects that changed the projected expenditures in
2014, adjustments for grant funding, and changes in cost estimates. Additions to new capital funding
include $18.1 million for additional commuter rail vehicles for the Eagle project approved by the Board in
December 2013, $4.7 million for light rail vehicle storage tracks for I-225 approved by the Board in April
2014, and $1.0 million for Peoria Interface coordination approved by the Board as part of the Annual
Program Evaluation in May 2014. Please see Attachment B for detail.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2014 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/13 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2014 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/13
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2013.
Previously approved capital carryforward is decreased by $136.9 million from the 2014 Adopted Budget
to reflect fourth quarter 2013 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects as
expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The Base System portion is a decrease of $8.4 million and the FasTracks decrease is $128.6 million.
Please see Attachment C for detail.

11.A

Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $20.5 million on a combined basis from the
2014 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $0.360 million based on the CU-Leeds
School March forecast of 7.4% vs. 7.5% in the Adopted Budget.
Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to decrease $20.7 million over amounts
projected in the 2014 Adopted Budget. This reflects decreasing allocations on the Base System
in fixed guideway, CMAQ-STAMPS, FASTER grants and Bus Facilities funding from the 2014
Adopted Budget, offset by increases in FTA State of Good Repair funding. FasTracks allocated
grants are expected to remain stable.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals run rate.
Other income is projected to remain stable at $20.7 million.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $14.1 million from the Adopted Budget to
$9.4 million reflecting amended budget increases, year-end accruals and the net pension obligation.

FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2014 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues

Packet Pg. 76

11.A

divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2014 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund on the Base System are reduced from $5.0 million to each fund to $3.0 million to
each fund in 2014.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2014 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2014 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2014 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2014 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

Board Meeting Date: June 24, 2014

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 4060’ Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in
an amount not to exceed $26,720,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 40 additional
60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 14 years old and have accumulated on average 406,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have become
unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. Many of the parts required for the
repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the
replacement of the 9100 Series buses over three years, 40 buses in 2013, 40 buses in 2014 and 18
buses in 2015.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement was
the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17, 2013.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the
purchase option for a guaranteed quantity of 40 additional articulated buses.
DISCUSSION
The 60’ articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger

Packet Pg. 104

12.B

count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 55
passenger seats and two spaces for storage of large items such as child stroller and shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the purchase option for
a guaranteed quantity of 40 articulated buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $26,720,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2014
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to New Flyer for the purchase of
forty (40) additional articulated buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 11040' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053
with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $46,428,700 for the purchase of 110 additional 40’ transit
buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 14 years old and have accumulated on average 610,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus
manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts required
for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for
the replacement of the Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014
and 64 buses in 2015.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an
inflationary price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or
PPI which is published monthly.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a guaranteed quantity of 110 additional 40’ transit buses.
DISCUSSION
The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger

12.C

count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as child stroller and shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
guaranteed quantity of 110-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $46,428,700. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2014
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the

Approval of NAMS Recommendation

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution, which accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the
Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.
Implementation of these priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.
BACKGROUND
In April 2013, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. RTD engaged HNTB Corp. to serve as
the lead consultant in March 2013.
The study had five key tasks as described below:
1. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor
and determine what, if any, BRT elements are needed to achieve full BRT in the corridor;
2. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail in
segments;
3. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Corridor from SH 7 to Longmont;
4. Evaluate potential for early implementation mobility improvements in the area, such as arterial
BRT; and
5. Conduct a high-level analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown Express
lanes.
The study was governed by:
1. A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), made up of staff members from the northwest area
local jurisdictions, CDOT, DRCOG, the University of Colorado Boulder, 36 Commuting
Solutions and the North Area Transportation Alliance (NATA); and
2. A Policy Advisory Committee, made up of the elected officials from the local jurisdictions, as
well as a representative from CDOT, the 36 Commuting Solutions Board of Directors, NATA
and the RTD Board members representing Districts within the study area (Directors Anderson,
Hoy, Lubow and Sisk).
RTD staff, the consultant and the stakeholders contributed significant input throughout the study.
At the final PAC meeting held on April 18, 2014, the stakeholders came to a consensus on how to

Packet Pg. 108

13.D

move forward with transit improvements in the northwest area. A Consensus Statement was
developed to document the principles and priorities that the stakeholders desired.
DISCUSSION
The Consensus Statement includes a section that discusses general principles and a section which
discusses prioritization of potential projects.
General Principles
The Consensus Statement general principles are as follows:
• An overarching theme serves as a basis from which consensus on the priorities is grounded:
The Northwest area remains committed to Northwest Rail, as envisioned in FasTracks. Given
the projected timing of Northwest Rail’s implementation, the Northwest stakeholders want to
see mobility benefits sooner.
• Projects on this prioritized list should not be considered absolutely sequential. Nothing should
preclude the pursuit or acceleration of any of these priorities should viable opportunities or
partners become available. More than one priority can be pursued simultaneously. RTD
should be proactive, aggressive and creative in monitoring these projects for any significant
developments that help a project move forward, such as public or P3 funding opportunities.
Priorities
The Consensus Statement’s priorities are as follows:
1. Completion of the Remaining US 36 BRT Commitments – These are the commitments that
were included in the Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit, as approved by the
RTD Board of Directors September 17, 2013.
2. Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service – Proceed into advanced planning, environmental
clearance and preliminary engineering via submittal of TIGER Planning Grant (submitted April
28, 2014) for SH 119 from Longmont to Boulder as the first priority; and US 287 (as selected
by staff, based on cost effectiveness and ridership) as the next priority. One or both corridors
could be implemented following the next phase of study based on further refinement of
regional priorities, project scopes, funding availability and leveraging opportunities.
3. North I-25/Downtown Express Reverse Commute Solutions – In the short-term, RTD should
work with CDOT to advance a bus-on-shoulder concept. For the long-term, advanced
planning for systematic improvements should be initiated for this segment of I-25.
4. Northwest Rail – The stakeholders recognize the present funding challenges and
accompanying near-term inability to secure an agreement with the BNSF. However, as noted
above, completion of Northwest Rail, while a longer term goal, remains a priority. On an
annual basis, RTD will explore and update Northwest Rail implementation strategies and
report to stakeholders and the public.
5. Remaining Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service Corridors – This priority would be a long-term
goal depending on funding availability and further refinement of regional goals, project scopes,
funding availability and leveraging opportunities. These corridors include:
a. SH 7 from Boulder to I-25
b. 120th Avenue from Broomfield to I-25
c. S. Boulder Rd from Boulder to I-25
d. SH 42/95th Street in the Louisville area
e. 28th Street/Broadway Arterial BRT/Enhanced Bus Service improvements.

Packet Pg. 109

13.D

North Metro Extension from SH 7 to Longmont
Given the high estimated cost, combined with projected low ridership, the stakeholders opted not to
proceed with any action that would advance the North Metro Rail Extension (from SH 7 to
Longmont) at this time. They recommended that the corridor should be re-evaluated in the future if
population densities or other conditions change.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact directly related to this action; however, should the Board at a later date, and
after further study, opt to move forward with specific recommendations from the Consensus, there will
be a financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached resolution, which accepts
the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study
stakeholders for priorities within the Northwest Study Area.
Implementation of these
priorities will be subject to future Board consideration and approval.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
accepts the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the Northwest Area Mobility Study
stakeholders. This action is not recommended given the considerable commitment on the part
of RTD and the stakeholders to reach this consensus, which provides RTD a path forward for
implementing mobility improvements in the Northwest area.

ACCEPTING THE CONSENSUS STATEMENT OF THE NORTHWEST AREA
MOBILITY STUDY STAKEHOLDERS
Whereas, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose
of the study was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
and the Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area;
Whereas, the Northwest area stakeholders and RTD executed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) dated January 14, 2013. The MOU included a stakeholder involvement plan for achieving
consensus;
Whereas, RTD and the stakeholders analyzed a wide variety of alternatives to address the study
purpose; and
Whereas, the Northwest area stakeholders formulated the attached Final Consensus Statement,
which was endorsed on April 18, 2014, to document the principles and priorities which the stakeholders
desired for mobility improvements in the Northwest area; and
Whereas, RTD has submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) grant to pursue advanced planning on two of the high-priority Bus Rapid Transit corridors
identified in the Final Consensus Statement.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors accepts the attached Final Consensus Statement as developed by
the Northwest Area Mobility Study stakeholders and presented to the Board Planning & Development
Committee on May 13, 2014; and
RTD will be proactive, aggressive and creative so as to advance the recommendations and
priorities as described in the Final Consensus Statement, with implementation of these priorities subject to
future RTD Board consideration and approval.
