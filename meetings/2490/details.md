## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Tobiassen noted there were seven retirees this month with four in attendance.

General Manager Genova stated that the retirees covered several different departments in RTD and asked the various Assistant General Manager’s to come forward to present their retiree to the Board.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, recognized Casandra Santos for her 28 years of service.  He noted that Communications is sad to see her leave, but happy that she can move on to the next stage in her life.  He commented that it has been a pleasure working with Casandra and she has done a remarkable job over the years.

Will Adams, Senior Manager of Customer Care, explained that on his third day at RTD in 2013, he met Casandra.  At their first meeting, the first word out of her mouth was that her name was spelled with only one S.  She was a pleasure to work with and together they made a lot of great changes.  He congratulated her and indicated that she will be greatly missed.

Casandra Santos indicated that she started when the Alameda facility was open and she was one of the first employees at District Shops.  She claimed that this was the shortest 28 years that she has ever seen.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, celebrated Brenda Tierney for her 29 years of service with RTD.  He added that Public Information is her forte, but that was not her only accomplishment.  Brenda assisted with the Central Rail Line, she spend five years managing the Board Office and was always ready to stretch the limits to ensure our ridership was well served.  He noted that after her time at RTD, Brenda will begin working at CIS Communications to assist CDOT.

Scott Reed remarked that Brenda was a hybrid employee because she was part of both the Planning and Public Information teams.  She was always her own manager, which was the best thing that could have happened as she was a rare person who could handle any situation.  She has always done things her own way and has been extremely successful.  Brenda will be greatly missed.

Brenda Tierney stated that she was touched by Bill’s and Scott’s words.  She indicated it was an honor and privilege to have RTD as a part of her life for almost 30 years.  She thanked everyone and noted that everyone would be missed.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, commended Philip Zike for his 36 years of service at RTD.  He noted that Philip has been married for 40 years and has one daughter and one granddaughter.  Rumor has it that Philip will be enjoying golfing, camping and drag racing during his retirement.  Bruce said all of Philip’s years of service are greatly appreciated.

Philip Zike remarked that he was very lucky to work at RTD for as long as he did.  He added that if he had the opportunity to do it again, he would do it all the same way.

Bruce Abel stated that Marie Washington, another long time stalwart, was retiring after 33 years of service.  He noted that in her long RTD career, Marie was a bus operator, street supervisor, light rail operator and a transportation manager.  He shared that after her retirement, she plans to spend time with her family, travelling and focusing on her volunteer work.  He added that Marie has been a big part of the RTD family and she will be greatly missed.

Marie Washington thanked everyone and said it was an honor and a privilege to work for the District for 33 years.  She added that every day she worked with remarkable people.  She thanked everyone for the opportunity and sent out her blessings to the Board and staff.

General Manager Genova noted that the other retirees were not able to attend the Board meeting to receive their plaques.  He stated that their commitment to RTD was great and they will be missed.

Chair Tobiassen acknowledged Susan Beiker, Property Accountant with 38 years of services, Helen Casillas, Senior Materials Management Specialist with 38 years of service, and Gail Nadius, Bus Operator with 30 years of service, who were unable to attend this evening.  He pointed out that the number of years of service for all of this month’s retirees was stunning.  He appreciates all they have done for RTD.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the Board.  He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, shared that he had two topics to discuss with the Board. First was that he found a new hobby and he would be attending the Denver City Council meetings as their meetings are much more exciting than RTD Board Meetings.  Second, he noted that the University of Colorado A Line had a pronounced non-compliance enforcement behavior.  He indicated that if you appear to be a local and have not validated your ticket, a fare enforcement officer will make you get off the train at the next stop.  However, if you appear to be a visitor, the fare enforcement officer will only give a warning.  He stated there should be uniform treatment for everybody.

- Trupti Suthour, Denver, explained that one of the reasons she moved to the Sunnyside neighborhood was for the commuter rail stop.  She shared that she recently learned the B Line was not going to stop at the 41st and Fox Station, which was news to her and to others in her community.  She indicated she is encouraging her community and local businesses to email the Board about this stop.  She noted that Sunnyside is undergoing a transformation and they want it to be a destination.  She asked that the Board reconsider having the B Line stop there.

- Alex Ryan, Northglenn, explained that he works for EnerBurn and they can save RTD 8-15% in fuel costs by incorporating an additive to the diesel fuel mix.  He noted that other transit agencies, such as Houston Metro, are currently using this service and have seen significant savings with their fuel costs.  He asked to meet with someone from the RTD staff to discuss his company further.

## XIV. Executive Session

There was no executive session.

## XV. Old Business

No old business was discussed.

## XVI. New Business

Director Archuleta noted he has been receiving a lot of emails concerning the B Line and the fact that it does not stop at the 41st and Fox station.  He asked staff for more information.

General Manager Genova explained that the B Line is not part of the federally funded project like the G Line and the University of Colorado A Line are.  He added that the construction of the 41st and Fox station, as well as the Pecos Junction station, were under the G Line construction project.  For the B Line opening, those two stations will be fenced off and closed to the public.  He added that in the 2010 operating plan, the B Line was not going to stop at those stations; but staff is evaluating that plan now and if a change occurs it will require a change order to the concessionaire agreement.

Director Archuleta indicted that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, had shared the results of a B Line ridership study with the Board and asked for additional details of those results.  Bill Van Meter explained that the study Director Archuleta referenced examined the initial ridership demand for the B Line.  The study identified the need for the B Line to stop at those two intermediary stops when the B Line is extended north to Longmont.

Director Bagley shared that he attended the BisNow event on the 22nd concerning real estate issues in downtown Denver.  He added that light rail and commuter rail traffic was mentioned as being very important for high density, multi-family residential development

Director Francone shared that she attended Accelerate Colorado.  She explained she went because it is a different type of conference in comparison to the APTA Legislative.  The Accelerate Conference has about 100 Colorado executives, government members, etc. and this assembly has one voice that is influential in a way that APTA is not.  This group draws from different segments of the Colorado economy and those differences present a stronger voice to legislatures.  She added that she was able to meet with Jefferson County Commissioner Rosier as well as the management group in charge of the Gaylord of The Rockies.  She indicated that in order to maintain and build upon these relationships, face to face meetings are crucial.

Director Sisk thanked RTD and the Board for what has been done for the University of Colorado A Line.  He indicated that the transition at DIA is fantastic, but noted that queuing is an issue and suggested that ropes be installed to make sure people who were waiting first are not pushed out of the way.

Director James thanked Director Lubow for sharing an article about the initiatives by Alphabet, owned by Google.  The article discussed the transformation of mobility and he reiterated his concern that RTD needs to leave, follow or get out of the way for new technology like this.

Director Bagley thanked Director Francone for her Accelerate Colorado update.  He added that he is receiving positive responses for the University of Colorado A Line, but noted that the overhead luggage racks do not work very well.  He further added that the signs list the airport as Denver Airport instead of Denver International Airport and asked that staff look at updating the signs so as not to confuse travelers.

Director Deadwyler noted that she too has received positive comments for the University of Colorado A Line.  She also thanked Barbara McManus, Acting Executive Director for the Board Office, and Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, for organizing the Juneteenth festivities.  She commented that staff rarely hears the acclamations that they should receive.

Chair Tobiassen thanked Director Deadwyler and Director Folska for attending the R Line open house.  He added that he would prepare his trip report for Accelerate Colorado as he has done in the past and provide it to the other Directors.
