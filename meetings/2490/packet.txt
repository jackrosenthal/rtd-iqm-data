B. Recommended Actions

• Extension of Aconex Contract to 2020
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to
execute all documents necessary to award a three-year contract in the
amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in the
total amount not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and
Operational Management Software as a Service. Funding for this contract
was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the June 28, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
introduced Henry Stopplecamp and Lisa Dorrance to discuss
this action item with the Board. Bruce Abel noted that as the
P&D and FasTracks committee meetings were cancelled last
week, this action item was included with tonight’s agenda.
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting General Manager of Capital
Programs & Facilities, explained that RTD currently has a
contract in place with Aconex as the document repository for
the FasTracks program. Their contract began in 2010 and
staff is asking that the Board approve an amendment to
extend the contract for another three years with three

Chair Tobiassen and Directors Folska, Francone and Lasater were absent. Directors Lubow
and Sisk arrived late.

6.A

Lisa Dorrance, Acting Manager of Enterprise Records and
Information, reiterated that Aconex has been the repository of
records for FasTracks since 2010. RTD originally purchased
the system with the intent of loading 12 FasTracks projects,
which has now grown to 48. This software service works
very well and staff has been able to provide use of this system
to our stakeholders. Currently, 669 organizations use Aconex,
which encompass various municipalities and contractors that
work on FasTracks projects. RTD has been able to offer
Aconex to those organizations for free and this system has
worked out very well. It is in the best interest of FasTracks
and Commuter Rail to maintain consistency by continuing to
utilize this system.

C. Updates

• Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that as the
Board is aware, three times a year there are conversations regarding service
changes that are based on RTD’s service standards. RTD’s Service
Standards are objective criterion which help the agency communicate with
constituents in an objective fashion about RTD’s services. Questions staff
frequently asks are: where should we provide service, what services should
we provide and how are those services doing when they are provided. He
shared the last time this came before the Board was in the early 2000s. He
said there have been a number of changes in recent years so Staff is
presenting a few suggested changes to the Policy and Standards. This is
not being presented for adoption, but as an overview so the Board may ask
questions. Staff will come back at a later committee meeting to ask for
approval. He further noted that it is important to recognize that the
Standards are subject to RTD’s financial realities which provide the ultimate
standard in regards to what RTD can or cannot do. He noted a redlined

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

additional one-year options. He further added that staff is
trying to keep the same system in place in an effort to keep
records management stable.

6.A

Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, noted that RTD has
had the Service Policies and Standards in place for a long time and that it
has served the agency well. This document provides a rational answer to
why constituents cannot have certain services. The last major revision to
the Service Policies and Standards occurred in 2009; however, a lot has
happened since then. RTD has acquired a lot of new technology which has
allowed us to get more ridership data and to analyze that data better. He
added that FTA regulations have either been added or evolved and RTD must
comply with those. RTD has developed a few policies for shuttles and
circulators, but they have not been officially incorporated into our Service
Policies and Standards. Additionally, he mentioned that RTD has changed
its services quite a bit with the deployment of the FasTracks corridors and
fare media restructuring. He highlighted the following changes:
 Express, Regional and SkyRide service classes reassigned into either
Reginal or Local service
 Urban and suburban classifications defined
 Minimum Service Frequency standard added for Rail and Bus Rapid
Transit
 Maximum Load Standard (Crowding) defined by research on
comfortable passenger space
 Access-a-Ride requirements outlined
 Reliability defined as on time is one minute early to five minutes late
 Minimum Service Levels were added for the Call-n-Ride Service
 Shuttle and Circulator guidelines and requirements added
 Service Change Process outlined
 Cost Sharing Policy included based on financial feasibility, vehicle
availability, local government and community support and
performance requirements
Bruce Abel commented that the Board should contact Jeff Becker or anyone
on the service development team with questions. He added that some of the
revisions are procedural in nature in order to incorporate policies that RTD
has been following but are not part of the Service Policies and Standards
document.
Director Lubow said she does not understand most of the revisions because
the Policies and Standards are so dense. She added that a review of the
Policies and Standards would be beneficial during a Board Study Session to
ensure the entire Board understood this document.
Director Lubow indicated that something is coming up in Longmont and she
wants to make sure that she is not approving something that could

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Agenda Packet.

potentially hurt service there. Boulder County is going to be pulling out of
subsidizing the fare buy up and Longmont may not have the funds to pay for
difference so she wants to keep options open around this program. She
added that she is concerned if she approves the updated Service Policies and
Standards that might reduce Longmont’s options. Jeff Becker explained the
Policies and Standards were set up in a way that would allow RTD to work
with the City of Longmont on a modified fare buy up program. He added
that the Service Policies and Standards were not being approved tonight, but
indicated that the Cost Sharing Policy within the Policies and Standards will
set the guidelines for the Agency to follow. He noted that RTD solicited the
opinions of our various cities, counties, etc. regarding the proposed Service
Policies and Standards.
Bruce Abel reiterated that staff was not asking for any action this evening.
Staff will bring this item back to the Board next month for approval and
added that this has been sent out to 38 municipalities and 8 counties.
Director Menten noted that in the addition to section 2.1 of the Service
Policies and Standards, it states that Regional class includes routes providing
high-speed service on limited access highways and inquired if there were
any times Regional service might be provided on a different type of road.
She further inquired if this wording would potentially prevent needed
services elsewhere. Bruce Abel explained this was more a characteristic of
the service than a classification of the highway.
Director Menten further inquired about section 2.3.5 regarding the vehicle
assignment targets for the 27’ to 30’ buses. She believes these are the
Call-n-Ride buses but wondered if they were being used for any local routes.
Jeff Becker indicated that they were being used in Longmont for a while and
the route through Stapleton. Director Menten mentioned she was asking
because she receives complaints from constituents asking why RTD does
not utilize smaller buses for routes with lower ridership.
Director Walker thanked staff for sending this out to the various jurisdictions
and municipalities.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for the outline of all of the
revisions, especially when it comes to outlining the Shuttle and Circulator
guidelines. She noted that she needed further clarification about revisions
asked a member of staff contact her to discuss.

• 16th Street Mall Summer Activities 2016
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that staff would be working with the City
and County of Denver and the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) to
provide alternative services for five weekends this summer while they
conducted “Meet the Street” events. The summer activities calendar
Packet Pg. 11

6.A

Bruce Abel explained that as part of our measurement activities, staff is
undertaking intercept surveys. The purpose of the surveys is to intercept
people on the Mall to ask them a series of questions regarding their
perception about what is going on in Downtown Denver over the weekends
this summer.
Director Archuleta inquired if there were going to be any good concerts
during the Meet the Street activities. Bruce Abel noted that there are a
variety of musical activities that will take place throughout the summer and
further information can be found on the Downtown Denver Partnership’s
website.
Director James mentioned that he had taken a trip with the Downtown
Denver Partnership to New York City to visit the Fulton Street Mall. He
noted that it was an interesting comparison to Denver’s 16th Street Mall.

• University of Colorado A-Line Ridership Update
Bruce Abel explained that as part of staff’s continuing efforts to keep the
Board apprised of the ridership of the University of Colorado A-Line, ridership
statistics have been included in the Board packet. Ridership totals are
included through the sixth week of operations and weekly ridership totals
averaged over 16,000 riders per day. Staff has had conversations regarding
some of the service interruptions and will continue to provide the Board with
information as it is available.
General Manager Genova added that over the last few days there were a
few incidents with the University of Colorado A-Line which impacted
service. Last night a train operator reported a lightning strike and thought
they had observed one of the overhead power lines come down. With that
information, the Controller made the decision to stop train traffic until the
overhead power lines could be evaluated. A team was immediately
dispatched to assess that the situation to determine if there was an issue
which required immediate attention. General Manager Genova stated on a
more important note, the power system acted as it was designed to work.
It sensed the fault with the lightning strike, the breaker opened, and the
system closed the breakers automatically and power was back up. General

exceeds five weekends activating the Downtown area throughout the
summer, not just for the five weekends that RTD is working with the City
and DDP to divert the Mall Shuttles. He noted that staff has also had
significant conversations regarding measuring the results of not only the five
weeks that RTD is doing alternative services but for the entire summer when
regular service is provided. Included in the packet is a description of each
event throughout the summer, beginning May 28, 2016 and ending Labor
Day weekend. For example, staff wants to measure the impact of a Rockies
weekend against a non-Rockies weekend.

6.A

General Manager Genova explained that another recent incident was due to
a false fire alarm at the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). The
CRMF had to evacuate until Denver Fire could determine if the alarm was an
actionable alarm or not. Denver Transit Partners (DTP) managed that event
by evacuating the building and calling all trains to get to the closest station
to await further instruction. It took 20 minutes to get the all clear from
Denver Fire before the trains could resume operations. RTD staff has
reviewed how DTP managed these two events and think there are some
things DTP can learn about managing these types of situations more
efficiently.
General Manager Genova further highlighted that while individual incidents
on the University of Colorado A-Line are garnering a lot of attention, what is
not being focused on is the overall on-time performance. In week one, the
average on-time performance was 90%. For week two it was 95% and
week three was 96%. There were a few bad weeks while DTP made
modifications to the system to improve efficiencies. Week four was at 82%
and week five was 77%. But then in week six it jumped back up to 96%
and week seven was at 93%. Out of the seven weeks that the University
of Colorado A Line has been in operations, there have been five weeks
where the on-time performance is 90% or greater. If the seven week
average is examined, on-time performance is at 89%. While that needs to
be better, these numbers are not being broadcast by the media. He added
that staff has discussed hosting an operations workshop so that RTD can
assist DTP in responding better to scenarios and make the proper
adjustments to give our patrons a better experience.
Director Archuleta commented that he was having an issue with the multiple
lightning strikes and asked for staff to explain the issue to him. General
Manager Genova explained that for last night’s incident, the system worked
as it was designed. If not for the train operator reporting to the control
center that a power line was down, the system would have continued to
work just fine. He further noted that there was one other incident due to a
lightning strike that caused a burned through wire. That wire has been sent
to the lab for testing to determine if it was indeed from a lightning strike or
if it was from something else and staff is awaiting those results.
Director Archuleta expressed that he still did not understand why lightning
strikes were a problem if the system was grounded properly. Henry
Stopplecamp, Acting AGM of Capital Programs, explained that the entire
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Manager Genova said the reason for the delay in service was because
Denver Transit Partners was being very cautious and safe in how they
managed the situation. This resulted in a bus bridge from 40th and Colorado
to DIA for two hours, but for the rest of the system the trains were
operational with only a 30 minute delay.

6.A

Director Lubow indicated that while RTD has good on-time service averages,
there have been a series of problems which the public are concerned about.
These issues are affecting RTD’s reputation and the public’s concerns are
not being addressed. She said it seems like prior line openings did not have
as many issues. General Manager Genova commented that each line has
required its own adjustments; it is not atypical to have issues when a line is
opened. He stated he is not satisfied with the level of service and staff is
working diligently to improve it. He added that he is also concerned about
our reputation and noted that some of his comments recently used by the
media were taken out of context.
Director Lubow commented that Colorado is a high lighting strike state and
it is important to get this right. Henry Stopplecamp indicated that staff is
working with the contractor. He stated there are issues with lightning on
light rail as well but RTD has had 22 years to learn what to look out for.
The commuter rail system is a brand new system so it is a learning process
for DTP. Service is not where it should be, but staff is pushing for it to be
better. He added that if you examine the trends for DTP’s operations, it is
getting better.
Director Deadwyler mentioned that she too has concerns for the University
of Colorado A-Line. She commented that she has received quite a few
phone calls regarding on-time performance, especially when constituents
cannot get to work on time. She added that the people she has talked to
still have faith in the system and want it to work properly. She noted that
one of the things RTD did not do well was to warn the public in advance
that there would be issues with the new commuter rail system and ask for
their patience. She was happy to hear that staff is conversing daily with
DTP, but surprised to learn that DTP is learning as they go as she thought
they had been training people all along so they were ready for operations.
She asked that staff bring DTP to a Board meeting in the future so that DTP
can explain certain issues to the Board. She said another concerning item
was the false fire alarm at the CRMF as this is supposed to be state of the
art technology. She asked how much of the current issues are related to
operator error versus system issues. She reiterated that her constituents
still believe in the system, but they want to get to work on time; however,
an honest message needs to be communicated to the public that they should
expect a few bumps along the way for the next few months so they are not
surprised.
Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

system is grounded with the exception of the live wire. Last night when the
lightning hit, it hit a surge, the breaker tripped and the system reset itself.
This is how this system is supposed to work and unfortunately there have
been two incidents where lightning has hit the live wire. He added that staff
would be happy to sit down with the Board to answer questions in more
detail.

6.A

Director Walker commended the operator for calling in what he/she thought
was a downed wire. He added that since this is a new system there are
things out there that operators might not be familiar with. He would rather
operators be safe and overly cautious to keep the riders safe. He added that
all transportation systems have their individual problems and faults, but he
still encourages his friends to ride RTD.
Director Menten asked if the original plans for the commuter rail always
included two sub-stations. General Manager Genova indicated yes, and it
was part of the 30% preliminary design established by RTD. Henry
Stopplecamp explained that the system is designed to run off of one substation, so the second sub-station is actually a redundancy.
Director Menten said she had only seen one picture of the severed wire that
was currently being used by the media. She asked if that was an authentic
or generic photo. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, explained that it was the actual photo taken by DTP. He
said there were two photos; one showed the wire dangling from the
overhead catenary, and the other showed where it was severed after it was
taken down.
Committee Chair Anderson added that she is extremely concerned about
RTD’s reputation and she appreciates what staff is doing to make sure that
the system will be running on time. She added that she travels a lot in the
Denver metro area and she recently heard RTD being compared to WMATA
(Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority), which she did not like.

• Mobility Choice
Bruce Abel indicated that there have been a lot of changes in regards to
mobility in recent years such as Uber, Lyft, automated cars, connected cars,
etc. The world of technology is changing the way in which people move.
There are many conversations taking place about how these new
technologies are impacting individual and community mobility. The Smart
City Challenge grant application was submitted to the U.S. Department of
Transportation over a week ago and staff is still waiting for the results. This
grant application is potentially for $50-$60 million dollars for the City of
Denver.

Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Henry Stopplecamp said he appreciates the faith of the community. He
indicated that the fire alarm at the CRMF was in the building itself. He
stated one thing DTP took away from that situation was that they needed a
“go-bag” so that they could run the control center outside of the CRMF in
the event of an emergency.

Bruce Abel added that there is another conversation happening at the local
level and it is titled “Mobility Choice”. This is being led by the Denver
Chamber of Commerce, and the partners in the conversation are: Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT), Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) and RTD. He noted that staff is actively engaged in
conversations with our partners in relation this initiative. Regardless of the
outcome of the Smart Cities grant application, the community as a whole
wants to make sure it is thinking about how new technology is impacting
the community’s ability to move. He said a Request for Information (RFI)
had been issued and one of the elements was to evaluate strategies to look
at technology and how it impacts mobility in the Denver metro area. He
stated the Denver Metro Chamber and private sector have pledged money to
move forward with engagement of a consultant and there are conversations
about how RTD, DRCOG and CDOT might participate financially as well.
General Manager Genova added that this discussion begin with RTD when
Director Sisk was Chair. There are two pages that precede the PowerPoint
included in the June 14, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee
Agenda Packet which outline the original concept. There has been an
ongoing dialog amongst the various participants about the need for
additional funding. He said the more he thinks about this effort the more
important he thinks it is for RTD to have a seat at the table. If RTD does not
participate, RTD will not have a say in the planning efforts for future years.
Bruce Abel added that procedurally, this group is looking at forming a private
non-profit with a Board of Directors that would have both public and private
sector participants.
Director Menten inquired about the potential 2018 ballot measure mentioned
and asked if staff could provide more details. Bruce Abel indicated that staff
is not in position to discuss the measure at the present time other than all
options are being considered. The consultant selected would determine if
that was a viable alternative. General Manager Genova added that it is very
early in the process and that these are all possibilities or potentials as
nothing has been solidified.
Director James noted he was happy to see RTD be a full partner at the table
with our peers. He pointed out that there are other private and public sector
entities which were not mentioned that are at the table. He added that we
are on the threshold of dramatic changes in the way transportation functions
and serves the community.

• Recent FTA Guidance Regarding ADA Accessibility and Bus Stop/Shelters
Bruce Abel noted that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has always
provided guidance to ensure that transit related services are accessible to
individuals with disabilities. The FTA issues guidance and publishes circulars
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.A

6.A

Bruce Abel explained the ability to accommodate requests to move bus
stops or shelters is now vastly constrained because any movement of an
existing stop or shelter must be in compliance with ADA standards. The
circular acknowledges that agencies like RTD do not control all of the
elements of accessibility such as sidewalk construction, but RTD must work
with our partners to ensure better responsiveness for sidewalk compliance.
He added that staff is bringing this information to the Board because this will
have a major impact in terms of staff’s ability to move forward with the
implementation of new routing for the East corridor. There have been
challenges serving areas where there are no sidewalks so RTD has been
working with our partners and municipalities to get the sidewalks built.
Director Deadwyler asked how RTD is supposed to handle this in the future
and noted that the sidewalks in Park Hill were built very narrow and on
stone. She added that while RTD is not the builder of the sidewalks, there is
an entire neighborhood full of small sidewalks and asked what is RTD’s
responsibility in that situation. Bruce Abel explained that the City and
County of Denver is implementing a pedestrian and sidewalk committee to
determine where they want to spend money expanding city sidewalks.
Director Deadwyler further inquired about areas that already exist. She
asked if the municipalities are required to expand the existing sidewalks for
bus stops. Bruce Abel explained that the cities must make the appropriate
modifications.
Director James indicated that this is remarkable and it is great to see the
enhancement of the partnership between jurisdictions like the City and
County of Denver and RTD.

• Hiring Update
Bruce Abel indicated that the hiring update was included in the June 14,
2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. He
acknowledged and appreciates the efforts from the Marketing and HR
departments for continuing to address the need for Operators for both bus
and rail.
Director Archuleta inquired as to how many more operators are needed on
the bus side. Bruce Abel indicated that RTD is only short 50 bus operators.

designed to communicate to transit grantees the Federal expectations
related to ADA. At the end of 2015 a new circular was distributed which
provided additional guidance for accessible bus stops and bus stop shelters.
The practice had been that existing stops and shelters were grandfathered,
even if an existing stop was moved; however, per the circulator, now if an
existing stop is moved it must be treated as a new stop.

6.A

Director Bagley mentioned that the number of individuals entering service is
increasing, which is good news and he thanked staff for their efforts.

 Lost Service Hours Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that prior to the fall of last year we were
missing 10 to 20 hours of service on an average weekday. By late fall, it
was into the hundreds and got as high as 1,000. He said in May this was
down to 88 hours and the trend is continuing in the appropriate direction.

Audit Committee to be included with the 2016 1st Quarter Performance

D. Other Matters
Director James encouraged his fellow Board members to attend the Urban
Exploration trip that he took with the Denver Downtown Partnership. He noted that
he had an opportunity to visit the Fulton Street Mall in Brooklyn which is
remarkably similar to the 16th Street Mall. He added that this trip is an opportunity
to learn city building and to interact with our colleagues in other agencies who
serve the public.
Director Hoy commented that the Transform event sponsored by Smart Commute
Metro North will be on June 29 at Digital Globe. This event will be interesting
because the featured speaker is Rutt Bridges, who wrote a book about driverless
cars. There will also be a speaker from Digital Globe that will demonstrate how

6.B

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial
Analysis, reminded the Board that the 2016 Adopted Budget
was approved in November 2015 and staff made changes in
June to account for more accurate and updated information.
Staff will begin unfolding the 2017 Requested Budget in
August with a request for approval in November. She
reviewed the 2016 Amended Budget available in the June 14,
2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet. Staff will request adoption of the 2016 Amended
Budget at the June 28, 2016 Board Meeting.
The adjustments being requested are:
a.
Revenues be decreased by $46.9 million for a new total
of $1,074.8 million.
b.
Operating expenditures be increased by $11.6 million
for a new total of $647.1 million.
c.
New capital expenditures be increased by $35.1 million
for a new total of $520.0 million.
d.
Interest payments on debt be increased by $0.4 million
for a new total of $117.8 million.

with an Amended Budget that addresses the issues of fare
revenue and sales and use tax being significantly below initial
forecasts.

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

time staff has had to lower expenditures in quite some time.
She reiterated that RTD cannot appropriate revenues but must
project revenues each year. She indicated the Amended
Budget shows revenue projections decreasing by $46.9 million
on a combined basis. Her team was able to make up for this
deficit by working with staff to reduce capital and operating
expenses. She thanked everyone who worked so diligently on
the Amended Budget process.

• Approval of ConvergeOne Phone Switch Contract
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to enter into contract negotiations with ConvergeOne for purchase of
Avaya hardware, licenses, installation, and maintenance of RTD’s phone
system. The estimated cost of the Avaya Phone Switch Upgrade of
$865,000 includes installation costs of $355,750 which was approved
in the 2016 Capital Budget and five (5) years of warranty, maintenance
and support of $509,250 which will be included in future operations and
maintenance budgets.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the June 28, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp introduced Brett Feddersen, Manager of Shared
Technical Services, and asked him to provide a brief overview
of the recommendation. Brett Feddersen explained that this
request is to purchase an upgrade to RTD’s Avaya Phone
Switch. He stated the current equipment is between 10 to 12
years old and support expires during the third quarter of this
year. He indicated the upgraded switch will provide more
modern functionality and increase the number of licenses
available, which is needed with the new rail line openings.
This is also a pre-requisite for the Telephone Information
Center to upgrade their software.
Director Sisk asked what staff knew about ConvergeOne in
terms of stability. He wonders if there is any support from
Avaya during our warranty period if ConvergeOne goes out of
business. He expressed concern that a five year warranty is
not worth much if the company is no longer in business. He
urged staff to look at the strength of the vendor. Brett
Feddersen said he would have to look into if Avaya would

Committee Chair Menten stated that while she voted yes this evening, she
would like to have additional information about how often RTD needs
support to justify those high costs. She would also like Director Sisk’s
question answered. Heather Copp stated staff would provide the Board with
the answers before the Board Meeting.

C. Updates

• SmartCard Project Update
Heather Copp asked Tonya Anderson, SMT Project Administrator, to review
the highlights of the SmartCard Project Update that was included in the June
14, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Tonya Anderson noted that since the Update was prepared, staff has
learned some new information related to the external hosting of the SMT
environment. She said that although the report says the next activity will be
deploying the disaster recovery environment that will not be until the
July/August timeframe. She shared that 50 handheld Smart Media Readers
had been deployed with completion anticipated by the end of July. Tonya
Anderson stated that staff is approximately 50% complete with site surveys
for the first Retail point of Sale test locations at King Soopers. AlbertsonsSafeway’s legal department is reviewing the terms and conditions and staff
anticipates receiving comments next week.
Heather Copp reminded the Board that the plan as of the last Committee
meeting was for the web portal to go live at the end of June; however, last
week staff received a security assessment from Xerox and was not happy
with the results. She said the good news is that from a functional
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Menten expressed that the support cost
seemed like a lot of money when compared with the capital
costs. She wondered if there was something staff felt needed
annual support as opposed for paying for on-demand support.
Brett Feddersen shared that the other bid received was $200K
higher.

6.B

Heather Copp shared that RTD would be hiring a 3rd party assessor to review
the report along with RTD’s Cyber Security Manager. She explained that
staff is very concern that our system is as secure as possible for our
customers because they will be putting their credit card information into the
web portal. She reiterated that staff would not know if the June 30 go-live
date would be possible until receiving the new assessment so she wanted to
apprise the Board of the situation.
Director Hoy pointed out that if Xerox is not providing their report until June
29 it will likely take a third party some time to complete an assessment after
that. He said this review could feasibly take another month or longer.
Heather Copp stated this was why she did not give the Board a new go-live
date. She shared that staff thought they would be given a more detailed
report two weeks ago but were not happy with what was provided.
Director Deadwyler expressed that it was very disappointing that there
continue to be problems with the SmartCard. She wonders if the program
will ever be fully up and running or if RTD should be looking at something
else. She asked how long it took other agencies to implement similar
programs.
Director Lubow inquired as to the lessons learned from this project. She
expressed concern that this report was received at the last minute. Heather
Copp stated everyone has been pushing for this date. She said from a
functional standpoint staff was happy and surprised with the product Xerox
delivered; however, related to security staff had a difference of opinion from
Xerox. She stated Xerox had a delivery date, delivered what they thought
was satisfactory, and staff disagreed. She thinks Xerox is on the same page
now. She explained the reason this just came up is that security must be
tested in the same environment as if it were available to the public which
was not ready until just recently. Heather Copp stated no one was more
disappointed than the team and they would not be letting up.
Director Lubow wondered if perhaps there was a communication lapse or if
this was just an optimistic schedule. Heather Copp stated she did not think
there was but it was something being discussed with Xerox. She said
everyone knew this was an optimistic schedule from the very beginning.
General Manager Genova reiterated that launching the web portal has
always been a very aggressive schedule and said he has been pushing the
team very hard. The team has been working diligently and a lot of hours.Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

standpoint it appears everything is working very well but based on the
security assessment it is not likely staff will meet the go-live date of June
30. She stated Xerox has committed to producing a new report to identify
any remaining issues by June 29, but this will give staff very little time to
mitigate.

6.B

He wishes the Board knew how hard he has been pushing them; however,
he is not going to risk going live with a system that staff is not comfortable
with when it comes to people’s credit cards.

Committee Chair Menten thanked staff for making security a priority as no
one wants to have any incidents involving credit card information.

• First Quarter 2016 Performance Report
Jannette Scarpino reviewed the First Quarter 2016 Performance Report that
was included in the June 14, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet. She noted there were several areas where RTD
or the private carriers did not meet goal, such as safety incidents or level of
customer complaints, but overall both RTD and the contractors are doing
well. She believes some of the lower performing areas will improve as the
operator and mechanic vacancies are improving.
Committee Chair Menten said something notable is the on-time performance
improving for Access-a-Ride. She asked staff to share with those companies
the Board’s appreciation.

• April 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, commented there was still a lot of red on the
dashboard. He said year-to-date sales and use tax was down 4.9%,
ridership was down 5.1% and fare revenue was down 12.5% versus the
budget. He explained when staff presents this next month the numbers
should align better if the 2016 Amended Budget is approved.
Director Bagley thanked staff for being as prudent as they have been in
reference to the sales and use tax and fare revenue. He believes this
demonstrates that the economy is in a lull from the continual up-up-up of
years past. He does not blame the CU Leeds School of business for their
forecasts but it is important that staff reacts. He believes staff has done a
good job reacting. He reiterated that the 2016 Amended Budget
demonstrates that RTD is being prudent from a fiscal sustainability
standpoint.

Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 14, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley asked staff to explain how the payments to Xerox work. He
thinks Xerox needs to understand that there are no further payments until
the web portal works. He said his sense is that Xerox is not as responsive
as they could be. Tonya Anderson explained that payments are made based
on milestones, for example when they delivered design documents and RTD
staff accepted the document.

D. Other Matters
Committee Chair Menten shared that she and Director Lubow thought it might be
good to have a brief presentation on the Eagle P3 project and financing now that
one of the lines is operational. She said this will be at the July Financial

III.

Other Matters
Director Hoy expressed that RTD needs to address the University of Colorado A Line. He
stated it is all anyone wants to talk about. He believes the Agency’s reputation is riding
on the performance of this line. He said he does not know if the answer right now is more
Public Relations or just getting the train to run as it should but something needs to be
done.
General Manager Genova indicated staff has met with several of the different Boards of
the concessionaire team. There is a Board for Denver Transit Partners (DTP), which is the
umbrella of the concessionaire, as well as Denver Transit Systems (DTS) and Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). He said on Monday at the request of DTO he met with their
Board during the APTA Rail Conference and had a very candid conversation about all of
RTD’s concerns. He shared that he also had a call with the DTP Board this morning and
told them the same concerns. He said he told them these issues were unacceptable and

Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 23, 2016 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

6.C

6.C

DTP needs to come up with a plan, not give more excuses. He said the DTP Board will be
coming to Denver the week of July 5 with an action plan to address the remaining issues.
Director Deadwyler said she hoped DTP would be able to roll out their proposed action
plan immediately.

General Manager Genova noted one of the areas of concerns is the condition of the atgrade crossings and the fact that these have yet to be certified by the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) or the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). He explained there is one
outstanding issue, which is the issue of constant warning time and gate downtime.
Currently the gates are staying down much longer on some of the crossings than the
original design time.
Chair Tobiassen asked about the cause of the gates being down longer than designed.
Director Deadwyler pointed out this was an issue she brought up during testing but she
thought it would be rectified by opening. General Manager Genova said it was related to
the wireless technology being used at the crossings. He noted the times had improved,
but they still need to get better.
Director Deadwyler asked what DTP planned to do for those riders that missed their flights
due to issues. General Manager Genova explained that DTP did not plan to get into the
practice of reimbursing customers directly but there was discussion about providing RTD
with some form of compensation to distribute as RTD saw fit. He stressed that this was
not a commitment but a conversation.
Chair Tobiassen has heard from several customers that the airlines were willing to work
with them to make changes for missed flights, such as Southwest. Director Deadwyler
asked what happens when that is not the case. Chair Tobiassen asked staff to look into
the various airlines policies as he suspects they are working with passengers as best as
they can. Director Deadwyler asked General Manager Genova to have this information
prior to having further conversations with DTP about this matter.
Director Hoy believes RTD needs to do a better job related to Public Relations for the
University of Colorado A Line. He noted he often hears the media talk about safety issues
but it is really the opposite. The delays and issues are often being caused by an
overabundance of concern for safety. He also noted the on-time performance statistics
really show a different story than what is being reported. General Manager Genova said

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 23, 2016 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova shred that despite the issues, ridership on the University of
Colorado A Line continues to be steady with the weekday average for week 8 at over
16,900; however, he reiterated that the current performance is unacceptable.

6.C

staff is constantly communicating with the media but cannot control what they decide to
report.

Director Hoy pointed out there were really no at-grade crossings along the B Line. Also,
when the B Line opens there will be no complexities from G Line operations initially. He
said from his point of view operations should be pretty straight forward. He stated if there
are a lot of issues when that line opens there will be reason to question DTP’s ability to
operate the trains. General Manager Genova shared there are two private at-grade
crossings and one gated crossing within the Burlington Northern service yard, but no
public at-grade crossings. General Manager Genova pointed out that there is a section of
single track along the B Line which is something DTP has had issues with along the
University of Colorado A Line; however, he agreed that operating the B Line is simpler with
compared with the University of Colorado A Line.
Director Hoy stated it was disappointing to think that people are avoiding the University of
Colorado A Line due to the on-time performance. He noted ridership numbers are high but
thinks this could be RTD’s best performing line if the perception was that it was reliable.
Chair Tobiassen requested to speak with someone from staff who really understood the
technical details of the University of Colorado A Line operations. Director Francone
agreed. She shared that she recently attended a meeting of 60 engineering type
individuals who were asking her a lot of technical questions. She sees it as part of her job
to take the heat but she would like to be able to provide them with an educated answer.
Director Hoy stated a second component that needed to be addressed around the
University of Colorado A Line is wayfinding. He said from personal experience it is very
difficult to get oriented at the airport and find the train. He indicated it is also difficult to
figure out where to go at Denver Union Station.
General Manager Genova shared that staff has been working with DIA to improve the
signage. An email was forwarded to Kim Day, DIA CEO, that was received by the City of
Denver and outlined a myriad of concerns. He has asked her to assign a specific person
on the DIA staff to work with the commuter rail team. He said he just returned from the
APTA Rail Conference and took pictures along the way of where improvements could be
made. He stated at Denver Union Station new directory maps that show the whole
environment have been added from light rail to the historic building. Additionally, the light
rail tracks that used to be track one and two have been renamed to eleven and twelve to

Director Hoy inquired as to who paid for bus bridges when they were necessary along the
University of Colorado A Line due to service outages. General Manager Genova stated
DTP was responsible for those costs.

eliminate confusion. He noted a lot of the signage at DUS simply says “Light Rail” or
“Commuter Rail” which does not necessarily mean anything to our patrons so line
designations have been added as well.

Director Francone asked if any additional Directors submitted the General Manger
Appraisal Survey. Barbara McManus indicated she did not have official numbers but had
heard from a number of Directors that they had finished it.

Retiree Awards
Chair Tobiassen noted there were three retirees this month with one in attendance.
Rolf Asphaug, Acting General Counsel, recognized Debi Drewes, Legal Assistant, for her
17 years of service. He noted that she worked on the floor below the Board Office and
Board members might have heard her cheery voice on occasion. At times she had to
speak at length with constituents who were unhappy with RTD but every time she won
them over. Debi is also one of the most fascinating people the legal department has ever
known; Debi knows Bruce Springsteen personally, and that is only one small aspect of her
amazing life. She will be missed in the legal department as she has always gone beyond
what she is required to do. On her last day she worked late to help with a PEC matter
because it needed to be done. Debi is and has been an extremely loyal and dedicated
employee.
Debi Drewes shared that she came to RTD as a temp in the legal department and within a
week she felt at home, and within a few months RTD felt like family. RTD has the
greatest group of people, which is quite extraordinary in the business world. Debi thanked
the Board and Staff for the wonderful opportunity she had.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated pubic participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Dan Burke, Centennial, noted that the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado
(NFBCO) has six chapters within RTD’s service area with hundreds of members.
His concern was over the April 19th ADA Safety Day, which was a very frustrating
experience for the 25+ members of the NFBCO who attended the event. He added
that the issue boils down to training for staff. On that particular day individuals
carrying white canes were consistently grabbed. The NFBCO wants to continue to

work with RTD and wants to share the videos of that day as training videos for
staff. The videos will help staff understand how to work with blind individuals
effectively and respectfully.
Emily Kelley, Boulder, was here with several of her fellow riders who commute from
Boulder each day to discuss the elimination of the Dartmouth and Broadway bus
stop. She shared that she has taken the bus from the Dartmouth stop for the past
eight years and it would be inconvenient if that stop is removed. She added that if
the stop is removed she will be forced to drive to one of the Park-n-Rides that
quickly fill up. She stated that as a full time working mom of a one year old she
would appreciate having the convenience of the bus stop so that she does not have
to spend her time commuting.
Michelle Médal, Boulder, indicated that she has been riding the bus from Boulder for
the past six years for her job at CU Denver. She added that she drives across
Boulder every morning in order to park at the Dartmouth Park-n-Ride. She noted
that there are not any other places to park her car on Broadway because the 27th &
Broadway stop was removed and Baseline & Broadway does not have parking. She
stated it would be a burden and potentially dangerous to get to the Table Mesa
Park-n-Ride in morning traffic. She further added that if she was forced to go to
the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride she and her other Dartmouth fellow riders would have
to drive around in circles to find parking, climb four flights of stairs and then cross
a bridge to get to the bus. She stated having the bus stop at Dartmouth takes only
a few seconds and there are usually several people boarding.
Matt Silverman, Boulder, explained that he has been riding the bus from Boulder to
Denver on a daily basis since February of 1976. He indicated that the Flat Iron
Flyer is a big improvement to the bus service but urged the Board to keep the
Dartmouth Park-n-Ride. He added that the vast majority of people who live in
Boulder are north of Dartmouth and this Park-n-Ride is the closest for the majority
of Boulder residents. The other Park-n-Rides at 40th & Broadway and Table Mesa
would require additional driving. He thanked the Board for their time and for their
consideration to keep this convenient and environmentally sensitive Park-n-Ride
open.
David Kreutzer, Boulder, thanked Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, and Director Sisk for their continuing correspondence regarding the
Dartmouth stop. He pointed out that previously there was a sign identifying the
Dartmouth stop as temporary, which he thinks caused confusion and discouraged
ridership from that location. He appreciates RTD removing the temporary sign to
eliminate any confusion. He further added that while the Flatiron Flyer (FF) total
travel time is important, it is not as important as the total travel time for customers.
Nationwide there is a big push for mass transit agencies to solve the last mile
problem. He noted that the old BX route solved the last mile problem by stopping
frequently enough so that people did not have to drive or ride their bikes. By

decreasing the number of stops significantly RTD is creating a last mile problem,
especially since the two local buses, the SKIP and the DASH, either pass a FF stop
significantly or do not run frequently enough. He said once people get in their cars
they may just continue driving to Denver. Other people may ride their bikes which
would lead to more bikes on the buses which would be time negative.
Janet Streater, Boulder, commented that RTD has closed a number of Regional
Park-n-Ride bus stops in South Boulder for the Flatiron Flyer. South Boulder has
working class neighborhoods, and the recently closed stops have been used as
Regional stops by RTD customers for over 30 years. She added that closing these
particular stops is problematic for riders as it creates a 1.2 mile stretch without a
Regional stop or a connecting high frequency bus. She believes this is why the City
of Boulder has submitted a formal request to reinstate these stops. She added that
while the Dartmouth stop has been restored on a temporary basis, she hopes it will
become permanent. She noted that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration facility in Boulder will be expanding its workforce in 2017 and that
site borders the Dartmouth stop.
Alan Streater, Boulder, noted that he has supported efficiency and the bus system
in general for a very long time. He commented that if RTD were to search its
historical records it would find his correspondence complaining about the
Broomfield and Church Ranch Stops. He added that he purchased his home
because of the Dartmouth stop and there are good reasons to keep that stop on the
Flatiron Flyer schedule. He further added that there were other options to achieve
efficiency, such as paying in advance prior to boarding.
Zach Miller, Boulder, commented that he is an environmental lawyer and has been
riding the bus to downtown Denver since 1981. He added that like most of his
neighbors, he purchased his home in the Martin Acres subdivision because at the
time and it was affordable. Now, one of the selling points realtors use is that this
subdivision is very pedestrian friendly because of the nearby RTD stop. He noted it
is disconcerting to the neighborhood as a whole that all of the sudden this bus stop
is going to disappear, subsequently eliminating all of the bus stops between Base
Line Road and Table Mesa. He mentioned if this stop is eliminated riders will have
to go for another half mile before they can get off of the bus. Additionally, the
schedule to Denver is not posted and there have been a few instances where bus
drivers drove past the Dartmouth stop with people waiting. The combination of
these items has discouraged riders from utilizing the Dartmouth stop.
Elizabeth Dickinson, Lafayette, explained that she had already emailed her District
representative but wanted to share her experience of the Route L with the Board.
She noted that for the second time she is leaving the L bus in favor of catching the
Flatiron Flyer in Superior. She said that the L bus takes 2.5 to 3 hours a day to
commute to Denver. The reason for the lengthy commute is the multiple stops and
the prolonged wait of 9 minutes at each stop, even if no riders are getting on or

off. She hopes that the schedule can be tweaked to make the Route L a better
commute.

Director Bagley indicated he wanted an update regarding the 16th Street Mall project. He
asked where RTD stands with the City and County of Denver (Denver) and Downtown
Denver Partnership (DDP) regarding the five weekends in June and July that the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle would be diverted. General Manager Genova reminded the Board that
there are five weekends when the Mall Shuttle will be operated on 15th and 17th Streets.
There are a number of activities that the City and County of Denver, as well as the
Downtown Denver Partnership, will be doing on those weekends to test various types of
activations along the Mall.
Director Bagley noted that he is concerned with what happens with the Mall and the
perceptions other entities have regarding the Mall in the future. General Manager Genova
explained that the plan is to do more fine tuning next year based on what is being done
this summer in order to narrow a few concepts. Any decisions relating to the Mall or Mall
operations will not be made until the end of 2017.
Director Francone shared that Jefferson County, specifically Commissioner Don Rosier, is
interested in pursuing a pilot program similar to that of Boulder County’s in the
Conifer/Evergreen area. She asked staff to begin a dialog with him.
Director Anderson explained that she is concerned Denver will not test how activities are
accepted on weeks that the Mall Shuttle is not moved and added that testing should occur
both ways. General Manager Genova indicated that the plan includes activation when the
Mall Shuttle is not detoured and Denver and DDP staffs are cognizant of Board requests.
Director Folska thinks it is important for the Board to be appraised of the information
Denver receives from their consultant in real-time. She wonders what will happen to
ridership when the Mall Shuttle is diverted but there are no marketing efforts to bring
people in. General Manager Genova explained that staff will undertake a comprehensive
communication on those weekends that the Mall Shuttle is detoured. He stated that
RTD’s partners have also agreed to help distribute that messaging. Staff will be
monitoring ridership very closely and conducting our own surveys to capture information
on the activities as they occur.
Director Folska noted that she would like to see the cost associated with the marketing
efforts from the City and County of Denver and RTD’s costs in relation to the temporary
changes in operations. General Manager Genova indicated that the Mall Shuttle would be
run on a cost neutral basis on the five weekends that it is detoured. The Mall Shuttle will
not have the same type of frequency, but the operation on those days will be cost neutral.

reimbursed for certain expenses relating
to the financing of buses.

Discussion:

Director Francone noted that she does not disagree that
new buses are needed, but it seems that this purchase
was moved up quickly and in combination with the
latest financial reports it gives her pause about
spending the money now.
Director Menten explained that she will vote no for this
action item as she has a concern about RTD’s debt.
She also has a concern that after review of this item,
RTD has a rolling purchase where we buy, take
delivery, put out to bid, etc. She expressed concern
that a former RTD Chair, Lee Kemp, also works for MCI
and is now running for the Board again. She said she
believes everything was done above board but thinks
this item should be tabled until it is determined if he is
still RTD’s sales representative.
Director Lubow indicated that there does not appear to
be any improprieties, but in the interest of full
disclosure, at least this issue is out in the open.

New Business
Director Bagley mentioned that when he, Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of
Planning, and several staff members met with the City of Littleton City Manager and City
Council members to address a number of topics. He further noted his attendance at the
APTA Bus and Paratransit Conference and commented that the Ten Transcendent Trends
Reshaping the Future of Transportation presentation was very compelling. The
presentation explored national trends such as: growing populations, evolving community
foot prints, diversity rules, age shifts, household shifts, sustainability, stagnant wages,
technology and transparency. Director Bagley added that he really enjoyed the presentation
and noted it would be beneficial to have the same presenter, John W. Martin, speak before
a transit oriented group in Denver. The presentation cost is $6000 plus transportation and
lodging, but if that could be shared between different groups it would be extremely
valuable.
Director Walker noted that he was at a recent groundbreaking for a mixed use development
at Elati and Bates. He also noted that the City of Englewood was very grateful for the
change to Route 27 which will take residents from Englewood Station to Broadway
quicker. Director Walker further added that in the last month he participated in the Colfax
marathon, the Denver Day of Rock and the Bolder Boulder. He indicated that our operators
and schedulers did a great job, especially on the Denver Day of Rock. The Mall Ride
operators are keenly aware of everything happening around them and they do a fantastic
job. Director Walker asked if service should be moved, changed or temporarily shifted,
does staff keep statistics on specific routes affected, such as the 12 when the Pearl Street
Farmers Market is going on. General Manager Genova noted that on event driven days,
staff normally does not track numbers.
Directory Bagley commented that the Monday Morning Q has excellent information. This is
something that needs to be recognized by the Board for what staff does and how they can
make changes.

Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

June 8, 2016

Subject:

Extension of Aconex Contract to 2020

General

Board Meeting Date: June 28, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a three-year
contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in the total amount
not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational Management Software as a
Service. Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current Aconex contract will be ending May of 2017; however, RTD will still have many ongoing
construction projects such as Eagle, I-225, SERE, North Metro as well as smaller engineering projects,
that will still be active past that date. These projects will need a document control system to capture
construction and process project closeout documentation. Also, as projects complete, Capital Programs
is required to turn over necessary operational data to Base side departments such as Commuter Rail and
Facilities Maintenance. Because these Base side departments did not have a repository to receive and
store turn over and operational documentation, an Aconex Change Order was issued in 2016 to provide
the Aconex platform to the Base side to satisfy that business requirement. Because of these ongoing
document control needs, RTD would like to extend the Aconex contract to 2020. In addition, Aconex
recognizes the benefit of having RTD as a client and has made an extension offer price that is good until
June 30, 2016. This price is close to our original contract amount and still offers RTD more usability for
the Base side departments.
DISCUSSION
Due to the number of current and future projects, the large amount of data and number of system users,
it is recommended that RTD extend the contract years to obtain a consistent document repository rather
than go out to bid on a different system. This is also the recommendation of the RTD’s Enterprise
Content Management consultant, the iQ Business Group, who is currently working with RTD to improve
our information management practices and will recommend an enterprise content management approach
later this year. Other factors include, with five of the major FasTracks projects opening this year,
Capital Programs would be hard pressed to provide the necessary resources to conduct a procurement
for another system of this type and migrate the data from over thirty-two (32) projects to another
system. Also, because many of the projects, including the new University of Colorado A-Line Commuter
Rail, have the use of Aconex set in to their contracts and/or agreements, RTD would have to work with
contractor teams on conversion to another system and provide training. By staying with the Aconex
system RTD will be able to:
 Maintain system and process continuity to its project teams and stakeholders
 Provide a system to receive track performance reports and invoice processing for the Commuter
Rail division

Packet Pg. 57

11.A

 Provide the Facilities Maintenance department a repository with which they are already familiar in
order to turn over closeout data for the FasTracks projects to Facilities Maintenance
 Avoid any contractual disputes with stakeholders
 Avoid migration costs and training
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total amount of the contract extension is $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each
not to exceed the total amount of $1,196,400 Funding for this contract was included in the 2015
Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.
SBE PARTICIPATION
The RTD Small Business Opportunity Office established a 0% SBE participation goal for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to award
a three-year contract in the amount of $695,400, with three one-year options at $167,000 each in
the total amount not too exceed $1,196,400 to Aconex for Construction and Operational
Management Software as a Service. Funding for this contract was included in the 2015 Annual
Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use RTD in-house staff and consultants to
develop a solution using RTD’s Legacy document control software and re-train users. This is not
recommended because the Legacy system does not have the necessary functionality to provide the
level of service needed to support RTD projects and departments both inside and outside our firewall.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the contract and go back out to look for a
new system. This, also, is not recommended, because of the impact to the FasTracks and
Operations Departments and the level of effort it would require to conduct another Request For
Proposal (RFP). This is not recommended because Aconex presented the proposal that best meets
the evaluation criteria set forward in the RFP.

ConvergeOne

Phone

Switch

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with ConvergeOne
for purchase of Avaya hardware, licenses, installation, and maintenance of RTD’s phone system. The
estimated cost of the Avaya Phone Switch Upgrade of $865,000 includes installation costs of
$355,750 which was approved in the 2016 Capital Budget and five (5) years of warranty,
maintenance and support of $509,250 which will be included in future operations and maintenance
budgets.
BACKGROUND
The Shared Technical Services Team within RTD’s Information Technology department is seeking
Board of Directors approval for the purchase of an upgrade to RTD’s Avaya Phone Switch. A phone
switch provides capabilities that channel incoming and outgoing calls and data and directs it toward
its intended destination. RTD’s current phone switch provides limited call screening and recording
capabilities. This functionality needs to be upgraded to accommodate planned service improvements
within RTD’s Customer Care Division. Moreover, by keeping RTD’s equipment current and supported,
we reduce the risk of loss of communication within RTD and with its customers while improving
needed security capabilities for RTD security staff.
With our current hardware and support offerings, RTD is facing a number of risks:
 The current equipment being utilized is a minimum of ten years old with some equipment
having been installed in 2004.
 External vendor support contract is expiring in Q3 2016.
The purpose of this project is to implement an upgraded phone switch, install modern components,
upgrade the software, and provide installation and maintenance support to RTD. This will yield the
following additional benefits:
 This implementation will allow for the recording of the Internet Protocol (IP) phones
throughout the District, with a specific benefit to the RTD security team RTD’s planned new
Telephone Information Center’s (TIC) software solution is dependent upon the phone switch
being upgraded to allow gathering of call center operational metrics including:
o Average wait times
o Queue management
o Call interrupt
o Listening capabilities
o Workforce management
 Increasing the number of licenses to help accommodate the growth of rail lines and facilities
within the District.

Packet Pg. 59

12.B

 Allows for voicemail/e-mail integration where individuals can screen their voice message
through their computer and/or mobile device.
DISCUSSION
The current district wide phone switch was upgraded from a Siemen’s system to an Avaya system in
2004. This equipment has reached the end of its useful life under the current configuration.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal and has identified an Avaya Platinum Partner in telecommunications equipment. This
proposed partnership will allow RTD the flexibility for any future expansion of services and/or
features that may arise due to rapidly changing communications platforms. As part of the Request
for Proposal, Information Technology included a request for pricing for five (5) years of maintenance
and warranty services payable annually.
The requested funds include the hardware, software and licenses necessary to upgrade the Avaya
Telecommunications switch, as well as installation, integration and training of RTD staff. The new
telecommunications phone switches will be installed within RTD Telecomm closets throughout the
District.
An RFP has been issued and a selection committee has evaluated and identified the best candidate,
ConvergeOne, to meet RTD’s needs.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of the Avaya Phone Switch Upgrade including installation, warranty, and
maintenance and support is $865,000 which includes $355,750 for capital costs for installation and
$509,250 for ongoing support. The capital costs are included in the 2016 Capital Budget and the
remaining costs will be budgeted in future years in operating expenses
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the contract with ConvergeOne. This is the recommended action to ensure that
RTD’s phone switch is replaced to meet current and future needs.
 Do not approve the contract with ConvergeOne. This is not the recommended action because
the current phone switch has aging equipment and will no longer be supported after Q3 2016.

Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $0.051 million to $1,500.674 million as detailed
below in the overview of the 2016 Amended Budget, and to decrease the appropriation of Capital
Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $243.961 million to $843.221 million.

13.C

DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2016 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2016 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2016
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2016 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $11.6 million from the 2016 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $1.2 million on the
Base System, $10.4 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $0 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, Free MetroRide and I-225). Of the total increase for the Base
System, major elements are $2.1 million for one-time expense projects in Capital Programs (13th Avenue
crossing replacement, Bike Shelters pass-through, Wagon Road PnR improvements) and $0.4 million for
ongoing street improvements to support the runboard, $0.4 million for the labor practices settlement for
mandated overtime in Bus Operations, $1.5 million for a write-off of parts inventory sold at auction, and
$0.3 million for additional track maintenance costs and $0.3 million for rail overtime in Rail Operations.
These amounts are offset by reductions of $2.0 million for traction power in Rail Operations, $0.7
million in service costs in Access-a-Ride, and various other costs. For FasTracks, the $10.4 million
increase consists primarily of $2.5 million in utility relocation and bridge/sewer work on DUS track and
$6.9 million in third-party betterments in Aurora (funded by third party contributions). On the Base
System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 0.5%.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses
(excluding previously approved transfers) are summarized by department below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $0.4 million for the labor dispute settlement related to mandated overtime
Access-a-Ride
 Net decrease of $0.7 million in ADA service costs
Rail Operations
 Net decrease of $1.2 million from a reduction in traction power on the West Line, offset by increases
in operator and non-operator overtime, additional track maintenance costs and software upgrades for
the LRT training simulator
Capital Programs
 Net increase of $37.9 million from Wagon Road PnR improvements, grant-funded work to replace the
13th Avenue Crossing, grant-funded bike-shelters, annual street improvements inadvertently omitted
from the Adopted Budget to support the runboard, and Facilities functions moved to Capital
Programs ($35.6 million)
Safety, Security and Asset Management
 Net decrease of $35.6 million from Facilities functions moved to Capital Programs

Packet Pg. 65

13.C

Finance and Administration
 Net decrease of $0.5 million from decreases in various IT project costs, training, and office rent
offset by increased funds received for Wellness Department recognition
Planning
 Net decrease of $55,000 for reduction in Art-n-Transit and Bicycle Program expense
Communications
 Net decrease of $48,000 for decrease in SmartCard promotional material costs offset by
reimbursement of other funds used for Grand Opening costs
Executive Office
 Net increase of $1.5 million for write-off of inventory to be sold at auction
Non-Departmental
 Net decrease of $0.2 million for expense pass-through grants to capital
FasTracks Project/Construction
Capital Programs
 Net increase of $9.6 million for utility relocation and bridge/sewer work on BNSF DUS track
derailment, outside reproduction and forms, and storm drainage, water line and fiber work funded by
the City of Aurora (third-party betterments)
FasTracks Operations
There were no increases to operating expense for FasTracks Operations.
Debt Service
On the Base System, interest expense is expected to increase by $0.4 million from a proposed new COP
issuance of $50.0 million for bus fleet purchases in 2016 (to include MCI Intercity buses, new
articulated buses, and transit buses scheduled in the 2018 fleet plan) but there is no change to principal
payments on debt. Capitalized interest as well is expected to show no change. Interest expense and
principal payments on FasTracks also will remain unchanged. A bond issuance of $200 million which
will generate over $228 million of proceeds for construction of SERE and the remaining rail projects
under construction (Eagle, I-225, North Metro) is proposed for the second half of 2016.
2016 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $35.1 million over
the 2016 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the
2016 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of a decrease to Base of $1.8 million. Major adjustments to new capital
funding since the 2016 Adopted Budget include projected reductions in spending for the remainder of
2016 of $1.0 million for the Lafayette PnR reconstruction, $1.0 for expansion of the Treasury Building,
$0.9 million in handheld Smart reader/mobile station devices, $0.2 million in CCTV retrofit on buses,
$4.1 million for articulated buses offset by a transfer of same amount from intercity coaches, with

Packet Pg. 66

13.C

increases of $0.1 million for Civic Center Station rebuild, $0.5 million for mall bus charging units, and
$0.7 million for SMT stored value card implementation. Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of an increase of $36.9 million. This results from updated
project schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2016, adjustments for
grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget. Major additions to
new capital funding since the 2016 Adopted Budget include $0.8 million in higher cost estimates for the
purchase of two new light rail vehicles for I-225, and $38.4 million for the North Metro Corridor which
brings the amount up to the Board-approved Annual Program Evaluation (APE). These amounts are
offset by reductions totaling $2.3 million to FasTracks admin projects and I-225 third-party betterment
work. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2016 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/15 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2016 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/15
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2015.
Previously approved capital carryforward of $843.2 million is decreased by $243.9 million from the
2016 Adopted Budget to reflect fourth quarter 2015 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain
capital projects as expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project
scope changes. The Base System portion is a decrease of $59.3 million and the FasTracks decrease is
$184.7 million. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $46.9 million on a combined basis from the
2016 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $20.7 million from the 2016 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March forecast. The 2016 Amended Budget incorporates
the Below-Trend forecast of 5.2% over 2015 actual. The 2016 Adopted Budget used the CULeeds September Baseline forecast which called for an 8% increase over the then projected 2015
level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, and CMAQ grants are projected to essentially remain flat from
amounts in the 2016 Adopted Budget. This reflects an increase of $2.4 million on the Base
System in capital maintenance, fixed guideway, FASTER, and carryforward grants from the 2016
Adopted Budget, offset by decreases in CMAQ, FTA Ladders of Opportunity, and certain local
grants. FasTracks allocated grants are expected to decrease $2.5 million due to a decrease in the
amount of Small Starts grant funding for the SERE project expected to be received in 2016 offset
by increases in CMAQ funds for the Eagle project.
Fare revenue is reduced by $27.9 million on a combined basis from the 2016 Adopted Budget to
reflect: 1) an 8% fare revenue increase from the 10% fare rate hike offset by retention of
transfers, and 2) a 1.5% ridership increase from FasTracks expansion offset by the effect of the
fare rate increase. Of projected fare revenue of $130.2 million, $117.5 million is attributed to
the Base system and $12.7 million is attributed to FasTracks.

Packet Pg. 67

13.C



Other operating revenue will be reduced by $0.6 million due mainly to a reduction in the 2016
advertising contract. Other non-operating income at $11.8 million is projected to be slightly
higher by $0.2 million due to higher DUS rental income and naming rights offsetting the reduction
in the advertising contract.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $2.4 million from the Adopted Budget
to $13.4 million reflecting amended budget expenditure increases combined with decreases in revenue.
FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a
balance of $15.9 million, same as the 2016 Adopted Budget. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
is used to fund any changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption
of the annual budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor
changes to the FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from
the FasTracks Future Construction Reserve. This reserve was reduced from $30 million in 2015 to
reflect a drawdown of $14.1 million for North Metro construction.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve at $81.3 million is split between the Construction Reserve at $56.3
million and a Start-up Operations Reserve at $25 million. The Start-up Operations Reserve was
established in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation for the years 2015-2016 in order to meet the
1.2x debt service coverage if needed. These balances reflect draws totaling $18.7 million for FasTracks
continuing construction.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2016 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2016 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal

13.C

approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2016 Amended Budget. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement
Fund on the Base System will continue at $3.0 million to each fund in 2016.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2016 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2016 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2016 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2016 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.
