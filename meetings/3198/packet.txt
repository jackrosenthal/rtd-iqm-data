§ 2004

- DRCOG reviewed and approved plan/financing/capital costs pursuant to SB 208 requirements
- RTD initiated design and environmental clearances for corridors

§ 2006

- Responding to safety concerns, freight railroads mandated Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) compliant passenger rail vehicles operate in their rights-of-way (ROW)

• Led to change in technology for Gold Line from LRT to CRT

§ 2007

- Life cycle cost analysis of commuter rail technologies:
• Electric Multiple Units (EMU) technology added significant up-front capital costs compared to Diesel
Multiple Units (DMU) technology

• EMU for East, North Metro and Gold Line

- Lower projected operating and life cycle costs

• DMU for Northwest

2007-2008

§ 2007

- Commodities prices jumped, significantly increasing program costs by $1.2 billion
- Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) FasTracks Task Force established to provide better
understanding of construction issues and financial challenges

• One mayor from each unfunded corridor met regularly allowing MMC to provide RTD
with input into options for path forward

• Direct and informal access to technical and financial information

§ 2008

- Great Recession: sales tax receipts plummeted
- FRA required all passenger railroads install Positive Train Control (PTC) systems,
adding additional capital costs
- RTD concluded that FasTracks could not be completed without significant funds
infusion and/or extending schedule

2014 NAMS – Findings Related to Northwest Rail

§ Construct rail in segments: Feasible, but would require significant
passing tracks to allow for end-of-line freight train storage
§ Alternate routing findings:
- North Metro Corridor to Boulder via UP Boulder Branch

• Significantly lower ridership - bypasses many Northwest communities,
parts of Westminster, Broomfield and Louisville

- North Metro Corridor to Longmont via new ROW
• Significantly lower ridership - bypasses communities noted above and
Boulder. Additionally, new ROW would have to be established in
rapidly growing area

§ BRT network could provide considerable mobility benefits at lower
price than rail

2016 New Starts / Small Starts Analyses

§ Staff analyzed unfinished corridors for potential FTA grant funding
§ FTA rates projects on 5-point scale, from Low to High
§ A project must have at least Medium rating for project justification
and local financial commitment to qualify
§ Based on current FTA criteria:

- Central Corridor Extension: only corridor to potentially meet project

justification criteria with Medium rating
- North Metro Completion and Northwest Rail: Low ratings for project
justification
- Southwest Extension: Medium-Low project justification rating
- All Corridors: Low rating for local financial commitment due to FasTracks
budget constraints

Definition
Annual effort started by RTD in 2007 to re-evaluate and adjust all
FasTracks project cost estimates and financial forecasts to current
market conditions.
RTD nomenclature for the bus and rail services that were existing and
committed prior to FasTracks, generally supported by the then-existing
0.6% sales and use tax.
A bus transit mode that combines key operating qualities of rail transit
with the flexibility of buses. It can operate on bus-only lanes, HOV lanes,
expressways, or ordinary streets. Vehicles are typically designed to allow
rapid passenger loading and unloading, often at multiple doors.
The state of Colorado’s department of transportation.

Abbreviation or Term
APE (Annual Program Evaluation)

Commuter rail is a passenger train that can be operated by diesel fuel,
overhead electrical wires or a combination of the two. This transit mode
is used for local or regional service, typically of longer distances.
Commuter rail vehicles have a heavier frame and larger body than light
rail vehicles, and usually operate in an existing rail corridor.
Diesel powered commuter rail trains.
Association of county and municipal governments in the Denver metro
area working together to address regional issues. DRCOG serves as the
designated metropolitan planning organization for the Denver area and
oversees the planning process for federal transportation funds.
Electric powered commuter rail trains that operate in pairs.
The commuter rail project constructed through a Public-Private
partnership that delivered and operates the RTD’s University of Colorado
A-Line, the G Line and the B Line.
RTD’s name for a comprehensive study and documentation evaluating
the social, environmental and economic impacts of a major capital
project and identifying mitigation measures to be implemented. Used
when there are no federal dollars associated with a project, to assure a
level of analysis like that which would be performed under a federal
National Environmental Policy Act action.
A federal agency (part of the U.S. Department of Transportation) that
oversees certain aspects of rail services, especially safety and
administers certain related funding programs.
A federal agency (part of the U.S. Department of Transportation) that
provides financial, safety and technical oversight and assistance to local
public transportation systems. FTA is the primary federal oversight and
funding administration for RTD.
Adopted by the RTD Board of Directors in 2012, the FISA is a savings
account comprised of eight revenue-generating and cost-saving items
designated to provide funding to build unfinished FasTracks corridors.
Passenger rail cars singly or in short trains on fixed rails in right-of-way
that is often separated from other traffic for part or much of the way.
Light rail vehicles are typically driven electrically with power being drawn
from an overhead electric line.

The Regional Transportation District

The Metro Mayors Caucus is a voluntary and collaborative regional
association of mayors representing 38 cities and towns from across the
Denver metropolitan region. MMC provides a forum for regional
dialogue from which consensus solutions might emerge.
National environmental law enacted in 1969. Established requirements
for identifying environmental impacts and mitigation measures for
projects which either receive federal funding or when a federal agency is
a key participant in the project’s development. Increasing levels of
complexity and analysis include: CatEx (Categorical Exclusion), EA
(Environmental Assessment) and EIS (Environmental Impact Statement).
In 2013, RTD initiated NAMS. The purpose of the study was to develop
consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) and the Northwest area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions
and businesses, on cost effective and efficient mobility improvements to
serve the Northwest area. A NAMS Final Consensus Statement was
accepted by the RTD Board in 2014.
Term referring to the comprehensive operating and maintenance
requirements for a project or system.
Penta-P was authorized by FTA in 2007 to explore the advantages and
disadvantages of public private partnerships for new fixed guideway
projects. One objective was to reduce time and costs associated with the
New Starts program. The RTD Eagle project was one of three projects
selected as a Penta-P pilot project.
Communication/processor-based train control technology designed to
prevent train-to-train collisions, over speed derailments, incursions into
established work zone limits, and the movement of a train through a
main line switch in the improper position.
An easement, a privilege to pass over the land of another.
SB 90-208 states that the RTD Board shall take no action relating to the
construction of a regional fixed guideway mass transit system until such
system has been approved by the designated Metropolitan Planning
Organization (DRCOG), including method of financing and the technology
selected.
Article X, Section 20, of the Colorado Constitution, which limits
governmental revenues and spending. Key provisions: limits year-to-year
spending increases to specified growth rates, with provisions for voters
to remove the limits; requires voter approval for all new taxes or rate
increases for existing taxes; requires voter approval for all issuance of
new debt; requires establishment of a contingency reserve equal to 3%
of annual spending.
YOE describes the cost of an expenditure in the year it will be realized,
rather than the year it is estimated. YOE typically includes inflation
factors to incorporate the higher cost of project construction and project
operations in a future year.
