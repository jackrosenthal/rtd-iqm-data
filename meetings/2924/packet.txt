RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Bill Van Meter and Derrick Black to a term
expiring 12/31/2021 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts.
Bill Van Meter and Derrick Black current terms expire on 12/31/2019. Both Bill and Derrick meet the
criteria from Resolution No. 2017, Series 2010 for reappointment.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Bill Van Meter and Derrick

11.A

Black to a term expiring 12/31/2021 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

Subject:

Adoption of the Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached Investment Policy which contains recommended changes to reflect changes in state
law relating to bank securities and some wording changes for clarification purposes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2018. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. Recommended changes are in response to a change in state
law in 2019 and clarification to some previously existing text in the policy.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification requirements.
A redlined copy of the recommended policy is attached which highlights the recommended changes from
the currently adopted investment policy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Board of Directors

Date: October 24, 2019

From:

Barbara G McManus,
Board Office

Date:

October 24, 2019

Subject:

Board Expense Reduction Resolution

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee of the RTD Board of Directors that the Board approve a
motion to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2019, concerning a Temporary Reduction
of Certain Board Office Budget Lines Related to Director Travel and the Allocation of Certain Meeting
Expenses to Directors’ Local Expense Budgets.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial
Management.
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Out-of-District registration
fees for the first two sanctioned events for each Director are not charged against the Director’s
expenses and are instead paid for using Board Office funds.
In 2009 and again in 2011, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions reducing the Board members’
spending limits on their local and travel expenses as economic downturns required a reduction in overall
agency spending.
DISCUSSION
The attached resolution, for Fiscal Year 2020 only:




Reduces by $2,000 the amount allocated to each Directors’ travel expense budget;
Reduces by half, or $12,750, the amount budgeted by the Board Office to defray the cost of
Directors’ registration fees incurred in order to attend out-of-District transit-related conferences;
and
Authorizes the Board Office to allocate a debit in the amount of $10.00 toward each Director’s
local expense account for expenses incurred by the Board Office on behalf of the Director in the
course of preparing for official meetings of the Board and its committees.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution.
2. To reject the resolution. Rejection of this resolution would necessitate further cuts to certain line
items in the Board Office budget in order to balance the Board Office’s component of the 2020
requested agency budget.

Packet Pg. 54

11.C

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of this resolution would result in an estimated General Fund savings of at least $51,000 during
Fiscal Year 2020.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Vince Buzek, Director, District J

Date:

November 6, 2019

Subject:

Promotional Fare Pilot Program (“PFPP”) for
North Metro Line

Date: November 6, 2019

Board Meeting Date: November 19, 2019

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Buzek, Cook, Guissinger, Lubow, Rivera-Malpiede, Whitmore, Williams,
and Chair Tisdale at the Operations/Customer Services Committee meeting, that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager take all necessary steps to design and implement a Promotional
Fare Pilot Program (“PFPP”) and to deploy the first project in the program on the North Metro Line
commencing from its opening date and continuing for a period of six (6) months thereafter.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
RTD has and is exploring means to increase ridership. In fact, increasing ridership is a 2020 Core Goal of
the General Manager. To that end, staff, Directors and others have been exploring the impact of a fare
reduction or flattening fares on ridership demand. This price elasticity of demand analysis is critical to
the RTD Mission. To advance this analysis, and in keeping with the goals of Reimagining RTD, this
proposal will create a pilot program on the soon-to-be-opened North Metro Line. This 6 month pilot
program will cause the fare for the entirety of the North Metro Line to be a Local fare notwithstanding
the fact that the two end of line stations are considered to be in a Regional fare zone. Depending on
outcome of the PFPP, this model may be used as a template to explore fare changes on similarly-situated
routes.
DISCUSSION
In its continuing effort to increase system ridership while simultaneously providing affordable
transportation services and maintaining fiscal sustainability, the Regional Transportation District shall
timely design and implement a Promotional Fare Pilot Program (“PFPP”).
Traveling through three Fare Zones on a corridor results in the rider having to pay a higher regional fare
rather than the lower local fare paid by riders traveling through less than three fare zones. The PFPP is
intended to explore, in a responsible way, what the impact would be of reducing these higher fares to
the same as that paid by local fare zone travelers. The assumption is that payment of the higher fare
may reasonably have the effect of reducing ridership, with the corollary assumption being that lowering
the rate should increase ridership.

Packet Pg. 58

12.D

The goals of the PFPP shall be:
o

o

To increase ridership by a designated factor, such factor to be determined in the development
of each pilot project, over RTD’s reasonable ridership estimates or actual statistics for any
corridor designated for the PFPP;
To test what percentage of lost fare revenue is recovered by an increase in ridership, and
evaluate effects on parking demand;

o

To gather data so as to inform the Re-Imagine study and/or subsequent reviews or
examinations of fare or zone changes

o

Over time, to better ascertain the relationship between fares, ridership, fare revenues, and
farebox recovery in the District
The PFPP would take advantage of the Promotional Fare exemption provision of applicable
federal law. An RTD rail or bus corridor operating under the PFPP shall charge a local fare
only during the period of its designation under the PFPP, unless the parameters of the PFPP
for a specific corridor demand otherwise.

o

All rail and bus corridors that traverse three fare zones, necessitating the payment of a regional fare,
may be eligible for inclusion in the PFPP, with the proviso that only one such corridor shall operate under
the PFPP at any given time, subject at all times to any applicable oversight or restrictions imposed by
regulatory agencies, including the Federal Transit Administration. For a variety of reasons, the North
Metro Commuter Rail Line (“N Line”) is a candidate for this pilot. These reasons include the N line’s
newness, the intense local interest in this subject on the N line, and because it will have available
technology to provide accurate ridership counts. Inclusion as a PFPP will mean that the N Line shall
charge riders a local fare only, starting from the opening date of the N Line until the date six months
following such opening.
At the conclusion of such six-month pilot period the agency shall examine ridership statistics, fare
revenue and parking demand to determine whether the N Line pilot enjoyed ridership growth meeting or
exceeding the designated factor (on an annualized basis) over the agency’s good faith reasonable
estimates or actual ridership statistics on the corridor. In the event that ridership did increase by at least
the designated factor for that corridor, the agency shall look at options for extending this fare and
expanding it to other areas.
STAFF DISCUSSION
BACKGROUND
Prior to the opening of the University of Colorado A Line, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a
consolidated fare structure that resulted in three fare categories: Local, Regional, and Airport. The new
fare structure was the outcome of a two-year process that included extensive public outreach and
engagement, exhaustive technical analysis (including a mandatory FTA Civil Rights Act Title VI fare
equity analysis), and thorough deliberation by the RTD Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 59

12.D

The new fares were designed to simplify the way passengers pay for trips across RTD’s system and
were implemented on January 1, 2016. The rail fare zone categories are Zones A and B (Local), Zone C
(Regional) and the Airport Zone (Denver International Airport). Passengers traveling 1 or 2 zones pay the
Local fare and passengers traveling through 3 zones pay the Regional fare. Airport passengers pay the
Airport fare.
Charging a higher fare for longer distance, faster services is consistent with RTD’s past practice and fare
policies District-wide and was specifically retained as part of the 2016 Fare Policy due to concerns
regarding equity for those making shorter trips. Members of the public commenting on the proposed fare
changes at that time, as well as many elected officials, thought that traveling longer distances on rail
and premium buses warranted a higher fare. The option for traveling at a lower, Local fare, for these
longer distance trips remains for most passengers using the local/limited bus system.
Since 2016, bus fares for Regional and Express buses are based, consistently, on the rail zones. Routes
like the Flatiron Flyer, 120X, 122X and other routes serving Downtown Denver have their fares to and
from Downtown Denver based on the fare zones. Routes not serving Downtown Denver or having long
distances in Zone C have their fares based on the distances used in in determining a Local or Regional
fare for rail: 9.5 miles. Passenger trips traveling greater than 9.5 miles on an express or limited-stop
portion (generally freeway or expressway) require a Regional fare, while passenger trips less than 9.5
miles require a Local fare. These fares are accurately reflected in fare charts on the website and on the
schedules for each Regional route, as well as in the Trailblazer.
The boundary between Zones B and C, and thus a Local and Regional fare to Downtown Denver, is 9.5
miles from Union Station as noted above. The distances in RTD’s fare zones are concentric circles
centered on Union Station that do not take into account the length of the rail lines. RTD felt this was
important in order to assure that RTD passengers were treated as fairly and consistently as possible,
regardless of the difference between how far the station is from Union Station “as the crow flies,”
compared with the somewhat longer distance actually traversed by a Commuter or Light Rail Train (and
the Flatiron Flyer BRT). For example, while the Wheat Ridge-Ward Station on the G Line is 11 miles by
rail from Union Station, the rail line travels north for about 3.5 miles before turning southwest to reach
the end of the line and the straight-line distance is only 7.5 miles.
The Promotional Fare Pilot Project (PFPP) is proposed to respond to requests to expand the existing Rail
System Zone B (“Zone B”) to include two additional N Line stations: Northglenn-112th and Eastlake124th. The stations in question are 10.5 and 11.9 straight-line miles from Union Station, respectively.
Thornton Crossroads-104th is just inside the boundary at 9.4 miles.
The District has received similar requests since 2016 to expand the Local fare zone, including for
example the Jefferson County Government Center Station on the W Line. The narrative in the Discussion
section of this report highlights opportunities and issues associated with the N Line itself, as well as a
broader expansion to stations that would be included if the concept was expanded consistent with
RTD’s distance-based fare policy. To date, our message in response to Local fare zone expansion
requests has been consistent: we are unable to make exceptions to our fare zones for individual stations
or lines. Moving the fare zone boundary in a way that would make the entirety of the N Line a local fare

Packet Pg. 60

12.D

to Union Station would logically necessitate the inclusion of numerous additional stations on other Light
Rail and Commuter Rail lines in Zone B, two stations on the Flatiron Flyer, and the Wagon Road bus park
and ride.
The current PFPP proposal is to limit the expansion of the Local fare zone to only two N Line stations, as
noted above, for a limited period of time. There is a provision in the Federal Transit Administration’s
regulations regarding compliance with provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to do so, for
up to a six-month period, as discussed below. Based upon previous dialogues and experience around this
topic, it is highly likely that other stakeholder jurisdictions will expect similar treatment, so we have
outlined some potential implications for Board consideration.
Also note that staff is preparing to undertake, in 2020, an analysis of various fare structure changes,
including an analysis of flat fares, with estimates of fare revenue changes and anticipated ridership
response. This work is to be modeled using the tools developed in support of the recent fare analyses
and with assistance from four nines technologies, the firm that assisted in analysis for the past studies.
DISCUSSION
As noted, the PFPP is proposed to respond to requests to expand the existing Rail System Zone B
(“Zone B”) to include two additional N Line stations: Northglenn-112th and Eastlake-124th. The PFPP can
afford RTD the opportunity to conduct a before and after analysis of impacts to fare revenue, ridership
and parking demand in isolation to help provide better information for future fare analyses and policy
decision-making. The following sections discuss a number of technical and policy considerations
regarding the PFPP implementation.
Parking Impacts: On the N Line, the station at Thornton Crossroads-104th has the largest parking
capacity at 880 cars. This station is also the last station within Zone B and a local fare to Downtown
Denver under RTD’s current Board-adopted fare structure. The two stations farther north at Northglenn112th and Eastlake-124th have a combined capacity of 720 cars (310 and 410, respectively) and, absent
the PFPP, passengers opting to drive farther to the greater capacity at Thornton Crossroads-104th will
have the advantage of more plentiful parking and a lower fare. Charging a local fare at all stations could
overburden the smaller parking facilities farther north on the N Line, making for a more difficult parking
situation.
Having additional stations with a Local fare to Downtown would also place additional parking demand on
several stations that currently experience full occupancy on a regular basis. The current Local and
Regional fare boundary helps to balance parking demand by encouraging some customers to drive to
parking facilities with available space in exchange for a lower fare to Downtown Denver.
Title VI Implications: RTD strives to operate a socially equitable transit system, where services,
resources, benefits, and adverse effects are shared in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner. As a
recipient of federal financial assistance, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires that RTD
promote social equity in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order
12898 (Environmental Justice). Specifically, the FTA requires that all fare changes are subject to equity
analyses and public feedback. Equity analyses are an evaluation of permanent fare changes for

Packet Pg. 61

12.D

disproportionate impacts on low-income and minority populations. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and Executive Order 12898 (Environmental Justice) prohibit recipients of federal funds from
implementing policies that have the effect of disproportionately impacting low-income and minority
populations.
Over the past four years, RTD has conducted two fare studies to develop fare policies that equitably
meet our fare revenue targets. Any proposal to revise our distance-based fare structure will require a
detailed analysis of revenue and equity impacts. RTD has not subjected the creation of a fare zone
exception for the N Line to an equity analysis or public feedback. Deviating from our current fare zone
policy without conducting an equity analysis or soliciting public feedback violates federal requirements,
jeopardizing current and future federal funding. Further, should the policy change result in
disproportionate impacts, RTD would be exposed to lawsuits under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964.
FTA regulations do allow a very small set of exceptions to their fare equity analysis requirements, one in
particular referred to as a “promotional fare reduction.” If a promotional or temporary fare reduction lasts
six months or longer, then FTA considers the fare reduction permanent and the transit provider must
conduct a fare equity analysis. After the proposed promotional fare period on the N Line ends, RTD
would need to revert from a Local fare back to a Regional fare and then conduct a fare equity analysis to
determine the implications of the Local fare. In any case, RTD could not start another promotional fare
period without conducting a complete District-wide fare equity analysis.
Before and After Analysis: As noted above, a six-month PFPP implementation of Local fares on the N
Line would afford RTD and our stakeholders with a real-world demonstration of the impacts of distancebased fares on fare revenues, ridership and parking demand. RTD will be able to collect information on
each of these both before (during the six-month PFPP period) and then after the conclusion of the PFPP.
This information can be used in future analyses and will provide technical and policy insights that can
inform future decision-making.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Staff has estimated that the six-month promotional fare would result in a fare loss of approximately
$180,000 – based on the relative inelasticity of demand for transit relative to fare changes, and the
revenue differences between the average Local fare compared to the average Regional fare. RTD staff
has not estimated the revenue loss for other individual corridors.
Also note that implementation of fare changes will require staff resources and money, an estimate of
which staff has not had the time to prepare and which would vary based on Board Direction relative to
the scope of the preferred PFPP implementation. These could include but are not limited to: costs to
conduct the before and after analysis; costs to reprogram Ticket Vending Machines; needs associated
with adjusting back-office accounting and customer facing interfaces; resources required for
communications and customer information efforts, printing and advertising, etc.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

November 6, 2019

Subject:

Adoption of the 2020 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 6, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopts
the attached 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance measures for
mission statement goals 1-7. In 2020, there are 42 proposed performance measures to be tracked for
the GM, which is one higher than for 2019.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they should integrate with the Board’s priorities for the coming
year.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2020 are brought
to the Board of Directors for review at this time because the measures are used in development of the
2020 Budget. These final 2020 performance measures are being presented to the Board at the
November 12th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward to the
Board for adoption on November 19th.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the performance measures from 2019 to 2020 are listed below:


Goal 1.4 Reduce the number of light rail accidents
o It is recommended that the measure be changed from reporting preventable light rail
accidents per 100,000 train miles to reporting the actual number of preventable accidents
regardless of miles and that the measure be changed from ≤ 2.0 to ≤ 3.0 in 2020.



Goal 1.5 Reduce the number of commuter rail accidents
o It is recommended that the measure be changed from reporting preventable commuter rail
accidents per 100,000 train miles to reporting the actual number of preventable accidents
regardless of miles and that the measure be changed from ≤ 2.0 to ≤ 3.0 in 2020.



Goal 6.2 Increase in ridership
o It is recommended that the ridership increase for 2020 be established at 2.1% based on
estimates for ridership for 2019 and 2020. Overall system ridership is projected to be flat

Packet Pg. 67

12.E

for the Base System with any ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. Full-year G Line
and SERE numbers are factored in as well as mid-year opening of the N line. The measure
includes all passenger boardings not limited to revenue ridership; ridership estimates for
the Mall Shuttle and Free MetroRide are included.


Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2020 be established at 2.6%. This is
the percentage increase in estimated fare revenue over the 2019 projection. It is based on
ridership estimates and assumes full-year ridership for the G Line and SERE and half-year
ridership for the N Line.
o It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2020 be established at
2.4%. This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2020 Budget over
the 2019 projection.



Goal 6.5 Maintain bus/light rail operator headcount and bus mechanic headcount within
authorization.
o A change is proposed to add the measurement of Light Rail operator vacancies at ≤ 5.0%
and light rail operators over headcount at ≤ 4.0%. This mirrors the same measure for bus
operators. It is deemed relevant due to system growth and the need to monitor operator
hiring in current labor markets.

With the addition of the measurement for light rail operator vacancies/headcount, there will be 42
proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM which is one higher than for 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 performance measures are being utilized in the development of the final 2020 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopts the attached 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the performance measures
included for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2020, there are 42 proposed performance measures
to be tracked for the GM.
2. Do not adopt the 2020 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance
measures. This is not the recommended action because it results in no measures for ridership,
fare revenue, and total operating revenue and does not aid in the development of the 2020
budget.
