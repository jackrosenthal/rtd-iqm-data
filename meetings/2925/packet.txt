Subject:

Board’s Options Upon Resignation of GM/CEO
per GM/CEO Employment Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended that the Board of Directors elect the option designated as number three under
Section 4(e) of the GM/CEO Employment Agreement.
BACKGROUND
The GM/CEO gave notice to the Board Chair on November 21, 2019 of the GM/CEO’s voluntary
retirement from the agency. The information concerning the GM/CEO’s resignation was shared with the
Board and with the public the next morning. A copy of the GM/CEO’s November 21, 2019 letter is
attached to this Board Report.
DISCUSSION
The GM/CEO Employment Agreement (“Contract”) provides for the voluntary resignation of the GM/CEO
at Section 4(e) of the Contract. Contract, page 5. The Contract is attached to this Board Report. In
summary, in the event of the voluntary resignation of the GM/CEO, the Board may determine, in its own
discretion, which of three options to elect, which options are generally summarized as (1) immediate
termination, (2) place GM/CEO on administrative leave for sixty (60) days, or (3) require GM/CEO to
continue providing services under the Contract for sixty (60) days. The GM/CEO’s November 21, 2019
letter confirmed his commitment to completing his time and working with the Board to assure a
seamless and smooth transition, anticipating a final date of January 20, 2020 for employment.
Informal discussions with each of the Directors have revealed a general consensus to accept the
GM/CEO’s offer to continue working with the Board for up to sixty (60) days, which would suggest that
the Board would favor electing the option designated as number three under Section 4(e) of the
Contract.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Per the Contract, Section 4(e), Regardless of which option the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion,
elects, Mr. Genova agrees that, upon termination of employment, he shall be entitled only to accrued but
unused vacation and accrued unused sick time as set forth in Paragraph 3(c); earned but unpaid Base
Salary, if any; approved expense reimbursements, if any; and any other payments or amounts as may be
required by applicable federal or state employment laws.
ALTERNATIVES
1. The Board may select option (1), termination, which would deprive the agency of any continuing
services of the GM/CEO and would leave the agency without any GM/CEO until an interim
GM/CEO could be appointed.

2. The Board may select option (2), administrative leave, which would deprive the agency of any

Subject:

Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended that the Board of Directors establish procedures for the timely selection of an Interim
General Manager.
BACKGROUND
Upon the resignation of the GM/CEO, the agency must timely select an Interim GM/CEO so that critical
administrative functions are satisfied. Time is of the essence. At least in part, that is the reason that
the Board requires the GM/CEO to have in place at all times the General Manager Succession Plan. The
current General Manager's Succession Plan is attached to this Board Report. Regulators (including the FTA, the
FRA and the PUC), lawmakers, bond rating agencies, stakeholders, collaborators, constituents, agency
employees, and the general public want and deserve to have a responsible individual in charge of the
agency. A seamless transition of authority is central to the agency’s ability to deliver on its mission of
providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective transportation services
throughout the District so that the agency can continue to move people, to their jobs, their homes, their
schools, their health appointments, their recreation and elsewhere.
DISCUSSION
In 2010, following the retirement of GM Cal Marsala, the Board faced the need to hire a new GM/CEO,
something that had not been experienced for over fourteen years. At that time Board Executive
Manager Paula Perdue and Board Chair Lee Kemp collaborated in producing a document entitled, “Board
of Directors Documentation on Process for Hiring/Transitioning to a New General Manager” (“2010
Memo”), which is attached to this Board Report. Two elements of the 2010 Memo are particularly
relevant here.
Section 3.0 of the 2010 Memo provides that the Board Chair will appoint members to an ad hoc
committee to focus on the transition.
Section 4.0 of the 2010 Memo provides that the Board members will name the Interim General Manager
as defined in the General Manager’s Succession Plan or as determined by the approval of the full Board.
The 2010 Memo is the only documentation that the Board Office has been able to discover, following a
diligent search, concerning this process in 2010. That is not particularly notable as the 2010 Memo is
an extended and detailed documentation on process.
On March 12, 2015 the Board received the letter of resignation from GM Phil Washington. The
Executive Committee met in a regularly scheduled session on March 17, 2015 and considered the
matter. The Agenda for that meeting is attached to this Board Report. That Agenda included discussion
of the appointment of a transition team, review of the transition process policy, and a motion to approve
procurement and budget for GM transition, inter alia.

Packet Pg. 18

4.B

The Minutes for the March 17, 2015 Executive Meeting are also attached to this Board Report. The
Minutes reflect that Board Chair Chuck Sisk, pursuant to his powers under the RTD Bylaws to appoint ad
hoc committees, appointed his GM Executive Search Committee. Directors Menten and Lubow were
present at that meeting and asked questions about the process, which were answered by Chair Sisk.
Director Folska was also present and participated in the discussion.
Board Executive Manager Paula Perdue presented to the Executive Committee the 2010 Memo she had
previously prepared and discussed the same at length. Directors Menten, Lubow and Folska were
actively engaged in this discussion. In discussing next steps for the process, Chair Sisk informed the
Executive Committee that they would follow a process of inviting members of the Senior Leadership
Team to submit for the position of Interim General Manager, with invitations going out two days later
(March 19, 2015) and responses due by April 1, with a targeted decision by the full Board on April 10.
The Board conducted its regularly scheduled full Board Meeting on March 24, 2015, at which time Chair
Sisk reported concerning the GM Executive Search Committee he had established, noting that the
Committee had conducted its first meeting that afternoon. He shared that the invitation to apply as
Interim General Manager had gone out to the Senior Leadership Team (as had been discussed in the
March 17 Executive Committee Meeting), with applications due on April 1 and interviews to follow.
March 24, 2015 Board Minutes, Section VII. Those Minutes are attached to this Board Report.
On April 9, 2015, which was 31 days after GM Phil Washington had submitted his letter of resignation,
the Board held a Special Board Meeting in order to adopt a Resolution appointing an Interim General
Manager. The Agenda and Board Report for that Special Board Meeting are attached to this Board
Report. Noting in the Resolution that “the RTD Board of Directors desire to maintain continuity and
stability during the transition period while a permanent General Manager replacement is found,” the
Board appointed Dave Genova as the Interim General Manager. The Resolution was adopted as
Resolution No. 002, Series of 2015, and was signed by Board Chair Sisk and Board Secretary Jeff
Walker.
On April 14, 2015 the GM Executive Search Committee conducted a meeting to develop an action plan
for the executive search and to approve a form for the RFP for an executive search firm. The agenda
and materials for that meeting are attached to this Board Report.
If and as any further materials are discovered concerning the search process in 2015, the same will be
made available to the Board.
In sum, the departure of a General Manager in 2010 and again in 2015 necessitated the timely
appointment of an Interim General Manager. Information is not currently available as to how long the
process took in 2010, but our best guess is that the process was conducted in a prompt manner. In
2015 the process took just 31 days from the receipt of the resignation.
Both the 2010 and the 2015 processes relied upon an ad hoc committee appointed by the Chair to
facilitate the Board search and were informed, but not controlled, by the General Manager’s Succession
Plan.
In 2019 this Board must now determine the process for selecting an Interim General Manager, either by
confirming the process instituted and followed by the Board in 2010 and again in 2015, or by crafting a
new process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Appoint as Interim General Manager one of the three individuals named by General Manager
Genova in the General Manager's Succession Plan.
2. Solicit applications (from both inside and outside the agency) from the Senior Leadership Team
and also from appropriate candidates who have shown the ability to effectively manage large
organizations.
Use normal channels of announcement, plus word of mouth and outreach by all on the Board, to
garner as many viable applications as possible.
The Executive Committee will oversee the interim GM announcement, receive applications and
conduct a preliminary screening of the applicants/applications. Information about all prospects will
remain confidential.
For the purposes of the interim position, an application need be no more than a resume plus a
Letter of Interest to the Executive Committee. These will be due in by December 23.
The Executive Committee will present to the Board all submittals, indicating if it wishes, the top
two each of internal and external applicants, by January 3.
The Board as a whole will then determine some appropriate number of individuals to interview, by
Special Board Meeting, with the urgent goal of making the appointment effective by the date of
Dave Genova’s departure.
3. Prepare an RFP for the engagement of an Executive Search Firm to conduct a nationwide search
for the position of Interim General Manager, approve the RFP, select an Executive Search Firm
from RFP respondents to conduct the search, review and then select an applicant from
candidates recruited to serve as Interim General Manager.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. Alternatives 1 and 2. The expected timeline for this interim role will continue until a permanent
replacement for this position can be hired. During this period of time, an upgrade in compensation
to reflect the appropriate adjustment of 10% of current base salary, or minimum of the salary
range, whichever is greater will be applied.
2. Alternative 3 would come with a substantial financial impact to the agency as recruiting from the
outside is costly and takes a much longer period of time to make a placement. An internal interim
to an interim external placement would need to take place if an external candidate were not
identified by January 20, 2020 because of financial signing authority.

Process Overview

This document defines the process that was followed by the RTD Board of
Directors for the hiring of a new General Manager following the resignation of the
current General Manager. Prior to this time, a General Manager had not been hired
in over fourteen years so no processes had been documented. This process
addresses most of the major concerns during the transition and can be used as a
guide for future hiring/transitioning to a new General Manager for the RTD transit
agency.

Current CEO Notification of Resignation/Retirement Process
Typically, the General Manager will notify the Board Chair. The Board Chair
will notify the rest of the Board members in the most expedient and
confidential manner possible.
Board Chair will attempt to negotiate a forty-five day notice period from the
General Manager or in accordance with the terms stated in the General
Manager’s contract.
Please refer to the General Manager Succession Plan located in Part VII (6)
of the Board Governance Manual
Board Chair and Executive Committee should discuss how to handle public
relations.
Determine what announcement or press release should be
provided to the community, elected officials and stakeholders.
Work collaboratively with the General Manager on message to be shared
with employees.
Search Committee/Transition Team Selection
Board Chair will appoint members to an ad hoc committee to focus on this
transition. This Committee and members may be a newly appointed
Committee or may be the activation of the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee. Ideally members of this Committee
will reflect the agency’s goal for diversity.
The Chair of the Transition Team will mobilize his team to develop a
transition planning strategy—meetings, timelines, communications, etc.
They will review the succession plan to see what it says about the interim
position.

The Transition Team representative will provide confidential information to
Civic Leader Panelists on candidates at the appropriate time (i.e. resumes,
etc)
The Transition Team will provide a private venue for Civic Leader Panelists
to conduct interviews.
The Civic Leader Panelists will be asked to sign a confidential form of nondisclosure.
Selecting Prospects, Candidates and Finalists
The Transition Team and full Board need to be very clear in identifying the
different stages of the application process. Prospects are defined in the
early stage as individuals who may self-submit or come as recommended
from others as a good potential for the position. Many of these prospects
may be gainfully employed and a revelation of their names and interest could
have detrimental effects on their career. During this early stage, the names
of the prospects are treated in the most confidential manner and are not
public information.
The names of prospects who show potential and have been screened by the
National Executive Search firm could be presented on an intermediate short
Candidate list (18-20) names to the Transition Committee for further
screening and determination if there is an interest in interviewing the
candidate (iterative process).
The Transition Team will review the resumes and implement a process to
determine if candidates from the short list meet their criteria. Approval will
be obtained from the full Board on the short list of names for interviewing.
All information is handled and processed as confidential on potential
candidates including location, hotel and travel accommodations and
interviewing venue.
Finalists are considered those candidates who have been identified by the
Board as the top 3-4 candidates and who they want to bring back for a final
interview. Colorado State statutes require a public announcement to be
made at least 14 days prior to appointing or electing a finalist to the
position.
Finalists will also have been screened, reference and background checks
performed by the National Executive Search Firm. Finalists will be required
to complete the RTD Employment Application Form.
Press notification is made for public release of the names of the finalist/s.
The Interview Process
The interview process is used to further screen potential candidates and to
narrow the choices down to a critical few who may become finalists.
One or several forms of interview types can be used to further drill in on a
candidate’s competency and his/her potential match to the position: phone
interviews, Interactive Video, group interviews, and return interviews.

The Transition Team may elect to conduct two forms of interviews: The
“softball” approach where top candidates are asked to meet with the Board
members in a more informal exchange manner to determine if there is mutual
interest. The follow-up interview called the “Hardball” is used once this list
of top candidates are narrowed down to the critical few or top finalists.
Questions in this interview are intended to challenge the candidate in terms
of visionary, strategic and out of the box thinking. The Hardball interview
may be professionally video graphed.
The Transition Team will solicit interview questions from the full Board and
will develop a list of 5-7 strategic questions that will be asked of each of the
candidates (Transition Team Working group). These questions will be
handled and retained in a confidential manner until the day of the interviews.
Copies will be limited and controlled distribution.
The Transition Team will define the process they will use in the interview
process (i.e. who will ask the questions, if the full Board will participant or
only the Transition Team with the rest of the members as silent observers,
how questions will be fielded, etc)
Prior to the selection of the finalists, the maintenance of confidentiality is
extremely important and Board members are strongly encouraged not to
accept calls from the media or others related to this matter until press
release has been made on the finalists (3-4). This discussion should be held
with the full Board.
When the Board has agreed upon the top 3-4 candidates who will become
finalists, a press release announcement will be released to the General
Public. According to Colorado Law, this public announcement should be
made at least 14 days prior to appointing or electing one of the finalists to
fill the position (CRS 24-6-402 (3.5)
The Transition Team may also consider having members of the team to visit
the home base of the top candidates for information gathering purposes.
Discussions and interviews of candidates for the General Manager position
can be held in executive sessions subject to the requirements of CRS 24-6-

402 (4).

Hosting a Stakeholder Forum (Reception)
Once the Finalists have been identified, the Transition Team will host an
open stakeholder forum to introduce the finalists to the community (i.e.
stakeholders, elected officials, employees, and Senior Leadership staff).
This event will be publicized and interested parties will be encouraged to
attend.
The Finalists make a 5 minute introductory remark followed by an
opportunity for the guests to ask more direct questions in a small group
setting. Guests will be able to move around in various discussion groups
with the finalists. Afterwards, the participating guests will be asked to
complete a stakeholder’s comment card which will be summarized and
results provided to the Transition Team (and full Board) the next day.

The Selection and Notification Process
The selection of a new General Manager will be made by the full Board
based on a myriad of input sources and processes: Input from stakeholders
and employees on General Manager’s traits and qualities; Board assessment
of leadership needed; Input from Civic Leaders Panel on strengths and
weaknesses of the candidates; Input from participants at the stakeholder’s
Forum, evaluations from interviews and other sources of pertinent
information.
Board members will discuss and rank who they feel is the top person for the
job. The goal will be to have full consensus.
If an obvious leader does not emerge, Board members will revisit their
process with the Public Affairs Consultant and the National Executive Search
Firm to define next steps.
Once a recommendation is reached the Board members will convene in
either a special Board meeting or regular Board meeting for an official vote.
All of the finalists will be notified of the decision via phone by the Chair of
the Transition Team as soon as possible. This will be followed up by a letter
to the Finalists thanking them for their consideration.
A Press Release of the Hiring will be made by the RTD Public Affairs.

negotiation team. It may be the Chair of the Board with assistance from the
General Counsel.
The Transition Team should provide the contract negotiation team with the
parameters and compensation guidelines for the negotiation that was
previously reviewed and approved by the full Board.
The Transition Team/Negotiator should consider using an external
employment attorney for the crafting of the contract and negotiation terms.
If so, a RFP for competitive services is required.
The General Counsel (or designate) will vet the proposed terms of the
contract (i.e. salary, benefits, pension, etc) through appropriate entities such
as the attorney over pension benefits, CFO, or the actuary and financial
audit to validate the financial impact on the agency through the contract
period.
The Negotiator will work with the National Executive Search Firm as the
intermediate to the selected General Manager. If desired, he may also work
directly with the selected General Manager.
The Negotiator will keep the Transition Team advised of progress and will
solicit input from the Transition Team/Board on issues that may fall outside
the guidelines and parameters of the approved negotiation.

April 3. In preparation for these interviews, sub-committees need to be
looking at two components:
i. Develop a criteria for Evaluating/selecting the GM-Director Tobiassen
to lead
ii. Work on possible questions for interview-Chair Sisk
Paula would compile the list of questions which will also be reviewed/modified
by the committee on March 31. The final list of questions will be vetted with
Human Resources and vaulted for confidentiality until the interviews.
c. Discussion on Criteria for Evaluating/Selection of Interim GM
The committee decided that as a starting point, they would resurrect the
criteria and the questions used in 2009 and solicit input from the full Board.
The criteria with weights and scoreboard would be worked on by Director
Tobiassen who would bring some recommendations forward on March 31.
c. Process for Interviews
The committee discussed the process for the interview and will need to
come up with how the interviews will be conducted. Will the full Board be
involved in a silent mode? Will there be a lead person on the committee
asking the questions or will they use a round-robin approach for questioning?
d. Special Board meeting
The committee will bring forth a recommended action for the selection of
the Interim General Manager before the full Board for approval. A special
Board meeting is needed for this action. Possible times for a Special Board
meeting could be April 9 following the Stand Up4Transportation event.
III. Assignment of Buddy System
Committee members began the assignment of Buddies. They noted that each of
them would have two buddies.
Chair Sisk—Directors Lasater & Director Walker
Director Bagley—Directors Anderson and James
Director Deadwyler—Directors Folska and Lubow
Director Tobiassen-Directors Archuleta and Solano
Director Francone-Directors Menten and Hoy
Committee members are responsible for contacting their buddies within 24 hours of
the meeting.
IV. Calendaring for Meeting Schedule
Paula Perdue presented a draft timeline of activities over the next couple of weeks.
As soon as the strategic advisory service is named, they will expound upon these
activities and timelines. She noted this is a very aggressive schedule. She also
noted planned time off by committee members but that the process will continue in
their stead. Chair Sisk noted it is important that people have a life.
V. Begin work on communications plan
Paula Perdue indicated it is important that the Committee have a communications
plan which minimally need to include these elements: Who they will be targeting,
what the key messages will be, timing and frequency of communications,
communications channels and who will deliver the message. The buddy system as
identified will be one of the primary ways the Board will communicate with each
Packet Pg. 44

Attachment: 03.24.15 GMESC Minutes (4018 : Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO)

4.B.d

other. Copies of the minutes from the meetings will be disseminated within three
days of the meeting. Chair Sisk will also plan on including a monthly update at the
Board meetings.
Director Bagley emphasized that this communications plan is very critical. One of
the primary task of the strategic advisory service will be to help the Committee
develop a comprehensive plan for how we communicate internally and externally.
He noted that in 2009 we engaged a number of stakeholders and others in this
process. The full Board will need to step up and meet with designated people in
the community. Chair Sisk noted we have former Board members ready to help as
well as CAC, Transit Alliance, etc.
Director Deadwyler suggested one of the ways we could start is making sure after
each meeting, we identify the key messages we want to take forward. Director
Tobiassen added we could follow this up as an email distribution. Director
Tobiassen also suggested we look at using the web based notification process for
the topic of “GM Executive Search.” He also suggested we use the Monday
Morning Q to communicate key messages to the employees.
Paula Perdue indicated she would start a draft plan. Director Bagley offered to
assist.
VI. Discuss Transition Team members (2) meet with SLT
The Committee discussed meeting with Senior Leadership to understand their
issues and concerns. Suggested date for this meeting is April 15 or after the
selection of an interim. Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen will attend the meeting.
VII. RFP for Strategic Advisory Service-Evaluation Committee & Selection Criteria
Paula Perdue indicated the RFP for Strategic Advisory Service was submitted to
four bidders. Responses are due March 27. The evaluation team will consist of
Directors Bagley and Deadwyler, Paula Perdue and Linda Wells, Procurement Agent.
The evaluation team will plan to meet on Tuesday, March 31 prior to the GM
Executive Search Committee to review responses and possibly come up with a
recommendation for the Committee.
VIII. Discuss GM Effective Termination Date/Payoff Schedule
The Committee discussed possible effective last day for GM based around the
upcoming schedule to hire a GM and close out key business. Chair Sisk will have a
conversation with General Manager relative to this issue.
IX. Create next step timeline-see the working calendar for this committee
X. Other matters
a. GM Task Goals for 2016—The committee discussed the task goals from the
March 21 joint strategic planning advance. They discussed the feasibility of
delaying the next steps which would normally be the General Manager
would come before the Board at the April 28 study session with detailed
implementation plans. The Committee was concerned not to delay the
budget calendar and felt initially the April 28 should still be a target. A

asked Bruce Abel, AGM of Bus Operations, and Mike Gil, Deputy AGM of Bus Operations,
to join them.
Bruce Abel said that Kevin is retiring after 35 years of service at RTD. He started in 1980
as a bus operator. Mike Gil shared that an interesting part of Kevin’s career is that he is
one of the few that remember the layoffs in 1981-1982. He drove a bus for 5 years,
went to the Alameda division as a Dispatcher, moved to District Shops as a Lead
Dispatcher and spent the last part of his career as a Division Manager at multiple RTD
divisions. Mike Gil said that he has been one outstanding asset to RTD and he will be
missed terribly.
Kevin St. Croix said it has been a great career at RTD. He remembers coming to a Board
meeting and telling the Directors they were dysfunctional during some very public
disputes, which was a shaky time in his career. There were some good times and bad
times but for the most part it was a great place to work. He thanked RTD for the privilege
to work here.
Chair Sisk congratulated Kevin on his retirement and thanked him for his years of service.
He said that our employees make the District the success that it is.

Doug Gragg, Denver, said his concern this evening is for the selection committee for
the General Manager. He realizes that there is the political practice of RTD looking
nationally for a new General Manager, he believes that if the Board looked locally
within the District the committee could find a minority woman that could fill the
position. There is no need to go to NY City to do it.
Gary Van Dorn, National Federation of the Blind Board Member and President of the
National Federation of the Blind CO Chapter, expressed the NFBCO’s concern over the
recent outage of the automated stop announcements. While they were happy that the
RTD sent out a very clear and concise email about the issue that also asked drivers to
announce the stops, many drivers failed to do so. He requested that RTD provide the
NFBCO with an explanation of what caused such a catastrophic failure in the
automated stop announcement system.
Shantá Farrington, Denver, works as a Community Organizer for Front Range Economic
Strategy Center (FRESC). This organization provides outreach and support, especially
to low-income and disadvantaged communities, during community engagement
processes. She said that FRESC supports the Mile High Connects fare proposal; they
hope that prior to any decisions related to fare in the next few weeks the community’s
voice will be heard.
Joe Tripplet, Denver, expressed concern over the proposed increases to the Access-aRide fare. He worries that eventually Access-a-Ride riders, especially seniors and the
disabled, will no longer be able to afford the cost of this service. He recognized that
while Access-a-Cab is a great alternative, it is not a realistic alternative in the outlying
areas of the District. He asked staff to provide him the rule that Access-a-Ride fare
must be twice the fare of a comparable fixed route.
Andrea Suhaka, Denver, DRMAC Board Member and Chair of the Transportation
Solutions Arapahoe County, has been very involved in the fare study that Mile High
connects is conducting. She believes our low-income community is very
disadvantaged with the new fares RTD is proposing. She thinks the fares for lowincome riders should be at the senior discount price or lower; people that depend on
RTD for their living need to have a lower fare.
Richard McClintock, Denver, has been a long time smart growth and livable
communities advocate. He looks forward to participating in RTD’s upcoming fare
study public hearings; however, he is here tonight for a very different reason. He
would like to thank General Manager Washington for his service. He can only say that
this is a loss for RTD and LA’s gain. He stated that the motto of building as much as
we can as fast as we can has really come to fruition based on his leadership. Rick

McClintock recognized the challenge ahead of the Board in finding a new GM who is as
smart and capable as GM Washington.
Kenny Shepard, Denver, expressed his concern over the new proposed fare to DIA. He
believes RTD will get more revenue if we lower the fare to one that is comparable to
other large cities, like $5.
Hanni Raly, The Arc of Aurora, spoke on behalf of the intellectually and
developmentally disabled community. She said that many of the individuals they work
with are dependent upon government assistance, low-income, and rely upon public
transportation. They see transportation as the conduit for full community inclusion,
recognizing that annually 560,000 people with disabilities never leave their home
because of transportation difficulties. In looking at the proposed fare structure, her
organization knows this number will only grow if adopted. She expressed frustration
that her organization is unable to participate in the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare
Program as it is today, limiting their ability to assist their community that cannot afford
our fares. The administrative burdens, cumbersome tracking requirements and huge
upfront costs preclude their participation since they receive no public funding. She
believes that in order for the program to be fully realized RTD needs to:
o Consider decreasing the administrative burdens and tracking components
o Consider offering a deeper discount or sliding scale for organizations that work with
low-income populations
o Consider expanding the program for offering payment options that do not require a
complete upfront investment
o Consider allowing cooperatives for non-profit organizations
She stated that by increasing access to programs that increase access to transit all of
our communities win.
Ana Barrera-Ochoa, Denver, spoke not only on behalf of FRESC but also on behalf of
the low-income and working class families. These groups are very concerned that the
fares are going to increase. The working class families are already struggling; it is very
important they are taken into consideration as part of RTD’s fare study. She said that
not only are many of these families transit reliant but they also need transportation for
better jobs and opportunities.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Committee Chair Bagley commented that the Board and Senior Leadership Team had the
planning advance for 2016 over the weekend. The goal of this advance was to define
specific task goals for the General Manager and Agency for 2016. He said that the GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee would begin working with the Interim
General Manager in late April to establish the tactical plans for achieving these goals.
Chair Sisk noted that the GM Executive Search Committee has been established and
includes Directors Bagley, Deadwyler, Francone, Tobiassen and himself as Chair of the
Committee. The Committee had their first meeting this afternoon and achieved a great
deal. Chair Sisk recognized the work of Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board, as
she was instrumental in making sure it was a good first meeting. He shared that an
invitation to apply was extended to the Senior Leadership team. The deadline for
applications is April 1st, interviews will be conducted shortly thereafter, with a goal of
appointing an Interim General Manager the week of April 6th at a Special Board Meeting.
He noted that the Committee is moving promptly and efficiently so there is a smooth
transition. Chair Sisk recognized this is a large undertaking but it will be done in a very
transparent way with input from employees, stakeholders, public, etc.

General Manager's Report
General Manager Washington thanked the Board, and particularly Chair Sisk, for
understanding his decision to move to LA Metro and their support during this process. He
also thanked the stakeholders, staff, mayors, commissioners and CDOT. GM Washington
said that what has been accomplished over the last six years, which is quite a bit, was
really a joint and team effort. He recognized that six years ago there was not much going
on but now the West Line is open with 5 more openings coming in 2015. He is very
proud of the work the team has done. GM Washington believes that we will not fully
realize what we have accomplished for a couple decades when our grandchildren and
great-grandchildren are using the transit infrastructure built under our watch.

Packet Pg. 52

Attachment: 03.24.15 Board Meeting Minutes (4018 : Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO)

Chair Sisk reviewed the following events and awards that Board members participated in
during the month of March:

GM Washington shared that on March 6th USDOT announced a pilot program and
regulatory change that will allow transportation agencies to utilize local hiring preferences
on USDOT funded projects. In this pilot USDOT made no provision for comment and they
allowed 30 days for comment on a permanent regulatory change. He said that APTA has
submitted a request to extend the comment period and would like to host a webinar for
USDOT to explain what these provisions mean. To date USDOT has not acted on the
request for an extension. He stated the current comment period ends April 6. APTA will
still have a webinar on March 26th at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss this provision and
any legal issues that may arise. GM Washington noted that the transit industry, especially
the supply/private part of the industry, is pushing back on these provisions, especially as it
relates to rolling stock. He believes this webinar will do a good job in answering some of
the questions out there. He asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to explain this provision as
it relates to Colorado Laws.
Marla Lien explained that the change in regulation deals only with local hiring preferences
pertaining to the use of labor. In Colorado, the only statute on Colorado labor on public
works does not apply to RTD; it applies to counties, school districts and municipalities
requiring Colorado labor to perform 80% of the work on a public works project. She
stated that RTD does not have a local hiring preference policy nor do we have a state law
applicable to labor on project. In Colorado there are other statutes that would be
implicated if the statute expands; there is a preference regarding commodities and services
and there are bid preferences on public projects. Both of these statutes do include RTD.
Marla Lien explained that those are not currently addressed by the regulatory change but
the webinar will discuss what other kinds of labor or contracting could be affected by local
hiring preferences if USDOT expands the program. She stated that she is not concerned
about this regulatory change diminishing competition on RTD’s projects even if the
program goes forward.
GM Washington explained that this is one of USDOT Secretary Foxx’s initiatives called
ladders of opportunity. The idea is to ensure that local workers benefit from economic
opportunities that transportation projects present.
GM Washington noted that a memo outlining the proposed Flatiron Flyer milestones would
be sent to the Board. The proposed dates are:
 June 30, 2015 – Media events announcing the arrival of the Flatiron Flyer pilot bus
 August 13, 2015 – Opening of Boulder Junction
 October 24, 2015 – Station Ribbon Cutting and Parties, full Flatiron Flyer fleet
arrival
 January 17, 2015 – BRT service change

Director Menten asked for clarification if USDOT would be participating in the APTA
webinar. She expressed concern that we would not really be able to learn how this might
affect RTD if USDOT is not participating. GM Washington said that USDOT had not
confirmed their involvement but APTA plans to host the webinar either way. He thinks
that even if they do not officially participate there will be some USDOT representatives on
the phone hearing the questions/concerns.

Authorization to execute a budget transfer to purchase thermal printers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an
amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install
the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare
structure.
Director Tobiassen shared that as the Chair of the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee, he has been speaking with many Board members and staff, and it is clear
there are still a number of questions that need to be addressed. Director Tobiassen
requested that this item be removed from this evening’s agenda and brought back to the
Board at the April 21, 2015 Board meeting. This would also allow for staff to provide a
more in-depth explanation of this item at the April 14, 2015 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting to ensure everyone’s questions are answered.
Director Anderson expressed concern that postponing this item might set back the
openings scheduled for 2016. General Manager Washington stated that he and Director
Tobiassen had discussed this item. He stated that he does not have concerns about the
timeline for the 2016 openings if this item is delayed until the next Board meeting.
Director Menten inquired if staff had consulted with the bond counsel at this time. Marla
Lien stated that was one of the things being worked on prior to the committee meeting
briefing.
This item was delayed until the April 21, 2015 Board Meeting.

General Manager Washington thanked the RTD staff, led by Pauletta Tonilas, for all of
their efforts related to Stand Up for Transportation Day on April 9th. This is hugely
important for infrastructure in this country as May 31 is the end date for MAP-21. He
stated that this event is gaining steam and brining attention to the issue. He thanked the
Directors for their support and participation.
Director Folska thanked staff for all their efforts surrounding Stand Up for Transportation.
She had her bus signing event recently and there were so many people signing that she
does not think there is room for even one more signature. She recognized the wonderful
job that GM Washington has done within the District and thanked him for his efforts.
Director Menten expressed her appreciation for having the RTD Board/Senior Leadership
Team Advance within the District. She knows of government bodies that feel it is better
to take an expensive trip outside their area, which she does not support.
Director Bagley stated that, in reference to the Strategic Planning Advance, there has
never been any thought of having this anyplace but close to the Blake Street offices and
within the District.
Director Lasater shared that he recently attended a Southwest (SW) Rail Extension
meeting hosted by Director Bagley. He complimented Director Bagley on having such an
informative and well attended meeting. He believes there was some very good dialogue
related to the future of the SW Rail Extension.
Director Bagley thanked Director Lasater for his attendance at the meeting. He noted that
he has been working with staff for the last 6 months about the SW Rail Extension; the
model for the Southeast Rail Extension has motivated his community to look at ways to
move their extension forward. He thanked staff and GM Washington for their
involvement.

Recommended Action
Chair Sisk read into record the Resolution for Appointment of an Interim General
Manager and asked for a motion.

Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve
the appointment of David Genova as Interim
General Manager.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion:

The motion passed with 10 in favor (Anderson,
Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Francone, Hoy,
James, Sisk, Tobiassen and Walker) and 2
opposed (Lasater and Lubow).

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.
Chair Sisk congratulated David Genova. He said that this was a very difficult decision as
there were two very strong applicants. He shared that he spoke to Bruce Abel after the
decision was made and he was the first to extend his congratulations to Dave Genova.
Chair Sisk stated that he is convinced this is a working staff that is committed to one
thing: RTD.

GM EXECUTIVE SEARCH COMMITTEE
Tuesday, April 14 2015 at 3:00 p.m.
3rd Floor Board Conference Room
Board Staff Contact: Paula Perdue
Call in: 303-299-2663 (in-state); 1-800-776-7497 (out of state)
ID Number: 15120
Chaired by:
Chair Sisk
I. Call to Order
Chair Sisk called the meeting to order at 3:05 p.m. In attendance were Chair Sisk,
Committee members Director Tobiassen, Director Deadwyler, Director Bagley and
Director Francone. Also in attendance were Director Folska and Paula Perdue,
Executive Director for the Board.
Special guests included Roger Sherman, CRL Strategic Advisory Services; Brian Iacono,
Procurement Manager and Linda Wells, Procurement Agent (4:00 p.m.).
II. Draft Comprehensive Communications Plan Discussion (R. Sherman)
Roger Sherman provided a draft handout for developing a comprehensive
communications plan. He provided a building block approach for receiving input and
for providing information. A distinction was made between the input process of
providing opportunities for formal input by community/civic leaders, key
stakeholders/community leaders, internal employees and the general public. The
committee discussed the possibility of using a moderated focus group of 10-12 highlevel executive representatives from key categories such as Chamber/EDC,
Mayors/elected officials, higher education, healthcare, nonprofit, City Manager, large
employer, small employer, business community and legislative. Roger emphasized the
importance of having key decision makers from representative organizations with
experience in hiring at the executive level and who have run large organizations for this
focus group.
Several ideas were shared around using focus groups to obtain employee input and

Treasurer – Larry Hoy, District J

4.B.h

Roger Sherman took the action item to begin working on what might be appropriate
categories for the focus group. Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen will meet with the
Senior Leadership Team next week as part of a listening process to understand the
concerns of this leadership group.
Paula Perdue will investigate in-house capabilities for providing survey monkey to
obtain employee input and general public input.
Pertaining to information, the question is how critical is it to provide regular updates to
interested stakeholders and the general public using customized methods to deliver a
consistent message. Some of the questions to address are who are the audience,
components of mass communications to the external audiences, targeted audiences
and when do we need to communicate. Roger emphasized we need to communicate
where there are opportunities for input, key milestones and major decisions.
Otherwise, the information is redundant and non-beneficial.
Other ideas such as town hall meetings, open forums hosted by other organizations
and engaging with local newspapers were all discussed. The use of social media was
also discussed. The committee will continue to discuss and begin to ferret down on
those options that will meet the goals for obtaining input and sharing meaningful
information.
Initial energies will be on identifying categories and possible names for the high-level
focus group, sources for internal communications such as employee listening sessions
or online surveys, including the meeting with Senior Leadership, and ways/when to
include the general public. Roger Sherman will also begin developing a schedule to see
how these communication input and information actions might roll into the schedule.
The committee discussed how this communications outreach process might roll into
the process of determining the skillsets desired for a General Manager. The Committee
felt the information on attributes from the joint strategic planning advance is a good
start.
III. Communications Process Flow
Chair Sisk indicated that communications relate to this search needs to be very
sensitive and respect the desires of the Board of Directors. We need to make sure that
all communications are properly coordinated with the Committee with their buddy
input. We discussed the issue of the Press Release on the Interim General Manager
Packet Pg. 66

Attachment: 04.14.15 GMESC minutes (4018 : Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO)

working with our riders to obtain input. The committee concluded that various
channels and opportunities will be explored to obtain input from community
organizations, employees and the general public that could include such things as
online surveys, small discussion groups, listening sessions, open forums and use of
Citizen Advisory Services. Director Bagley expressed that this is quite a time
consuming process so the committee needs to think about how to properly scale this
outreach effort.

4.B.h

The Committee felt that an accurate press release from the GM Executive Search
Committee is critical and the Board Chair and Executive Director of the Board will craft
the press releases with input and guidance from Roger Sherman, CRL. Committee
Chair Sisk also requested Roger Sherman and Paula Perdue to work with the in-house
Communications group on the process to ensure communications do not get altered
without the consent of the Committee.
IV. RFP for Executive Search firm
Chair Sisk posed the question on if there are other alternatives for the General Manager
search than employing an Executive Search firm. He wanted to question the
hypothesis on if a RFP is required. (I.e. can this be done in-house or are there other
models for hiring of executives that we should consider). Roger Sherman referenced
how CU Benson was hired and a reference was made to the LA model where General
Manager Washington was hired by the Mayor of Los Angeles. Chair Sisk inquired of
the cost for the Executive Search firm in 2009. Brian Iacono reminded the group that
we actually asked for two set of searches: one for a General Manager and another for
a Capitals Program Manager. In the end, the Board decided on one position. Relative
to that search, the estimated cost for the GM was approximately $40K with another
$30K for expenses. He would anticipate that cost to be a little higher in 2015.
The Committee discussed the merits of trying to do this process in-house. Brian
Iacono did note that we had performed a national search for some of the Assistant
General Manager’s positons; however, it is perceived that the RFP process provides us
with a negotiated procurement process and helps in finding high caliber candidates.
Director Deadwyler pointed out that we have a number of internal issues with using inhouse that includes capabilities, confidentiality, commitment to diversity and trust
factors that would affect her ability to support an in-house process. We know that all
eyes are on us and we need to focus on the best and most objective process to secure
the best and the brightest GM for this agency.
The Committee concurred that the RFP process is our best option and the cost for such
a visible search is appropriate.
Brian Iacono walked through a couple of important sections of the RFP, namely the
time schedule, the criteria for selection and the scope of work. He addressed a couple
of questions by Director Francone around the DBE/SBE requirements. He stated that
while we do not necessarily have a specific goal, this will be reviewed by our Civil
Rights department to make sure it is appropriate. Although there may not be a goal,
we like to encourage our bidders to consider SBE/DBE for subcontracting opportunities.

and noted the released press release was not the one that had been worked on by
members of the Executive Search committee. The Committee discussed some of the
concerns around not having proper controls over the communications that get released.
Committee members expressed an expectation that the Strategic Advisor Service
Consultant would help guide us with communications throughout this process.

4.B.h

Director Bagley inquired of Paula and Linda if they had looked at the scope of work and
what was their take. Linda responded the scope is similar to the 2009 scope of work
and may have some bias toward the two positions that we advertised for in 2009.
Paula indicated she did not think this was the issue but in drilling down on the scope of
work, she thinks there are a couple of things that this gives to the Board. First, the
scope of work puts much of the onus for screening out candidates who do not meet
qualifications on the Executive Search firm and the firm only brings back to the Board
the top 20 or so of qualified candidates. In 2009, we had over 250 applicants that
were screened by the Executive Search firm; secondly, this removes the Board
members from getting caught up with having to address friends or others who want to
apply for the position. We use the same process for all candidates and they are
referred to our Executive Search firm for the screening process; thirdly, the scope of
work helps to address some of the concerns around confidentiality of candidates who
might want to apply for this position.
The Committee decided to proceed with the RFP process. Paula and Linda will make
the indicated changes to the procurement document and scope of work. Paula will
also provide a copy of the list of bidders from 2009 which has been modified to
include local search firms, and search firms recommended highly by Squires Patton and
Boggs and other trusted people.
The targeted schedule for the RFP is:
4/28/15

5/8/15
Inquiry period
5/15/15
RTD responds to inquiries

V. Key Messages from Meeting
a. Committee is making progress on its transition plan to replace the General
Manager. The Committee has hired CRL as its strategic advisory service to
help develop a comprehensive communications and outreach plan that will
ensure transparency, openness and inclusiveness in our process; we have
named Dave Genova as the Interim General Manager and we will be sending
out an RFP for an Executive Search firm by the end of April. We are on
target with our process.
VI. Other Matters
There were no other matters.
VII. Motion to Move into Executive Session

Brian Iacono indicated we will advertise for an Executive Search firm in various news
media such as the APTA Passenger Transport and the Transit Talent. Paula added the
Transit Talent may also be another source for us to obtain benchmarking data.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Board of Directors

From:

Doug Tisdale, Board Chair & Director, District

GM

Date:

November 27, 2019

Board Meeting Date: December 3, 2019

Subject:

Begin Discussion of Procedures for Selection of
Permanent GM/CEO

DISCUSSION
All of the materials attached to the Board Report for Agenda Item B concerning Determination of
Procedures for Designating Interim GM/CEO are relevant to an initial discussion of procedures for
selection of a new permanent GM/CEO. As such, those items are incorporated by this reference into
this Board Report concerning Agenda Item C. This matter is equally important as the selection of an
Interim General Manager, but it does not possess quite the same degree of urgency. The selection of a
new GM/CEO in 2015 was a carefully considered and transparent process that effectively commenced
on March 12, 2015 and was initially concluded in mid-December 2015 (with the selection of Dave
Genova as GM/CEO), but not finally concluded until an employment agreement was finally negotiated
and executed in mid-March 2016. The Board Office has secured information from APTA confirming that
a new GM/CEO selection process typically takes longer than the 12 months taken by RTD in 2015.
The Board’s discussion on December 3 is an opportunity to consider and understand the similar
processes followed in 2010 and again in 2015, while at the same time exploring whether there are other
“best practices” that have evolved in the transportation industry in the last four years. In either event,
the Board may appropriately be informed and guided by past Board-approved procedures.
One of the logistical matters that needs to be addressed initially is the selection of a GM Executive
Search Committee. This GMES Committee has historically been appointed in order to facilitate a more
timely selection process. Were the full Board to act as a Committee of the Whole in this process it is
reasonably anticipated that significantly more time, and conceivably more cost, would be required. The
GMES Committee would to facilitate and focus the Board’s process, with a view toward concluding the
work in the most expeditious, effective and economical way possible, at all times being subject to the
Board and not charged with responsibility for making final selection decisions.
And as was true in 2010 and in 2015, transparency, diversity and inclusion should be the guideposts for
any process adopted by the Board.
Let the discussion begin.
