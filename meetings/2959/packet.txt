Service reduction will negatively
impact customers
Operators want/need the overtime

Operators believe increased pay
and benefits will attract and
retain operators

“I like having overtime. I'm used
to the money. Anything less
would not be enough.”
“I rely on my income to take care
of my family and my bills.”
“Most passengers have come to
depend on a consistent, reliable

OPERATOR SHORTAGE


RTD is considering a proposal to temporarily reduce service in response to an ongoing
labor shortage, as well as issues with recruiting and retaining bus and light rail
operators.



Many bus and rail operators have been mandated to work six-day work weeks for the
past four years.



Mandating is the single biggest factor affecting retention of new RTD operators; it
affects their quality of life.



RTD has seen a noticeable increase over the past four years in the number of operators
taking leave because of family medical reasons, sickness or on-the-job injuries. This year
alone through September, the amount of work hours lost to these types of leaves
equates to 82 operators being out for a whole year.



Safety and reliability are among our core values and both are compromised when RTD
has to mandate operators.



The public is well aware of our labor issues and the effects they are having on our
service, our riders and, especially, our operators.



The objective of the proposal is to better align our staffing with a level of service that
RTD can reliably deliver.



While RTD is providing a high overall level of service, the agency is dropping service
even with mandates in place.



Commuter rail service is operated by Denver Transit Partners which includes the
University of Colorado A Line, B Line and G Line.



The N Line will be operated by RTD when it opens in 2020. RTD is confident that there
will be enough operators trained and ready when it opens.



RTD cannot use light rail and commuter rail operators interchangeable because the
trains and operations are different.

Attachment: Fact Sheet Temporary Service Reduction Proposal (4012 : Communication Outreach)

Operator Shortage/Temporary Service Reduction Proposal
Fact Sheet

2.1.b



RTD conducted a public input process to inform RTD’s process on the proposed
temporary service reduction.



A series of outreach activities occurred from Nov. 4-17, including an online survey,
telephone town hall, pop-up events at select bus and light rail stations throughout the
district, and a social media campaign.



The public was asked to weigh in on RTD service and whether they support or oppose a
service reduction in favor of increasing reliability.



Feedback from RTD employees, the general public and key stakeholders will be
presented to the Board of Directors, which will provide guidance to RTD staff on
whether to pursue a temporary service reduction plan.



Decisions are made with a regional mindset and to provide the greatest ridership within
our resources.



RTD takes all proposed changes seriously, understanding the effects they have on
people’s lives.

RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

RTD is weighing options for keeping current service levels versus making temporary service reductions to
align with the current number of operators. Please review the options below and indicate the option you
prefer.
Option 1: Keep the current service levels. The frequency of trips would remain the same as it is now, but
on-time performance and reliability would vary each day. Notifications of cancelled trips may not always be
sent in advance.
Option 2: Implement a temporary service reduction which would reduce the number of bus and train trips
each day to offer riders greater reliability and on-time performance.

Project is to purchase various in‐plant vehicles and equipment through 2025. The
type of equipment being replaced includes but is not limited to electric carts, street
sweepers, snow blowers, forklifts, tractors, mowers, etc.
Our current frame pulling machine is now obsolete. The company we purchased it
from is no longer in business and we can no longer find safe replacement parts. The
machine is also very dangerous to use, and no longer is meeting our needs to
straighten the frames on buses. The replacement machine is a safer and more
accurate means of straightening vehicle frames. This machine is needed to help us
fix accident vehicles and get them back on the street in as timely a fashion as
possible. This is a critical piece of equipment for body shop repairs that must be
replaced.
We currently have 1 Gerber machine that is "old" and outdated, and 2 plotters that
are continually needing repairs throughout the year and have for the past 4 years.
These machines print/cut decals for bus signage throughout the District, e.g., safety
signage, interior/exterior bus signage, park‐n‐ride signage, bus stop signage, and
much more. We have three fabricators and only two machines. The third fabricator
was hired due to our heavy workload; we need the third machine to keep up with
our workload and to do our job effectively. The current machines are in poor shape
due to heavy use and require continual maintenance.

Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management System (CRM)

Location
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)

Project Description
TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition,
the current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re‐engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the Distrct.

Real‐Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS‐RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS‐RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

Mariposa Light Rail Division Recent cyber security audits from DHS and Parsons identified several deficiencies in
the Supervisory Controls Environment (SCE) security environment. Currently, there is
no Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) within the SNE or
authentication of switch access control to the SCE domain. Additionally, a two‐layer
Remote Access architecture is required since the SCE gateway is directly to the
Internet. The Supervisory Controls Department is requesting funding to purchase
software and hardware technology to support SIEM, RADIUS, and Remote Access
functions within the SCE. The target technologies are the QRadar SIEM, HP RADIUS
server, and Bomgar RAS server. These technologies will address 100% of the
information security issues identified in the cyber security audits.

Standard Security Architecture for
Supervisory Controls (SC SSA)

Mariposa Light Rail Division The existing Supervisory Controls Network (SCN) has limited cyber security features
both in the Mariposa Computer Center and Communication Houses. The SCN
enables the Light Rail OCC to operate and manage the Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) fleet
from within the Mariposa OCC. The Supervisory Controls (SC) department has
adopted a Standard Security Architecture used in Industrial Controls environments to
security critical controls from unauthorized access and comply with recent cyber
security audits from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Parsons
Security. The SC SSA establishes a high level of network compartmentalization and
integrates multi‐layer security technology within the SCN to minimize propagation of
Malware and unauthorized access. Specifically, the SC SSA compartmentalizes the
core computing environment (Mariposa Computer Room) and the extended
networks (Comm Houses) to establish firewalled gateways within and between
corridors to reduce network‐wide Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS). The SC SSA also allows for secured communication with the RTD IT
environment to share Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) and alignment data between systems.
The SC SSA will address approximately 70% of the cyber security issues identified in
the recent audits.

Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal
and external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software,
we will avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create
efficiencies that would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more
proactive. The added functionality of a new system would result in improved
communication and assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical
claim histories on bodily injury and property claims which can be a red flag for
potentially fraudulent claims. SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security
Committee is dedicated to improving the safety of employees and the general public.
Enabling an automated and hands free compilation of claims data in our enterprise
data warehouse or other software employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the
Committee with facts and trends on which to focus safety measures to reduce
injuries.

The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted
to operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator
fails to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a
predetermined grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a
complete stop. The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and
hardware for all of our current LRV fleet and the additional LRVs on order.
Additionally the project funds would provide for new signal software for each of our
existing corridors that currently have Automatic Train Stop (ATS) functionality.

existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under
an EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should
a large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re‐purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department
contracted police. The current view room would be converted into a large
conference and training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the
IT Division for continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

Central Rail Line

This project will include all of the downtown track and infrastructure from 7th Street
to 30th and Downing. This alignment is 25 years old and has been in service since
inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its potential lifespan.
There are several projects in place to make repairs and replace the worst of the
defects but an overall plan is needed to replace all track, turnout switches, street
crossings, concrete flat work, etc. This is a six year plan. The alignment will be divided
into segments that can be completely refurbished within the span of one
construction season.
The Central Corridor is over 24 years old. For the most part this infrastructure has
reached its potential life span. This repair project will replace existing rail, switches,
concrete flatwork and items associated with the existing rail alignment which have
deteriorated over the past 24 years. The work will be broken down into zones based
on the priority of conditions of the rail and location. All work will include
coordination with City and County of Denver (CCD), traffic control, and public
information (bulletins, radio and TV announcements).

Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH
119 Corridor to connect Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the
recommendation of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that
approximately half of the total costs for this project would be grant‐funded. The
establishment of BRT in the corridor would raise ridership from approximately 1,900
to approximately 5,000 daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and
design will be established through environmental clearance and preliminary
engineering ahead of construction. The project is anticipated to take two years to

The business case is to enhance the existing Mobile Ticketing fare collection system
to a full account‐based ticketing platform. In order to do this, RTD will need to
purchase and install validators on all bus and rail cars, enable the Account‐Based
Ticketing features in the Mobile Ticketing platform and convert existing card based
smart card accounts to account‐based smart card accounts. Expected to be
completed by January 2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M.
RTD anticipates receiving a grant for $1.8M. RTD will provide a local match of $1.8M.

Project Description
The existing Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) is model ST80 and does not meet current
credit card security standards which is one of RTD s greatest security vulnerabilities.
The TVM should have P2PE, EMV and meet PCI‐DSS. P2PE is a point‐to‐point
encryption solution which is a combination of secure devices, applications and
processes that encrypt data from the point of transaction to the bank. EMV stands
for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. These three companies developed the chip
reader technology for secure transactions. Companies that don t use EMV will take
responsibility for fraudulent transactions. EMV (chip and pin) is a service that is
visible to our customers and they have come to know, expect, and associate with
modern security. PCI‐DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard,
which sets the requirements for organizations and sellers to safely and securely
accept, store, process, and transmit cardholder data during credit card transaction to
prevent fraud and data breaches. Scheidt & Bachmann (S&B) has proposed an
upgrade to the ST80 TVM because they are out of PCI‐DSS compliance so the
operating system needs to be upgraded to Windows 10 in order to work with the
FareGo back‐end. This is a request for $2,800,000 to be spent by 2022 on an open
procurement to replace all ST80 TVMs and the backend system. With this plan all of
the old TVMs will have P2PE, EMV and meet PCI‐DSS by the fall of 2022.

FlexPass Program

Blake Street Office

RTD offers to its riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The
FlexPass program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for
RTD as well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to
overall customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to
choose their service level, vary passes from month‐to‐month, and enter or leave the
program at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to
participate including a pre‐tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5
million in annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March
2010, RTD contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in‐house in the near
future. Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for in the immediate
Smart Card plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020.
Historically this program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no
longer available.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000
in Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on‐going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up‐to‐the‐minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web‐based interface that allows staff to create
and manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts
System will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in
seconds. At the same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting
the specific route, branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect,
and by what channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website,
General Transit Feed Specification real‐time feeds and third party apps) the alerts
should be disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate
appropriate messages for all the dissemination channels.

Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management System (CRM) +

Location
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)

Project Description
TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition,
the current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re‐engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the district.

This project will implement a District‐wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in‐house. As
part of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM
tools, which could include externally hosted systems or software‐as‐a‐service (SaaS)
systems instead of in‐house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost
structure of the project and future staffing levels will change.

Smart Media Technology System has been operational since January 2013. Since
going live, the system has not received a refresh of the server and database
operating system. A system infrastructure upgrade, for 50 servers, is required to
maintain PCI compliance.
Project is to purchase and continually fund a suite of equipment, software and
cybersecurity specialist consulting services designed to identify security and
compliance gaps in our IT systems, remediate those gaps, and monitor for and
respond to suspicious activity in a timely manner. Assessment and mitigation
requires specialized skill sets and separation of duties (from RTD systems specialists)
which are more cost‐effective and operationally effective to outsource at this time;
additional equipment and services are needed to achieve compliance and security
goals such as network separation, threat monitoring, and asset discovery.

Real‐Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS‐RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS‐RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

The business case is to enhance the existing Mobile Ticketing fare collection system
to a full account‐based ticketing platform. In order to do this, RTD will need to
purchase and install validators on all bus and rail cars, enable the Account‐Based
Ticketing features in the Mobile Ticketing platform and convert existing card based
smart card accounts to account‐based smart card accounts. Expected to be
completed by January 2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M.
RTD anticipates receiving a grant for $1.8M. RTD will provide a local match of $1.8M.

Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal
and external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software,
we will avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create
efficiencies that would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more
proactive. The added functionality of a new system would result in improved
communication and assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical
claim histories on bodily injury and property claims which can be a red flag for
potentially fraudulent claims. SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security
Committee is dedicated to improving the safety of employees and the general public.
Enabling an automated and hands free compilation of claims data in our enterprise
data warehouse or other software employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the
Committee with facts and trends on which to focus safety measures to reduce
injuries.

Required by FTA 673, the Safety Management System is a tool to efficiently gather
and analyze safety data, which includes OJI (On The Job Injuries), and FTA and NDT
reportable events. Causal factors are required to be determined for each event.
Currently we use paper‐based and incomplete data collection, which is cumbersome
and inefficient.

RTD’s Rider Alert system was replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead Position rather than reporting
directly to the Senior Manager of Customer Care.

RTD was awarded grant funding from DRCOG to develop a regional wayfinding design
guide with a strong emphasis on multimodal connections and to develop a
universally legible wayfinding system connection to transit. This will improve first and
last mile connections to RTD services by standardizing wayfinding in the District and
making it easier to implement wayfinding systems in the future. RTD has committed
$25,000 in local match and Aurora and Denver has also committed a total of $25,000
in local match. The total project budget is $250,000 and RTD s local match of $25,000
(10% of the total project budget) will leverage $200,000 in DRCOG grant funding.

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under
an EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should
a large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re‐purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department
contracted police. The current view room would be converted into a large
conference and training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the
IT Division for continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.
