BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Budget Transfer Authorization for CAD/AVLRadio Purchase

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $483,000 of previously
approved capital funds to purchase twenty-on (21) CAD/AVL - radio kits for expansion buses.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
aging 2000 Orion forty foot heavy duty transit fleet.
We recently determined that the District needs thirty (30) more forty foot heavy duty transit buses than
we had planned for. The additional vehicles are needed due to changes in schedules and routes that
have resulted in a shortage in this type of vehicle. This shortage has put a strain on service delivery due
to a reduced spare ratio and it has also limited our ability to properly maintain our fleet.
As a stopgap measure we have opted to retain thirty (30) of the Orion’s until replacements are acquired.
This creates the need for twenty-one (21) complete CAD/AVL - radio kits since the original plan was to
retire all of the Orion’s.
We expect to replace these buses in 2016 but since this is an increase in the planned fleet size we have
a need to purchase twenty (21) complete CAD/AVL - radio kits to keep these buses in service. The radio
kits will be transferred to the replacement vehicles when they arrive in 2016.
DISCUSSION
We retired nine buses that were previously used in Longmont. These buses were all equipped with
CAD/AVL radio systems. This reduced the number of radio kits need for the thirty (30) buses being
retained by nine (9) which reduced the required number of radio kits to twenty-one (21). All of our buses
need to be equipped with the CAD/AVL radio system in order for us to keep track of the vehicles and
provide on-time performance data.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total dollars being transferred is $483,000. No additional funds are being requested so there is no
impact on the budget. It is a net zero transfer.
DBE PARTICIPATION
Since this is a financial transaction only DBE requirements do not need to be considered.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to approve this transfer in order to
proceed with the purchase of the radio kits.
2. Do not authorize the transfer. This is not recommended because it will cause a delay in the
District’s ability to increase the number of buses in service which will impact service delivery.
