### B. Special Acknowledgement - General Manager Washington

Chair Sisk noted that Phil Washington has made a difference in RTD, Metro Denver, Colorado, and nationally by his very presence.  He said that the farewell gathering on Friday, April 10, 2015 was a wonderful tribute to Phil Washington as General Manager (GM)/CEO and as a person.  Chair Sisk said that Phil Washington’s remarks towards the end of the event expressed what RTD meant to him and what RTD must do to move forward.  Chair Sisk noted that Phil Washington was very generous as he never used the “I” pronoun; everything he talked about was “we”.  Phil Washington challenged staff to do better things moving forward and to continue to grow.  Chair Sisk added that because of Phil Washington, every staff member, stakeholder, and partner knew that they were part of the team.  Chair Sisk commented that it has been an honor for the Directors to have Phil Washington as the GM; the fact that Los Angeles Metro (Metro) saw in Phil Washington what RTD has known for years is a credit to Metro.  Chair Sisk finalized his remarks wishing Phil Washington nothing but the best for him and his family as they move to Los Angeles.

Chair Sisk read a proclamation signed by The Honorable John Hickenlooper, Governor of the State of Colorado.  The proclamation declared April 14, 2015 as “Phil Washington Day”.  Chair Sisk presented Phil Washington with a framed artwork of Denver Union Station on behalf of the Board of Directors.

Phil Washington thanked Chair Sisk, the Directors and staff.  He said that since he started as GM in 2009 RTD has done many things infrastructure wise.  He remembers sitting at his first Senior Leadership Team (SLT) meeting and nothing being under construction.  Phil Washington recalled saying that if everyone came together and put their differences aside we could accomplish a lot.  He said the turning point to move forward was introducing the project managers to the mayors during a Metro Mayor Caucus meeting.

Phil Washington added that the 5 openings next year will be a big deal.  However, the biggest accomplishment has been taking care of the employees.  He saw that as his biggest commitment.  During his time as GM, RTD started the Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX), the Leadership Academy, the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program and the Veteran’s Luncheon.  He said that there is a clear succession plan, employees are praised and disciplined when appropriate, and an entrepreneurial culture has been established.  He believes the RTD staff is the best in the country enabling RTD to do great things.  He reminded the RTD leadership that the agency’s greatest asset is the employees, with no distinction between salaried or represented.  There is an unprecedented 5 year union contract and no strikes, which he added is unheard of.  He said that the best is yet to come for RTD.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, presented to Phil Washington, on behalf of the SLT, a framed artwork that included a picture of Denver Union Station before construction and another as it stands today.  Scott Reed thanked Phil Washington for his leadership and for all he has done for the Region and the nation.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked Phil Washington for all he has done for RTD.  She wished him blessings upon him and his family and Godspeed in his new adventure.

#### 1. Budget Transfer Authorization for CAD/AVL-Radio Purchase

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $483,000 of previously approved capital funds to purchase twenty-on (21) CAD/AVL - radio kits for expansion buses.

Motion:                Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the April 21, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, noted that the agency is in the process of receiving 30 new buses for its operations.  All the buses will need to be equipped with the CAD/AVL equipment.  Nine CAD/AVL kits will be repurposed from the retired Longmont buses.  The remaining 21 kits will be funded by the requested budget transfer.  While the agency waits for the new buses, 30 (thirty) 2000 Series Orion buses that were set to be retired will be used to bridge the gap.  These buses need to be equipped with the system.  He noted the action has no financial impact as the funds are available in the capital fund.

Director Folska asked for confirmation that the stop announcements on buses are part of the CAD/AVL system.  Bruce Abel confirmed that the Audible Stop Announcement Program(ASA) is part of the CAD/AVL system.  Director Folska expressed her concern due to the recent outage in which the ASA system stopped working.  She asked staff to ensure the ASA system is fully operational on the new kits.

Director Lubow asked what happened to the 2000 Series Orion buses.  Bruce Abel said that RTD still had them as they were not retired yet.  Director Lubow wondered if we will still need the new buses.  Bruce Abel replied that the agency is already in the process of receiving the buses.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. Fare Study Update April 14, 2015

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager.  Bruce Abel noted that the original Fare Study timeline had an optimistic deadline of April, 2015 for a recommendation.  After the public comment portion of the timeline it seemed like the most realistic timeframe for the recommendation would be May, 2015.  Bruce Abel emphasized that the public comment period reinforced the complexity of the project.  Staff would like to share with the Director the competing interests,  pros and cons of the many approaches.  He reminded the Directors that 16 public meetings were held, one in each District including a second meeting at the RTD Administrative Offices.  Bruce Abel noted that the staff will present a more comprehensive look into the Fare Study results during the April Study Session in order to have a more robust conversation.

Lacy Bell reviewed the presentation included in the Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda packet for April 14, 2015.  The presentation included an overview of staff’s initial proposal, a summary of the public outreach participation, a highlight of the themes from the public feedback process and next steps for staff, including a summary of feedback for the April Study session.

Bruce Abel brought to the Director’s attention the overarching public concern of the general economic malaise.  He asked the Directors to consider what RTD’s role is in addressing these types of issues.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, added that as the Board considers policy implications, the Board also needs to see the broader context of revenue and quantity/quality of service.  Bruce Abel noted that this is the exact type of tradeoffs that will need to be discussed during the Study Session.

Committee Chair Anderson asked the Directors to bring their questions on the Fare Study Update to the Study Session scheduled for April 28, 2015.
