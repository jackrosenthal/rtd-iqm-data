Commuter Rail Vehicles

1.D.1.a

• Why is testing a full year?
– Each commuter rail car needs 1,000 hours of “burn-in” before revenue service
– Each operator needs approximately 160 hours of “throttle time” (operating the car)
along the alignment they’ll work on before they can operate in revenue service
– The FRA and FTA have full oversight and require significant inspections and safety
checks before operations

• April: First commuter rail cars went through clearance testing from Union
Station to DIA; first test under power along the Pena Boulevard corridor
successful and will continue as part of the testing and commissioning
• May: testing of at-grade crossings from Ulster to Chambers to begin; after
successful testing, trains will begin to run through those intersections
• About a month before scheduled revenue service begins, DTO will do a
full revenue service simulation to ensure RTD’s performance standards
will be met

Safety Outreach Program

1.D.1.a

• RTD is assisting local agencies with the issuance of the letter
of intent; it will be sent to reviewing agencies this month and
will be followed by a 60-day review period
• A number of stakeholders have requested that the Quiet Zones
be established prior to revenue service; RTD and DTO are
working to fulfill that request, but it cannot be guaranteed at
this time
• Horns will always be blown if there are maintenance workers
or there is an emergency (car/pedestrian in right of way, for
example) on the track
• A collaborative public outreach plan with RTD and the
jurisdictions is being developed now in preparation for the
establishment of the Quiet Zones
