Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves an increase to the contract with RTD’s mobile ticketing vendor, Masabi (contract #16DH050),
to a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) value from $1,450,000 to $9,733,400. Funding for project expenses have
already been approved and are budgeted. Commissions and fees are paid directly from associated sales
in mobile tickets.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
2020 Strategic Priority #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
2021 Strategic Priority #4 – Increase Ridership and Improve Rider Experience (Implement Account-Based
Ticketing System)
BACKGROUND
Mobile Ticketing Program Success Story
RTD has three mobile app sales channels which allow customers to purchase fare products for bus and
rail; the RTD branded app (launched Nov 2017), Uber app (launched May 2019), and Transit app
(launched Sept 2019). Full fare, senior, individual with disabilities discount, and youth discount 3-hour
pass, day pass, and monthly passes, as well as, LiVE discount 3-hour and day passes are sold in all
three mobile app sales channels. All mobile tickets sold in the Uber app and Transit app cost the same as
they do in the RTD branded mobile app. 13.8% of the fare revenue generated January through March
2020 is from the mobile ticketing sales channel (all 3 apps combined). Since inception, RTD has sold
4,959,081 tickets in the RTD branded app, 60,713 tickets in the Uber app, and 25,359 tickets in the
Transit app for a total of 5,045,153 mobile tickets valued at $31,070,635.75.
The mobile ticketing sales channel has been wildly successful. Sales have exceeded several other sales
channels and fare media offerings. In January 2018, mobile ticketing sales exceeded MyRide stored
value sales, in December 2018,they exceeded paper 10-ride ticket book sales, in December 2019, they
exceeded farebox sales, and in January 2020, they exceeded ticket vending machine sales.

DISCUSSION
Account-Based Fare Collection System
Electronic Fare Operations resources and efforts are focused on launching the new Account-Based Fare
Collection System to replace the current, antiquated card-based fare collection system from Conduent.
The $3.8M grant received from DRCOG, in 2019, will be used to purchase validators in a competitive
procurement. The new Account-Based Fare Collection System will consist of turning on the AccountBased Ticketing (ABT) feature on the existing Masabi mobile ticketing platform and connecting the new
validators to the Masabi mobile ticketing platform. The Account-Based Ticketing feature allows smart
cards and other media (such as a student id or a contactless bank card) to be used as fare media.
Implementation will be conducted in a phased approach.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) Contract Amendment / Increase Contract Not-to-Exceed (NTE) Value
Due to the success of the mobile ticketing sales channel resulting in higher than expected sales and
associated commissions/fees, upcoming work on the Account-Based Fare Collection System, and
potential Federal Grant award costs, the team requests an increase in the Masabi contract NTE value
from $1,450,000 to $9,733,400 (an additional $8,283,200).Note – Past fees were covered in the
board-approved budgets and budget amendments for each year.
This new additional NTE amount consists of the following breakdown areas and costs:

Contract Item Description

Estimated Additional Cost

Details

$926,000

Due to higher than expected
demand for mobile ticketing,
sales were higher than projected
and resulted in higher
commissions/fees.

Past Costs
Additional Mobile Ticketing
Commissions/Fees Spent Up to June
2019.

Note - This amount includes
credit/debit card processing
fees.
Future Costs
Estimated Future Mobile Ticketing
Commissions/Fees for the Remainder
of the Contract Term.

$4,624,000

Higher than projected
commission and fees due to the
high demand for mobile ticketing
and an adjustment to the
contract term.
It is in RTD’s best interest to
pay the commissions and fees
for the on-going mobile ticketing
contract, short of discontinuing
the sales channel, which is not
advisable.
Note - This amount includes
credit/debit card processing
fees.

related to the addition of the
new ABT features in January
2022.
Mobile Ticketing Enhancement –
Vendor Portal

$102,000

There will be updates through
2023 to the Masabi platform
including Vendor Portal, which
enables RTD sales outlets to sell
mobile tickets and stored value.
Built into this costs are
implementation costs, licensing
fees, and commission.

AIM Grant Award Costs

$860,400

RTD undertook an application
for the AIM federal grant, which
if awarded will incur a cash
match paid to the FTA from our
mobile ticketing project, and will
also require us to disburse
payments to Masabi and other
vendors for their participation.
This is a one-time cost.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2020 attached.
The U.S. economy and consumer spending slowed during the second quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus
outbreak caused tremendous human and economic hardships. The U.S. unemployment rate peaked
above 14% during the quarter and then declined to 11.1% by the end of June. The continuation of
social distancing in response to the coronavirus outbreak continued to depress economic activity and
long term interest rates although credit spreads have begun to narrow.
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate to
0.00 to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects to “maintain this target range until it is
confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum
employment and price stability goals.” This drastic reduction in short term interest rates is now directly
impacting returns on RTD’s financial investments.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of June was 0.52%. Investment income
year to date was $2.9 million.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

In addition to the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s portfolio, all other reserves are
invested in accordance with state law and additional guiding documents such as bond indentures,
and escrow agreements. The following graphs reflect characteristics of all RTD investments
excluding unrestricted cash and equivalents.

Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded a
photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two weeks
of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide the
required photo or information are notified by mail.

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of June 30, 2020, 9,831 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 6,084 have been
approved, 3,013 have been denied, 729 are pending and the remaining 5 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,013 denied, 1,665 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 461 were denied because their address was out of
District, 65 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 52 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 608 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 162 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
729 pending applications, 680 lack an uploaded photo and 49 are pending for eligibility determination by
a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for LiVE.
Approximately 500 applications were approved in July 2020.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June, and 110 in July.
The 6,084 LiVE participants enrolled as of June 30, 2020, provided a mailing address 1 in the following
counties: Denver 2,979, Arapahoe 1,375, Jefferson 708, Adams 560, Boulder 265, Douglas 69, Weld
24, and Broomfield 23. Note that some counties are only partially in the RTD District. 81 participants
reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing address in a county outside of the District, which is
acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through June 2020, we issued 490 LiVE MyRide cards
that were used for 11,400 trips. 2,240 mobile app users bought 26,500 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 121,300 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.

RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19

situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.
