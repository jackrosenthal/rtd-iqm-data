Annual Budget is developed as well as parameters within which financial activities are performed.
Proposed changes to the Fiscal Policy are recommended to the Board to address current and emerging
issues, including those that result from regulatory, compliance, legislative, audit, Board-directed, fiscal
sustainability, best practices or other requisite sources.
During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting held on September 9, 2025, staff presented a 2026
Fiscal Policy discussion item that provided initial proposed modifications for Board consideration.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Recommended Action is to approve the recommended modifications to the Fiscal
Policy for 2026.
Changes in this draft 2026 Fiscal Policy include only minor grammatical and punctuation edits.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Recommended Action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Investment Policy

October 14, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
October 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2026 Investment Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year, staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming fiscal year in accordance
with Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by §24-75-601.1, Colorado
Revised Statutes, this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic Priority
of Financial Success.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors on
October 22, 2024, for the 2025 fiscal year.
During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting held on September 9, 2025, staff presented a 2026
Investment Policy discussion item that provided initial proposed modifications for Board consideration.
DISCUSSION
Changes in this draft 2026 Investment Policy include:
1) Changing the requirement of including an annual listing of investments held and investment
returns within the Q4 investment report rather than in the Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report (ACFR) according to RTD practice, as staff sees this as too much detail to include in the
ACFR

Packet Pg. 51

16.B

2) Adding the following titles to the list of persons authorized to transact investment business on
behalf of RTD to align with organizational roles: Director of Treasury and Manager of Debt and
Investments
3) Minor grammatical and punctuation edits
Changes have also been reviewed by legal counsel. No other changes have been identified at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Recommended Action.

2026 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of
the Regional Transportation District (RTD).

2. SCOPE
This investment policy applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer

•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
that might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard
to ensure that according to Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 15-1-304:
“In acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing
property for the benefit of others, fiduciaries shall be required to have in mind the
responsibilities which are attached to such offices and the size, nature, and needs of the
estates entrusted to their care and shall exercise the judgment and care, under the
circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence
exercise in the management of the property of another, not in regard to speculation but
in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well
as the probable safety of capital."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall

Packet Pg. 54

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy Proposed (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:

16.B.a

Subject: 2026 Investment Policy
Page 3

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD has authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 32-9-119.
Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the General
Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest

Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

16.B.a

Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any material
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes, or various technical
impediments, leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1,
Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded
below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will
review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such
holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit, and Bankers’ Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds, or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100% of
the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities. Obligations, participations, or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality, or United States governmentsponsored enterprise as described in Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 24-75-601.1(1)(b)

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will outperform the original investment.

agreements.

16.B.a

Subject: 2026 Investment Policy
Page 8

RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers
in the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD, and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD, or an investment advisor hired by RTD, will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services, and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and Custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements discussed below, all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third-party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP
number, and any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody

16.B.a

Subject: 2026 Investment Policy
Page 9

For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian, provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has a perfected interest in the securities used as collateral and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Q4
investment report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.
The current Board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion
of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and five years and with a target duration
of one year), the designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury
Note Index.

20265 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of
the Regional Transportation District (RTD).

2. SCOPE
This investment policy applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the

•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which that might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity
diversification and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard
to insure ensure that according to Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 15-1-304:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
lawIn acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing
property for the benefit of others, fiduciaries shall be required to have in mind the
responsibilities which are attached to such offices and the size, nature, and needs of the
estates entrusted to their care and shall exercise the judgment and care, under the
circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence

of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:

16.B.b

Subject: 20265 Investment Policy
Page 3

RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the
sale of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislativehas authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Sections 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated
to the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.

4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any material
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes, or various technical
impediments, leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1,
Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded
below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will
review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such
holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the
date of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit, and Banker's’ Acceptances.

16.B.b

Subject: 20265 Investment Policy
Page 8

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers
in the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD, and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD, or an investment advisor hired by RTD, will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services, and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Subject: 20265 Investment Policy

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third third-party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP
number, and any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody
institutions shall provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in
account, including book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian, provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has a perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial ReportQ4 investment report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Legislative and Government Relations Program

October 23, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
October 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2026 Legislative and Government Relations Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative and Government Relations Program. The Board of Directors approved the agency’s first
Legislative and Government Relations Program in October 2021. The Legislative and Government
Relations Program is considered by the Board annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff and external advocates to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative and Government Relations Program serves as an organizing
document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Boardadopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative and Government Relations Program are
designed to make lives better through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to
the region’s local, state, and federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be
proactive in education and inform the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities
available to advance shared goals. Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits
within the framework of RTD’s financial forecast. The 2026 Legislative and Government Relations
Program, included as Attachment A to this Board report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues
that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While legislation can have financial impacts on RTD, there is no financial impact associated with the
Board’s approval of this document.

2026 Legislative and Government Relations Program
PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2026 legislative
session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner with
the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly delegation,
and local elected officials to advocate for Board approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of Commerce, and
other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and seek
support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Specifically included within this strategy is staff’s
collaboration with the Board of Directors to utilize relationships to advance policies. Lastly, tactics
included in the Legislative Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s
Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2026 Legislative
and Government Relations Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative
matters are likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented to the
Board as part of the Board Executive Committee or another Committee deemed appropriate by the
General Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized for a
Committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation in question.

BACKGROUND
Originally known as the FasTracks Advisory Committee, the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) was
established by the Board in 2004 when it referred the FasTracks measure to the ballot for voter
approval. The CAC has had different responsibilities since its creation and has undergone updates and
changes in the last twenty years, the most recent of which occurred on May 29, 2024 when the Board
approved the CAC’s Charter. The Charter sets forth the CAC’s role and membership parameters.
Broadly, the CAC exists to provide the Board and RTD feedback on general matters relating to RTD’s
system of public transit. The CAC can have up to 17 members who serve staggered three-year terms.
Members are selected based on a host of criteria including demonstrated interest in transit,

Packet Pg. 88

16.D

membership in civic organizations, and community service. Additionally, the CAC should resemble a
broad cross-section of RTD’s district and include members from various geographic and demographic
backgrounds.
In most instances, CAC members are initially appointed to a three-year term and may be reappointed
for one additional three-year term. The Board last made appointments to the CAC in December of 2024
when it appointed six new members and reappointed two members. These were the first
appointments/reappointments made to the CAC since 2021. Moving forward, the Board aims to
appoint/reappoint between five and six CAC members annually.
For the 2025 appointment cycle, the Board Office opened the application for CAC members on Monday
August 4th and closed it on Friday, September 5th. The Board Office worked with Communications and
Community Engagement, current RTD Directors, and the CAC to promote the application. A total of 41
applications were received, which was a 20% increase over the prior application cycle. Applications
came from every Director District in the RTD except Director Districts H and I.
The nominating committee comprised of Director Ian Harwick, Director Chris Nicholson, CAC Co-Chair
Byrn Grunwald, CAC member Joe Meyer, and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll reviewed the
applications, met to discuss the application pool, and is making the recommendations for appointment
contained herein.
All current CAC members with initial terms expiring at the end of 2025 were solicited for their interest in
returning to the CAC for a subsequent three-year term. Ursula “Bryn” Grunwald and Eric Smith both
expressed an interest in returning to the CAC and are likewise recommended for reappointment given
their engagement and service to the CAC during their initial terms. The current membership of the CAC
can be found online at: https://www.rtd-denver.com/about-rtd/board-of-directors/citizens-advisorycommittee.
The membership selection process and criteria for selection are defined on page two of the CAC’s
Board-approved charter, which is attached to this item.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to review, discuss, and act upon the slate of recommended appointments and
reappointments to the CAC.
Short bios for those recommended for appointment are below:

For the Board of Directors to take the following actions related to membership on the Independent
Audit Committee:
• Reappoint External Member Jim Brendel to a three-year term commencing January 1, 2026

REPRESENTATIVES

PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board adopted the Internal Audit Committee Charter on October 25, 2022, made initial
appointments to the Independent Audit Committee (Committee) on November 15, 2022, and authorized
subsequent appointments and reappointments in both December 2023 and December 2024. Because
terms on the Committee are staggered, it is anticipated that the Board will make
appointments/reappointments to the Board on an annual basis. To that end, the Board is expected to
appoint two current Directors later this year to the Committee to succeed former Directors Dishell and
Peggy Catlin on the Committee. That action item is expected to come forward during the Board’s
November meeting cycle.
The Committee is comprised of three RTD Board members and two external members with expertise in
the audit profession. The Committee’s Charter establishes that Board members shall serve on the
Committee for two-year staggered terms and external members will serve two- or three-year terms
overlapping election years. In order to be eligible to serve on the Committee, Directors must have
served on the Board of Directors for at least one year.

Should this action be approved the membership of the Committee will be as follows through the end of
2025:

The aforementioned forthcoming appointments of two subsequent Directors to fill the seats currently
held by former Directors Catlin and Dishell will take effect on January 1, 2026.
*Director Catlin has resigned from the Board effective October 15, 2025. However, she has expressed
an interest to remain on the Committee. Per the Committee’s charter, Directors who depart the Board of
Directors prior to their term on the Committee expiring are eligible to seek the Board’s approval to
serve up to one year of their remaining audit term. Former Director Catlin’s successor on the
Committee is expected to be appointed later this year.
**Director Dishell resigned from the Board effective November 17, 2024. However, he expressed an
interest to remain on the Committee and was eligible, per the Committee’s charter, to continue to serve
on the Committee for a period of up to one year. His eligibility to serve on the Committee ends on
November 17, 2025. Former Director Dishell’s successor on the Committee is expected to be appointed
later this year.
***Mr. Brendel’s current term is expiring on December 31, 2025. Because he has both indicated a
desire to remain on the Committee and served admirably, it is recommended that the Board reappoint
Mr. Brendel for a subsequent three-year term. This mirrors the process to reappoint Directors Catlin
and Dishell to the Committee in 2023 to terms expiring in 2025 as well as the process in 2024 to
reappoint John Olenberger to a subsequent two-year term expiring in 2026.
DISCUSSION
Both former Director Catlin and Mr. Brendel have served on the Committee since its inception in 2023.
Mr. Brendel is a retired CPA and former accounting firm partner with over 40 years of experience in
auditing, consulting, and firm leadership. He continues to advise organizations through board and
committee roles, including with Dietrich Partners and Colorado State University. Mr. Brendel is
currently serving as the Vice Chair of the Committee.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Director Expense Allocation Reductions for Fiscal Year 2026

October 23, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
October 28, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board to adopt the attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2025, concerning a reduction of
Directors’ expense allocations in Fiscal Year 2026.

REPRESENTATIVES
Julien Bouquet, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for expenses to be covered by the agency for the agency to provide
reimbursement for reasonable local and travel expenses incurred that are necessary to the transaction
of official RTD business. Additionally, each Director has an allocation to cover registration fees for
conferences and other educational opportunities to support their service on the Board.
The Board has acted many times over the years to limit its expense allocations and did so three times
in 2021 and 2020. These actions limited Director expense allocations in 2020, 2021, and 2022, and
specifically limited allocations for Directors local, travel, and conference registration funds. These
actions were taken by the Board in response to broader economic headwinds facing the agency.
Per the Board’s Expense and Reimbursement Policy, Directors are currently afforded the following
expense allocations on an annual basis:
• Local expense allocation: $4,000
• Travel expense allocation: $6,000
• Conference registration: $1,800
DISCUSSION
For fiscal year 2026 only, the attached resolution:
• Reduces the Local expense/reimburse allocation by $1,000 to an amount not to exceed $3,000
per Director

17.G

•

•
•

Reduces the Travel expense/reimburse allocation by $3,000 to an amount not to exceed $3,000
per Director, effectively providing each Director with no more than $6,000 in combined Travel
and Local allocations for fiscal year 2026.
Explicitly reminds Directors of their ability to move funds between Local and Travel allocations
Reduces each Director’s conference registration fees by $800 to an amount not to exceed $1,000
Caveats that if favorable economic factors allow, the Board may choose to reinstate funding at a
later date, by way of a budget adjustment in 2026, to allow Directors to restore their expense
allocations for local, travel, and conference registration to the limits indicated in the Board’s
Expense and Reimbursement Policy.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the resolution would result in an estimated $72,000 savings to the agency’s General Fund
during fiscal year 2026. This amount represents a roughly 40% reduction in the local, travel, and
conference related allocations for Directors.

RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy
Page 3

The Regional Transportation District Act, specifically in sections 32-9-114 (d) and 32-9-117, establishes the
authority for reimbursement of necessary expenses pertaining to the activities of the District. The following policy
is intended to give guidance and set limits on expenses and allowable reimbursements for members of the RTD
Board of Directors. The Board has directed the agency to provide these funds to Directors only for conducting
official RTD business.
1.0.

General Policy

Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable expenses incurred that are necessary to
the transaction of official District business. Each Director must exercise sound judgment when incurring and
submitting for reimbursement such expenses, in keeping within the standards and proprieties of an agency
supported by public tax dollars. These funds are not intended to be used in a discretionary way for special projects
or initiatives undertaken by individual Directors.
Each Director’s annual limit for allowable expenses and reimbursements is as follows:
Travel Expense and Local Expense
Conferences

IT Expenses for
Monthly
Internet/Phone*

$6000

$1680

$4000
*The Chair may
access up to an
additional $1500

Out of District
Conference
Registration
Fees
$1800.00

*IT expenses eligible for reimbursement are outlined in Section 5.0, Business Communications.
The expense limits outlined above may not be exceeded but for the following exceptions:
• Under direction from the Chair, the Board Office may transfer funds between a Director’s Travel and Local
accounts to cover allowable expenses incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the Director.
• The Chair may utilize funds from the Chair’s account to pay for another Director’s travel or local expenses.
Directors who do not meet their limit for expense reimbursement may not transfer unused portions to another
director. Any unused portions will not roll over to the next fiscal year and Directors are not eligible to be issued an
RTD Procurement Card (P-Card).
The Board of Directors may choose to periodically limit by way of resolution the amount annually allocated to the
Directors’ expense accounts as the economy and the fiscal sustainability of the District dictate.
The Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District has taken formal action to delegate authorization
for travel necessary to the transaction of official business, within budget limitations, as follows:
• The Chair may authorize business, conference, and training travel, including associated expenses for
Directors.
• The allowable reimbursable expenses contained in this document are detailed in Section 2.0, Reimbursable
Expenses.

Introduction

17.G.b

The Chair may choose to deny a request from a Director for travel not covered by this policy, refer the request to
the Executive Committee, or both. The Chair may refer any travel or reimbursement request to the Executive
Committee without the Chair’s prior determination on the request.
A Director whose request for travel has been denied by the Chair or the Executive Committee may appeal for
reconsideration of the denial by the full Board. Unless the travel request is subsequently approved, the Board
Office cannot make further travel arrangements related to the denied trip. A Director is not eligible for
reimbursement for the cost of any unapproved travel costs or arrangements booked by the Director.
The Chair must deny the travel request of any Director who has expended or will have expended prior to the trip
all funds from the Director’s travel budget, unless the Chair elects to authorize the Board Office to pay for the
Director’s travel expenses using supplemental funds.
The Board of Directors may not incur expenses to any RTD department (except Board Office) or non-department
budget code. All incurred travel related-expenses eligible for reimbursement by a Director must be charged to the
Director’s travel Budget.
For local, transit-related events sponsored by RTD, a Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary
expenses incurred by the Director, and a guest, The expenses of the Director and the Director’s guest, are paid
from the Director’s local expense fund. (Resolution 002, Series of 2019).
While the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission has ruled that Article XXIX of the State Constitution (also
referred to as Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in government does not specifically apply to the RTD Board,
the recommendation from RTD’s General Counsel is for Directors to refrain from accepting anything of greater
than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends, as an exercise of their official
duties, an event for which the expected value of attendance exceeds $75.00, is responsible for the cost of their
attendance. Directors may submit itemized receipts for reimbursement, or the Board Office can make arrangements
prior to the event and charge the cost to the Director’s local expenses.

o Event sponsorship fees
o Office supplies
o Town hall or other special meeting supplies and refreshments
o Meals
o Books and reference materials
o Printing costs
o Organization membership dues (example: Accelerate Colorado)

To protect the interest of the District and to provide guidelines for the Directors to follow, the following provisions
govern allowances for out of town and local business-related expenses within established budget limits.
Only business expenses may be claimed. And, in order to be eligible for reimbursement for an ordinary and
necessary RTD business related expense, the Director must submit a proper itemized receipt showing the cost,
time, date, business purpose, and the name and title of any qualifying attendee, if applicable. An
ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field of trade, business, or profession. Political
meetings, partisan conferences, or political group activities cannot be covered as an RTD expense.
If meetings between multiple Directors and either employees or business contacts result in a subsequent request
to reimburse for a meal, the meal costs are equally divided among the Directors attending and charged to each
Director’s local expense account accordingly. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for meals or event fees
incurred by guests except as described in Section 1.0, General Policy.
In the event that RTD purchases a table for an event for which not all seats are claimed by Directors and staff, a
Director may request additional seats on a first-come, first-served basis and may invite a guest at no cost to the
Director’s local expense account.
Any incidental local expenses submitted without a proper itemized receipt will only be reimbursed up to $10.00.
In-person Board and/or Committee Meetings are typically catered for the convenience of Directors. If a Director
chooses to have a meal ordered for them by the Board Office, the cost of the meal will be charged back to their
local account. If a Director chooses to purchase their own meal from a different vendor, the Director must provide
an itemized receipt in order to be reimbursed for the meal cost.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for expenses, such as meals, flights, hotels, etc., whether local or outof-District, for any non-RTD transit-related business. This includes expenses incurred by spouses, significant others,
guests, or dependents. In the event that a Director departs from an out-of-district event or conference earlier than
anticipated or stays longer than originally scheduled through the Board Office, the Director cannot be reimbursed
for meals or lodging fees for the full days missed due to early departure or additional days of expenses incurred
as a result of staying longer. For any additional airline fees or charges incurred as the result of a flight change due

The following expenses are not authorized for reimbursement: Personal expenses such as personal hygiene items,
magazines, in-room movies, in-flight movies, pre-boarding fees, laundry, childcare, pet care, etc.
• Trip insurance for flights and/or hotel
• Travel Insurance (note: all Directors receive Travel and Accident Insurance, which covers the Director
while traveling on district business.)
• Alcohol (reference RTD Drug and Alcohol policy)
The Chair has flexibility in approving Director expenses. If requested expenses do not fall within the expense
guidelines, the Chair may seek advice and recommendations from the Executive Committee. (As outlined in General
Policy 1.0.)
This policy is not designed to provide guidance on every conceivable expense reimbursement request, as such,
Directors are encouraged to seek advanced pre-approval for any potential expense which is not explicitly covered
elsewhere in this document.
3.0.

Travel Request Process

Travel arrangements for the RTD Directors are typically handled by the Board Office, and a travel authorization
must be received before travel. Directors should contact the office at least 30 days in advance and provide all
information needed to complete the airline and hotel accommodations. If a Director chooses to make their own
travel arrangements, all travel confirmations are to be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking for the
purpose of record keeping and expense tracking.
When requesting travel arrangements, Directors should provide the following information to the Board Office:
• Conference name
• Requested arrival and departure dates/times
• Preferred airline and frequent flyer number (if applicable)
• Any applicable discounts, credits or travel miles to be utilized
• Special considerations
Unless prior approval is obtained, the Board Office arranges Directors’ travel on the most economical fare for the
required journey and makes every effort to book the Directors their desired flights and host hotel accommodations.
The Board Office provides electronic travel confirmations to each Director with the flight and hotel confirmations,
transportation information, a copy of the event registration and agenda, and other pertinent travel materials.
Travel requests received less than seven business days before the scheduled trip are processed based on the most
current rates and availability.
If a Director cancels their scheduled trip, any airline, conference, or hotel cancellation penalties will be deducted
from their travel and/or conference registration fee account, as applicable.

RTD Board of Directors Expense and Reimbursement Policy
Page 7

Air transportation for travel to out-of-District conferences and events is typically arranged by the RTD Board Office.
Travel by indirect routes, or inclusion of side-trips for personal reasons, must be approved by the Chair.
Reimbursement for travel expenses in a host city is allowed one day before the start of a conference or one day
following scheduled conference events where travel scheduling provisions or same day flight times are not available
or convenient, such as when a Director would need to fly from Denver to Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive
in time for a conference with a start day of Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director to arrive in time
for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side trips (including hotel, food,
ground transportation, and parking).
If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that has been arranged directly by the Director, a copy
of the itinerary and ticket claiming reimbursement must be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking.
A Director is responsible for any first-class, business class, and pro-rata boarding expenses.
If not purchased simultaneously with the airline ticket, a Director will be reimbursed for costs associated with both
a standard seat selection and checked and/or carry-on bags.
Directors who wish to track their frequent flyer miles (if applicable) must provide the Board Office with the frequent
flyer number at the time of the booking. The Board Office requests this information in advance, but it is the sole
responsibility of the Director to ensure his or her account has been credited with the frequent flyer mileage
information.
All air transportation credits paid for by RTD are to be utilized in the booking of future Director travel only and are
not for personal use.
4.1.2. Ground Transportation
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual expense of ground transportation necessary to conduct
official business. As a representative for the transit agency, Directors are expected to utilize the most efficient,
timely, and cost-effective ground transportation when traveling locally or out of town, namely public transit,
complimentary shuttlebus service provided by a hotel or conference, transportation network company such as
UBER or LYFT, taxi, or rental car, in this order of preference. If a Director pays for the transportation of other
Directors or staff, all names are to be documented on the receipt and expense report for reimbursement.
4.1.3. Car Rental
Car rental expenses are permitted only with prior approval of the RTD Board Chair and only when another means
of transportation is not feasible. Rental car arrangements should be made by the Board Office staff. Travel between
the airport and the hotel or conference center by rental car or other means are eligible for reimbursement with
receipts provided that the Chair has authorized the rental.
The rental car should be contracted for a size appropriate for the number of passengers. The Director must include
a copy of the rental contract when submitting the expense report. Reasonable parking fees for rental cars may be
claimed for reimbursement. (Note: travelers must ensure that adequate insurance coverage is in place by
purchasing optional insurance coverage as part of the rental agreement and, cars are to be refueled before

4.1.4. Personal Vehicles and Travel Outside the District Other Than by Air
The use of personal vehicles outside of the District is not encouraged. Directors must have the Chair’s approval
prior to using a personal vehicle for official business outside the boundaries of the District.
If approved, the mileage reimbursement for out of district travel cannot exceed a reasonable flight cost to and
from the destination.
4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The standard vehicle mileage allowance is determined annually by the Internal Revenue Service.
All mileage incurred, including to and from the airport for local events and/or travel, by a Director is paid through
the appropriate expense cost code to the Director on all submitted expense forms.
Director’s expense accounts will cover the first 30 miles of mileage reimbursement per event. Any mileage that
exceeds 30 miles will be charged to a Board Office expense account for mileage differential.
4.2.

Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)

The Board Office typically books lodging accommodations via P-Card for each Director attending an out-of-District
event. In the event these fees are not pre-paid, the Director must submit a copy of the official hotel bill with the
expense report when claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for hotel accommodations in
accordance with acceptable standards for that location. For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked
until the attendee is registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a timely manner
they wish to attend a conference, otherwise the conference hotel could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for purpose of incidental
expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover room, tax, and any other destination/mandatory fees
(if applicable). Upon check in, Directors will need to provide the front desk with their own personal credit cards for
miscellaneous expenses. When checking out, Directors are advised to check that their personal credit cards were
not charged for room and tax.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room charges, taxes, and fees.
Directors who are unable or unwilling to stay at the conference host hotel, should adhere, whenever possible, to
recommended GSA nightly lodging rates.
*Note: For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the hotel may place a hold on
the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
4.3.

Per Diem for Meals and Incidental Travel Expenses

Directors traveling out of district on official RTD business will be reimbursed a daily per diem amount according to
the current federal Continental United States (CONUS) published reimbursement rates to be used for the cost of
meals or other incidental travel expenses including housekeeping, tips, snacks, drinks, etc. There is no need for a

Director to submit receipts for these items in their travel reimbursement request as they will receive the CONUS
per diem rate by travel location for each day of business travel, therefore, it is within the Director’s discretion to
determine the usage of this amount. This per diem reimbursement amount will be adjusted regularly in accordance
with the General Services Administration federal CONUS reimbursement rate.
Directors cannot be reimbursed for any day(s) that they may choose to go early or stay late for personal reasons.
(See Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.)
4.4.

In State Travel Out of District

Directors travelling within the state but outside the District to attend seminars, conferences, or transit-related
meetings are eligible for reimbursement for travel expenses. Covered expenses include registration fees, lodging,
standard mileage, and Per Diem. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for lodging expenses without the
prior approval of the Chair. For additional information regarding in state travel see section 4.1.4 Personal Vehicles
and Travel outside the District other than Air.
5.0.

Business Communications (cell phone, internet)

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for a home office setup package from their local expense account. Eligible
equipment includes high-speed internet equipment such as a cable modem and router, and printer. The Director
is responsible for selection, use, ownership, loss, and replacement of all equipment after initial reimbursement by
the District. Directors may opt to purchase the equipment or utilize RTD-owned equipment. Equipment purchased
by Directors and reimbursed is considered RTD property.
Each Director, upon their request, will be provided an RTD issued and owned smart phone and a laptop/tablet.
RTD owned equipment is subject to RTD rules for the use and handling of agency-owned equipment, including but
not limited to policies governing the type of information permitted to be stored or accessed on the computer or
smart phone. All equipment provided or purchased with funds that were later reimbursed by the District remains
the property of the District and must be returned upon the Director’s departure from office.
In the alternative, Directors may use their existing equipment or may acquire their own equipment for use in
conducting their official duties. To be eligible for reimbursement for recurring IT expenses, a Director must submit
on a monthly basis a telephone and/or internet bill indicating the amount paid and location of the internet services
being provided. Monthly reimbursement claims that are not accompanied by supporting documentation are not
eligible for reimbursement. Monthly IT reimbursements are capped at $140.00 per Director.
6.0.

Out of District Conference Registrations

Registration fees for conferences, workshops, or other approved events are typically pre-paid directly by the Board
Office. In circumstances where a Director pays for their own registration fees, the Director is eligible for
reimbursement post travel/event and must submit with the expense report, when claiming reimbursement, a
receipt or proof of registration fee paid.
The Board cannot exceed its budget allocations for conferences, seminars, and other such events. Out-of-District
registration fees for each Director are charged to the Directors Conference Registration Fee budget. Local
registration fees are charged to the Directors’ local expense account.

In District Conferences/Seminars

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for expenditures or fees incurred while attending in district seminars,
technical meetings, or meetings related to professional development upon submittal of a local expense report along
with appropriate receipts. Such fees are charged to the Director’s local expense account.
7.0.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through active membership in
professional organizations. Although membership in professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as
an organization, the main benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast of
trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other professionals, and develop skills and
ideas to become more effective in their policy-making at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost
or that require approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed through the RTD Public
Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership requests through the Board office who will track and
coordinate with the RTD staff responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement. Membership requests that do not
fit this criterion must be approved through the General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational
Memberships was passed in August of 2011.
8.0.

Participation in Transit Related Community Events

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated with attending an event for
the Director and one guest, so long as the event is transit related. The expenses of the Director and one guest are
paid from the Director’s local expense fund.
Directors may sponsor a transit related community event with advance approval of the Chair. Any sponsorship
costs will be deducted from the Director’s local expense account.
9.0.

Participation in Community Non-Transit Related Events

Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with approval of the benefit to the
agency. Such events are essential in getting the community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times
the General Manager or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite Directors as
RTD ambassadors at no cost to the Director.
Any other approved events are paid for out of the Director’s local expense budget. Should a Director decide to
purchase a table for an event in the Director’s community with local expense funds, any unused seats are to be
paid for out of the Director’s local budget as well.
10.0. Ban on Political Expenditures
At no time can a Director’s expense funds or RTD funds be used for any event or expenditure that is political in
nature. For guidance on determining whether an event or expenditure is political in nature, Directors should
consult with RTD General Counsel.

11.1. Travel Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, a Director should submit a completed expense report to the Board Office no later than
the end of the month following the Director’s return to the District. (e.g., If the trip was taken in October, the
expense report is due no later than by November 30th). The Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend
the provision of travel arrangements for any Director who is delinquent in submitting an expense report. If extra
time is needed to complete the expense report or the Director has a valid reason for the delay, the Chair should
be notified to make the decision to extend this timeline.
The Board Office processes one travel expense report, post travel, for each Director traveling to an out-of-District
conference or event. In order to provide processing time for the staff to meet the deadline for submitting the
reports to the Chair, the Directors must include supporting documentation for expense reimbursement. Directors
should submit a completed expense report to the Board Office within two weeks after returning from a trip.
11.2. Local Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, in order to receive reimbursement for local expenses, a Director must submit a
completed monthly local expense report to the Board Office within 90 days of the date of the incurred expense.
In the months in which no expenses are incurred or in which the Director does not wish to claim any expense, the
Director must still submit a signed report for the reporting month with zero balance. The Board Office will process
one local expense report for each month a Director requests reimbursement.
11.3. Local Expense Report Processing Calendar
Directors will submit their local expense reports to the Board Office according to the following calendar. The
Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend the provision of reimbursement for any Director who is regularly
delinquent in submitting local expense reports.

upon request, a report of all expenses incurred by the Directors. The Board Office retains a record of all expenses
for audit purposes.

WHEREAS, each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues

cancellations both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel
within their districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside
of the state in the exercise of their duties; and

conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, due to projected revenue shortfalls in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, and Resolution 006, Series of 2020, which reduced the

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to amend the System Advertising Policy to prohibit commercial advertising
on any portion of the windows of revenue service vehicles, for advertising agreements entered into on
or after January 1, 2026.
And for staff to produce a report for the Board of Directors every 18 months after the start of the new
on-vehicle advertising contract staff on the status of the contract and make recommendations to the
Board on additional on-vehicle commercial advertising products and recommended changes to the
System Advertising Policy.

REPRESENTATIVES

Matt Larsen, Director (District E)
Chris Nicholson, Board Secretary and Director (District A)
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board has previously adopted and amended RTD’s System Advertising Policy (Policy). The Policy
establishes that RTD has defined space available to advertising (known as “RTD Advertising Space”),
sets forth the three clear uses of RTD Advertising Space (Commercial Advertising, RTD Advertising, and
Government Communication), and prohibits certain advertising content matter. The Board last acted on
the Policy in December of 2019, when the Policy was updated to better define RTD Advertising Space,
establish the aforementioned clear uses of RTD Advertising Space, allow for advertising on certain RTD
digital assets, and ban commercial advertising for cannabis and electronic cigarettes.
Official records indicate that the Board has been debating components of commercial advertising on
vehicles at least as far back as 1974. Over the years, the Board has grappled with whether to allow
commercial advertising on vehicles, where to allow commercial advertisements on vehicles, and the
content of those commercial advertisements. The Board has at various times taken actions to prohibit
certain types of commercial advertising content and to expand the available space on vehicles for

Packet Pg. 122

17.H

commercial advertising. Additionally, staff have negotiated commercial advertising contracts and
agreements which have expanded or shrunk available commercial advertising space. As such, the
current Policy of RTD is a mix of formal Board actions and contractual agreements negotiated by staff
and often approved by the Board.
Within the transit industry, there are many different types of on-vehicle commercial advertising
products that are sold which offer commercial advertising space on revenue service vehicles to
commercial advertisers. Several of those products offer the commercial advertiser advertising space
which covers various portions of vehicle windows. Colloquially, these advertisements are known as bus
wraps or transit wraps.
The agency currently allows for the covering of windows of vehicles in revenue service and sets
standards for these coverings, which define the following allowable window coverage. Those standards
are below:

▪

DISCUSSION
The Directors bringing this item forward initially requested a related discussion item for the September
30, 2025 Board meeting. At the September 30, 2025 meeting the Board tabled the item for further
discussion at the appropriate committee. On October 15, 2025, the Operations, Safety, and Security
Committee held discussions on the previously tabled item in which the sponsoring Directors sought
consensus as to whether to bring a related action item forward for the Board’s consideration. After that
discussion, the initiating Directors are submitting this item as a Recommended Action for the Board’s
consideration.
Because the application of commercial advertising on the outside of windows of RTD revenue service
vehicles may obscure customer’s outward visibility, the three Directors initiating this discussion find
that the practice of covering vehicle windows with commercial advertising has generated the following

Packet Pg. 123

17.H

negative impacts to individual customers: a decline in the overall customer experience and an increase
in customer safety and security concerns. Additionally, commercial advertisements on vehicles create
concern for the overall integrity of RTD’s brand and public image. Given these concerns, the initiating
Directors are proposing to ban commercial advertising on any portion of the windows of the agency’s
revenue service vehicles.
Further the initiating Directors are requesting staff to regularly update the Board on the status of any
future commercial advertising contract with those updates to include recommendations on both
additional allowable on-vehicle advertising space and any amendments to the Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board acted in June of 2025 to terminate the System Advertising Contract with Lamar effective
December 1, 2025, and the agency is currently in the process of selecting a successor vendor. In
anticipation of this action coming before the Board, staff requested proposers submit proposals with
and without window space being included in the allowable Advertising Space.
As part of the solicitation process, staff have made available historical revenue information. That
information indicates that during the six-month period from April 2025 to September 2025, gross
commercial advertising revenue was $1,851,530 and revenue generated from ads with some window
coverage accounted for $785,948.15, or 42% of the gross revenue.

RTD has space on the interior and exterior of RTD’s rolling stock, stations, buildings, facilities,
and properties, as well as on RTD owned electronic communication channels (website, social

services (“Commercial Advertising”); and

•

to provide information to the public by or about RTD, including information about RTD
transit services, programs, or products, including co-sponsorships with commercial or
governmental third parties that are intended by RTD to increase ridership or otherwise
support RTD’s mission (“RTD Advertising”); and

•

to provide public service information about federal, state and local government
programs and activities when requested specifically by federal, state and local entities,
including advertising from non-profit organizations that are partnering with such entities
(“Government Communications”).

Scope of Advertising Policy:

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ___, SERIES OF 2025
A RESOLUTION DIRECTING STAFF TO PLAN FOR HIGH-VOLUME EVENT SERVICE IN 2026
WHEREAS, the pandemic in 2020 forced the elimination of public events, concerts, large public
outside gatherings, and sports entertainment in large auditoriums to protect public health. This
resulted in a significant reduction or cancellation of RTD bus and rail service. While many
concerts and public sports events were reinstated in 2021, RTD has provided very limited
additional services to high-volume events; and
WHEREAS, the public invests in RTD to provide public transit services, alleviate traffic
congestion, and help reduce air pollution by decreasing the number of vehicles on our roads
and highways; and
WHEREAS, RTD’s service to major events including Denver Broncos games, Colorado Rockies
games, various concert venues, and other special community events better serve the customers
of the District, while decreasing traffic congestion and air pollution; and
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 2025-161 requires RTD to “work with entities hosting special events to
facilitate increased ridership to and from the events, so long as the facilitation of increased
ridership is additive to existing service”; and
WHEREAS, RTD staff indicated at the October 7th Study Session that they are pursuing “ticketas-fare” bundling and that a marketing and outreach strategy is being developed by staff to
collaborate with venues; and
WHEREAS, the Board understands the need for staff to have time for advanced planning to
ensure operational readiness;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation
District:
1. By February 24, 2026, staff shall prepare and present to the full Board a detailed plan for
additional dedicated transit service for high-volume events including home games of the
Denver Broncos, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, and Colorado Rockies as well as
University of Colorado Boulder Buffaloes home football games, Red Rocks concerts, the
BolderBoulder and other large concert or festival venues. There shall also be
consideration of the anticipated Burnham Yard sports and entertainment complex in the
future. The plan shall anticipate service beginning in May of 2026.

17.I.b

Packet Pg. 162

2. The plan shall include detailed staffing needs, requisite financial resources, fare structure,
estimated revenue generation, and the criteria for which a high-volume event is identified
for additional dedicated service.
3. The plan for service will be designed to maximize coverage of the entire RTD region by
utilizing strategic Park and Ride locations across the district to make it convenient for
customers to access the service.
4. These high-volume event services will be in addition to current service levels.
5. The plan will conform to all federal regulations and Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
requirements such as having at least one additional stop.
6. Staff will seek financial contributions from high-volume event venues, as well as
additional corporate sponsorship to offset the cost of providing additional services.
7. Staff will prepare a comprehensive marketing plan to advertise the introduction of these
services to inform potential customers that these additional services will be available.
8. Starting in March of 2026, staff will provide monthly updates and progress reports
regarding the implementation of these services to the Operations, Safety, and Security
Committee.
9. Should the plan require additional funding authorization from the Board and/or a budget
transfer, the Board will plan to take action to allocate the requisite funding in March of
2026 for service to begin in May 2026.
