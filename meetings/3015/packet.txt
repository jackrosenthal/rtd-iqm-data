2020 Operating Expense Adjustments
The district-wide operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment is
$733.2 million, which reflects a $6.6 million decrease from the 2020 Adopted Budget. This consists of
both increases and decreases to operating expenses as well as year-to-date budget transfers. These
changes result in a decrease of $10.3 million on the Base System, an increase of $1.2 million in
FasTracks Project, and an increase of $2.5 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $10.3 million net decrease for the Base System, budget reductions consist of previously approved
transfers to adjust budget line items and project budgets, intentional reductions by departments in
various line items, expense carryforward reductions, offset by necessary amended budget increases.
• Major reductions to the amended budget consist of $8.0 million in vacancy savings and furloughs
for represented and non-represented employees, $7.5 million in paratransit transportation and
fuel, $1.6 million in other outside services/projects, $1.5 million in Bus operator and overtime
wages, $1.4 million in contract maintenance, $1.3 million in purchased transportation contracts
and diesel fuel purchases, $0.7 million in security services, $0.6 million in software acquisition,
$0.5 million in special projects and public events, $0.5 million in self-insured claims, $0.4 million
in professional development funds and training, $0.4 million in management services, $0.3 million
in low value tools and equipment, $0.2 million in traction power, $0.2 million in oil, diesel
exhaust fluid and gasoline, $0.2 million in repair parts, and $0.2 million in travel.
• These reductions are offset by major increases of $6.2 million for lump sum contribution to the
represented pension plan (missed in the adopted budget), $4.8 million in represented fringes (not
budgeted appropriately in the adopted budget), $2.5 million in materials and supplies, $1.1 million
in contract maintenance, $0.7 million in management services, $0.5 million in LRT operator
overtime, $0.4 million in security services, and $0.3 million in low value tools and equipment.
For FasTracks Project, the $1.2 million increase consists of previously approved transfers, and $0.2
million in traction power, offset by reductions of $0.5 million in furloughs, $0.2 million in other outside
services, and adjustments for excess carryforward amounts in other outside services, management
services, and legal services.
For FasTracks Operations, the $2.5 million increase consists primarily of previously approved transfers,
$0.6 million in low value tools and equipment, $0.5 million in MOW repair parts, $0.5 million in other
outside services, $0.3 million in software maintenance, $0.3 million in professional training, and $0.2
million in represented fringes. The majority of the increases relate to the N Line. These increases are

offset by reductions primarily of $1.0 million in low value tools and equipment, $0.8 million in traction
power, $0.5 million in security services, $0.5 million in contract maintenance, $0.4 million in furloughs,
$0.3 million in other outside services, $0.3 million in legal services, $0.2 million in other materials and
supplies, and $0.2 million in repair parts.

In June of this year, staff presented to the Board projected cash flow scenarios for 2020. The Board
approved the worst case scenario to form the basis of the 2020 Amended Budget, which calls for
additional budget reductions above those that were initially submitted by departments. These initial
budget reductions were reviewed by the Board in May and are shown in the attached Exhibits A, B, and
C. The worst case cash flow scenario requires additional budget reductions of $7.425 million in order to
add a minimum $25.0 million to the unrestricted year-end fund balance at year-end 2020. Subsequent
reductions total $10.5 million, made up of:
Paratransit transportation*
Paratransit gasoline
Southwest Plaza Driver Relief Station (capital)
Self-insured claims
Launch marketing expenses
Total

$6.3 million
$1.3 million
$2.2 million
$0.5 million
$0.2 million
$10.5 million

*savings available due to reduced demand
The incremental budget reduction of $3.1 million plus updated forecast of grant revenue and other
income allow $34.7 million to be added to the unrestricted year-end fund balance, an increase of $9.6
million over the target $25.0 million.
Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will decline slightly by $74,000 from the Adopted
Budget. Debt principal payments will not change. On FasTracks, interest expense is will decline $1.3
million from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not change. These reductions in
interest expense are the result of two refinancings in late 2019 and early 2020. Interest can no longer
be capitalized during construction per a FASB rule. No new financing will be issued during the remainder
of 2020 for either Base System or FasTracks.

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.1

2020 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $98.5 million, consisting of $39.3
million for Base System and $59.2 million for FasTracks (Project). The combined increase over the 2020
Adopted Budget new capital is $58.8 million. These changes result from program changes that have
occurred since the 2020 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes for Base System result in a net increase of $0.5 million to new capital from the
Adopted Budget. Adjustments to new capital funding since the 2020 Adopted Budget include funding
for charging infrastructure for electric buses, roof replacement at Platte Division, rail replacement at
Central Corridor, Access-a-Ride cut-away buses, 40-ft. transit buses, account-based fare collection
system, Oracle ERP upgrade, rail substation PLC upgrade, and TVM replacements. Please see
Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
New capital changes for FasTracks result in a net increase of $58.3 million to new capital from the
Adopted Budget. This results from updated project schedules for current projects that changed the
projected expenditures in 2020 and changes in cost estimates (East Line, Gold Line, North Metro).
Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2020 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/19 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2020 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/19 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2019.
Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $450.5 million, a decrease of $123.2 million from
the 2020 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2019 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved project
transfers, project scope changes, deferrals to 2020, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward
amount, the Base System portion is $109.9 million and the FasTracks portion is $340.5 million. For
Base, major capital carryforward projects are the purchase of 40-ft. transit buses, purchase of LRVs,
16th Street Mall Paver Repair, Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project, Central Corridor rail replacement,
CAD/AVL ratio systems software, and Welton Street blank-out screens. For FasTracks, major capital
carryforward projects are North Metro, and close-out for East Corridor, SERE, Gold Line, R Line, and
DUS oversight. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $10.5 million on a combined basis from the
2020 Adopted Budget.

Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $163.8 million from the 2020 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School May 2020 forecast. The 2020 Amended Budget
incorporates the pessimistic forecast that represents a 24.0% decrease from 2019 sales/use tax
revenue. The 2020 Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds September 2019 baseline forecast which
called for a 2.0% increase over the then projected 2019 level. While it is customary to use the
baseline forecast in our budgets, it is believed the pessimistic forecast is appropriate in current
economic and pandemic conditions.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, federal grants, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to
increase $242.3 million from the amount in the 2020 Adopted Budget. On the Base System,
grant revenue is projected to increase $146.5 million from CARES Act funding, increase in 5339
Bus funding, offset by decreases in 5307 capital maintenance grants, 5337 fixed guideway
SOGR grants, FASTER grants, CMAQ grants, and carryforward grants. For FasTracks, grants are
budgeted to increase $95.8 million from CARES Act funding, an increase in New Starts, offset by
a lower carryforward amount.
o Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to decrease $37.8 million
due to reductions in project contributions on the Eagle project, offset by increases in thirdparty betterments on North Metro.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to decline in the 2020 Amended Budget for both Base System and
FasTracks. Fare revenue will decline because of pandemic service levels in March/April and
suspension of fares, and uncertainty about when ridership will resume in full in 2020. Fare
revenue is projected to fall to $93.8 million in the 2020 Amended Budget from $158.1 million
projected in the 2020 Adopted Budget, which is a decline of $64.3 million or 40.7%. Of revised
fare revenue, $65.7 million is attributed to the Base System and $28.1 million is attributed to
FasTracks (Operations).
Investment income is budgeted to decline by half from the 2020 Adopted Budget due to the
recent rapid decline in interest rates.
Other income is budgeted to remain unchanged from the 2020 Adopted Budget.

The revenue reduction to RTD from fare losses and the metro area’s decline in sales and use taxes
during pandemic stay-at-home orders are substantial. Much of the 2020 gap will be filled by emergency
appropriations from the U.S. Congress under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act passed earlier this spring. RTD is entitled to $232 million of CARES Act funding for 2020
on a reimbursement basis, intended to cover revenue losses and extra operating costs attributed to
keeping the system safe during the pandemic. Budget reductions in both operating and capital
expenditures have been made to meet the balanced budget mandate, assuming all $232 million in
federal funding is used.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $38.0 million from the
Adopted Budget to $55.5 million reflecting the funding sources and uses described above, amended
budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, and increases to reserves per fund balance policy.

FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $0.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
its purpose is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the FasTracks schedule without
requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The
FasTracks Internal Savings Account reserve fund is budgeted at $119.6 million, an increase of $16.1
million over the 2020 Adopted Budget from project underruns on FasTracks projects.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2020 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2020 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.

Date:

Subject:

COVID Budget Response Principles

Date: July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Buzek, Cook, and Guissinger that the Board of Directors adopt COVID
Budget Response Principles to guide and support the agency’s response to the financial shortfalls
occurring with the pandemic.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal 1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal 3 - Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
RTD, like all agencies, is faced with unprecedented and sweeping changes in its financial position
stemming from the outfall of the pandemic. It is possible, even probable, that the impact will be
longstanding, extending into 2021 and beyond. As a result, General Manager Paul Ballard has convened
the COVID Fiscal Response Task Force and charged that group with developing budget measures to
address these fiscal challenges.
In order to assure our ability to continue serving our riders and the region in the midst of significantly
reduced revenues, it’s critical that the board and agency leadership proceed with care and forethought,
operating from values and principles to appropriately guide decisions to come.
POLICY BASIS
RTD’s mission is to “Meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the district.”
Per the Board Governance Manual, “The Board’s role is a policy making governance board and sets the
strategic direction for the agency.” The Board appreciates staff’s efforts, and strategic and policy
guidance serves to support those efforts.
DISCUSSION
Discussions of the need for principles to guide the agency as it responds to declining revenues have
occurred during the Board workshop of June 4, 2020; in conjunction with a motion made in the June 9,
2020 Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee meeting; and at the Board meeting of June 16, 2020.

Packet Pg. 47

1.B.3

These discussions led to a Board request that a set of COVID budget reduction guiding principles be
brought forward for approval through the Finance, Administration & Audit committee to the Board of
Directors.
After consultation with staff and Board members, several individual Directors support the adoption of the
attached COVID Budget Response Principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt principles to support and guide staff development of budget responses to COVID-related
revenue shortfalls.
2. Do not adopt principles.

RTD COVID Budget Response Principles

Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe:
We will strive to keep our communities connected and our riders, employees and region
healthy and safe.
Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be creative:
We will take a balanced approach to budget reductions and do so in such a way as to align
with our mission. Accordingly, service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the
impact to our customers. We will strive for a well-rounded approach by incorporating
reductions in overhead, breaking down silos and engaging partners, and seeking creative
approaches to service delivery.
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit during the pandemic:
We will strive to maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most
depend upon our services to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping
our communities and activity centers appropriately connected.
We will support and value all of our employees.
We acknowledge our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the public
and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage categories, because a humane work environment is
valued by RTD.
Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and expertise:
We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to decision-making for the COVID period,
while planning for the mid-term financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through the Re-Imagine project,
the accountability committee, and stakeholders.
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input:
We will take active measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of CARES
Act money as well as in the decision-making process for measures we adopt to respond to
ongoing COVID financial impacts.

retreat and numerous discussions at the Executive Committee and Committee meetings.

INFORMATION
Each year the Board approves a multi-year budget plan called the Mid-Term Financial Plan. This plan
forecasts revenues and expenditures for planning purposes. The first year of the Mid-Term Financial
plan becomes the basis for the next year’s annual budget. RTD is currently working on the 2021-2026
Mid-Term Financial plan. This plan is being developed under very unique circumstances. RTD is dealing
with issues surrounding the COVID-19 virus.
This virus has severely impacted revenues and
expenditures as well as overall operations of RTD. In addition, RTD had embarked on a System
Optimization Plan which process has been modified to accommodate the current conditions.
BACKGROUND
On July 7th, the Board had a study session where Heather McKillop, CFO, discussed the challenges
ahead, revenues, and expenditures. Bruce Abel, Special Projects, discussed the internal COVID-19 task

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

&

GM
Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 87

1.D.1

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of June 30, 2020, 9,831 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 6,084 have been
approved, 3,013 have been denied, 729 are pending and the remaining 5 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,013 denied, 1,665 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 461 were denied because their address was out of
District, 65 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 52 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 608 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 162 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
729 pending applications, 680 lack an uploaded photo and 49 are pending for eligibility determination by
a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for LiVE.
We saw a significant drop in applications when the social distancing measures related to the COVID-19
pandemic went into effect. The number of approved applications per week decreased by 59% from an
average of 231 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 90 through the end of May.
New enrollment dropped again in June but went back to 95 in the last week of June, ahead of RTD
resuming fare collection. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation, we are seeing a higher percentage of
applicants who apply for LiVE at the same time as they apply for other benefit programs, or shortly
thereafter.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through May 2020, we issued 480 LiVE MyRide cards
that were used for 11,400 trips. 1,750 mobile app users bought 26,000 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 98,000 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many individual
riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to each client
depends on the organization and the client’s situation.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

•
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility

requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application outreach worker helping interested individuals apply
at rotating locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. RTD and
Denver Human Services have agreed to pursue this option.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19

situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone until the offices re-open.

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program. Production of the videos will start on July 8.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to develop and implement a temporary
LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in emergency situations will be able to
issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients after the PEAK application is completed. This
will eliminate the wait time between the LiVE application and the ability to use the
discounted tickets for these individuals.
Work with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.

Execute the amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an application outreach worker (the title will be “outreach
coordinator”). Denver Human Services will start the hiring process.
Create policies, procedures, and agreements for the temporary LiVE ID card described
above.
Finalize questions for the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program. We will ask for information about demographics and income level, application
experience, fare products, and suggestions for improvement.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.
