RTD Financial Administration & Audit Committee
SHELLEY COOK: Hi, everybody. I'll call to order the Financial, Administration, and Audit
Committee. The time we're convening is 8:59 PM. And I would respectfully ask that everybody
connected to this call just check that your phones are still muted and your ringers set to silent.
I will go ahead and recap that under the current circumstances, the official meetings of the RTD
Board of Directors are being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. So
during this time, meetings are primarily audio recorded. The audio recordings, along with the
unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as practicable on the Board's website.
OK. Moving into our agenda, pretty long one tonight. So I'll just go ahead into the recommended
action items.
So the first one we've seen before. And it's the approval of the 2020 amended budget. Just reading
the recommended action here, it's recommended by the Finance, Administration, and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors adopt resolution number-- I don't have that number yet-series of 2020 to amend and appropriate funds to the proposed 2020 budget, amended, to increase
the appropriation by $105.5 million to $1.338 billion and to decrease the appropriation of capital
carry forward-- previously approved capital funds is in parentheses there-- by $123.2 million to
$450.5 million, as detailed below in the discussion session of this Board report.
This action supports the following General Manager's goals. Core goal number three, strong
financial management, and task goal number one, fiscal sustainability. Do I have a motion?
JUDY LUBOW: So moved, Judy Lubow.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, Director Lubow, mover. And who was the seconder?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Malpiede.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Chair. All right. First of all, I ask Heather and/or Jannette if they'd like to
recap any changes that have been made since the Board last saw this item.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So Madam Chair, this is Heather McKillop, CFO. I'm going to ask
Jannette just to recap one item, which is on, one main item which is on packet page 192 regarding
the additional money that the Board asked us to find to be able to have a higher carry forward
balance.
So Jannette, if you could please do that, that would be great.

JANNETTE SCARPINO: Certainly. This is Jannette Scarpino. On the operating expense side, we
have worked to reach the cost reduction targets presented to the Board in June. And we have
identified all of the necessary reductions that we needed to make.
I want to make a note about the other cost reductions totaling $7.4 million. We haven't yet landed
on the $4 million in payroll savings we need on the represented side. And this item does need to
be finalized.
Also, if you could bear with me, I'd like talk, I'd like to highlight what's going on with the fund
balances. We have made some real strides here. And in the amended budget we're looking at a
Board appropriated fund of $42.-- I'm sorry, $42.2 million, capital replacement fund of just under
$16 million, an unrestricted operating reserve of $15 million, FISA of about $119 million, and our
unrestricted year-end fund balance of about $56 million, which is an increase of $38 million from
the adopted budget.
So our total fund balances, excluding the FISA, the total is $129 million. The base makes up $82.5
million of that. FasTracks at 47.3. And again, an overall increase of $38.6 million from the adopted
budget.
We are seeing a small increase in revenue, overall revenue, really only because of grant revenue,
and that, more specifically, the CARES Act funding. You all know that we brought in the
pessimistic projection for sales and use tax from the CU Leeds May forecast, which is a decline of
$164 million, or 25%. And our fare box revenue, we are showing a decline of $64 million, which
is an internal projection.
I have nothing else to say really, but happy to take questions.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. That was quite a bit of news.
So I'll go ahead go ahead and ask for questions or discussion, starting with Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: No questions this time.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: None at this time. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: I just wanted to confirm that the increase in the FISA contribution was due to
savings in the FasTracks capital program, is that the way I understood it to read?
JANNETTE SCARPINO: That is how the FISA-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is Jannette. That is
how the FISA is built, yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: So this is Heather McKillop, CFO. Yeah, so normally it's from the
incremental bus savings. But in that case, the additional amount was from savings in capital
projects.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Thank you, Heather. That's the way I read it. I was at first curious why the
increase, and then I saw it later in the document that it was due to FasTracks capital savings. So
thanks.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes, project closure closures mainly.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Folska?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Sorry. I forgot you were running the meeting, so I was waiting for you. No
questions, thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Nothing right now, thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: No, thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow?
JUDY LUBOW: No questions, thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Nothing.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No questions or comments at this time. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: No questions at this time. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Walker?
JEFF WALKER: Nothing for me. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Good work, Jannette and Heather. No questions for me. Thank you.

SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams?
KATE WILLIAMS: I guess I wore them all out. Good work keeping up with what's going on,
Jannette and Heather. Thank you. No questions.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't have any questions. I would just
like to say thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. Thank you very much. I'll second that, on the part of all the people
involved in making these modifications. Really appreciate the work and detailed effort that went
into this. And enjoy hearing the good news relative to what we had been considering.
So let's go ahead and get the vote going, if I may. I'll again go in alphabetical order. And please
say yes or no.
Director Broom, your vote?
BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lubow?
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten?

NATALIE MENTEN: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker?
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams? Director Williams? I'll come back to her. Chair RiveraMalpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And I'm a yes. Director Williams, are you there?
KATE WILLIAMS: Oh, thank you for that nice music break. I am here. I vote yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Is your vote a yes or a no, sorry?
KATE WILLIAM: It is a yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. Thank you very much. OK. Well, then the vote, the item passes
with a vote of 14 to 1, Director Menten being the no vote. So thank you.
With that, let's move along to the approval of a budget action for the Accountability Committee.
Let me read that.
So the recommended action is that the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee recommend
that the Board of Directors approve the following budget action transferring funds from the Board
Appropriated Fund to the Board Office in Other Outside Services. That's account number, I guess,
53039, to fund the Accountability Committee in the amount of $200,000.
Do I have a motion to approve?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved.

LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
SHELLEY COOK: Is that the Chair?
JUDY LUBOW: Second, Lubow.
SHELLEY COOK: And Director-- OK, I heard that Chair Rivera-Malpiede is the movant and
Director Guissinger is the seconder. So OK. Let's see, Heather McKillop, do have anything to add
on this item?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No, Madam Chair. This is Heather. I would just take any questions you
might have.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And Chair Rivera-Malpiede, or you or Director Guissinger have any
comments you'd like to add?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would like to refer this to Director Guissinger. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Not really. This is the number that was agreed on in the proposal this Board
unanimously passed. It's for the first year of activity, and then the proposal says something like the
parties would act in good faith, if the committee goes on further, to find other sources of funding.
Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you very much.
Well, first let's just open it up for any questions. And if you would just-- I'm anticipating there
won't be many. So rather than go around, I'd just like to ask if anybody has a question they'd like
to ask our staff or the two Board members who were most involved in this.
KATE WILLIAMS: This is Director Williams. I have a couple of questions.
SHELLEY COOK: Please, go ahead.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'd like to know, what's the budget for the ACPD?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So this is Heather McKillop, CFO.
SHELLEY COOK: Go ahead.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So we don't have a budget for the APCD.
KATE WILLIAMS: ACPD. IPCB. OK. And what's the budget for the APAC?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: We don't have one for that either.

KATE WILLIAMS: And how about for the Citizens Advisory Council. What's their budget?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: They don't have one either, except for the-KATE WILLIAMS: So this group gets $200,000, but the other committees that are made up of
people who are disabled and people who are citizens, we don't have any budget for them. But this
is a group that's made up of political appointees, and they get a budget of $200,000. Is that correct?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: That is the budget that has been requested, yes.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK. I just wanted to make sure that we got that on the record. Thank you,
Madam Chair. That's all I have.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you, Director Williams.
LYNN GUISSINGER: This is Director Guissinger. You know, I guess I would just say that it's
being hosted. This is an independent board. It's an independent committee. It's not an RTD
committee. And it's being hosted and facilitated by DRCOG. And I think the expectation is that
there's a pretty defined scope of work to look at a lot of RTD's financials and policies and things,
and that they would need consulting services. So hopefully, that helps.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes, thank you. Any other comments or questions?
OK. Let's go ahead and go around for the vote. And once again, I'll go in alphabetical order.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Chair?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes, go ahead.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Excuse me. Director Folska.
SHELLEY COOK: Sure. Go ahead, Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: So I'm a little bit confused why this committee needs to hire a consultant
when they themselves are supposed to be the best and the brightest in that particular area. And I
have to say, they're independent like everybody else. All these other committees are made up of
independent people that are experienced in a particular area. And I think Director William's point
is well taken.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. I appreciate the point of view. Anybody care to comment?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would like to comment on that. So when the Accountability
Committee was looked at, it was to be a collaboration between the governor's office, the legislature
transportation committee, and then to have an independent entity do facilitation. . And that
independent entity was DRCOG.

And DRCOG put together a scope of work with a dollar amount, and their dollar amount was
$200,000. And it broke down-- I think we had reported on this earlier. So it would be $100,000
for their staffing to oversee the coordination of all the meetings and all of those logistics. I think
was like $25,000 for meeting supplies-- there was just a bunch of stuff like that. And then the rest
was if they needed to bring specific people in to look at different things, with the DRCOG staff,
as they oversee this process. And it was for one year that we agreed that we would do that.
So I hope that helps a little bit. But Director Folska, if I remember correctly, you had brought up
the point about the amount of money, and it wasn't going to be just a blank check to this entity that
would be overseen but would have specific criteria assigned to it. And our staff has been working
diligently developing the process, the agenda, outlines, and all of those things. So we're really
keeping a tight look on all of that.
I hope that helps.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. Thank you, Chair.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well-SHELLEY COOK: Go ahead.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you, Chair.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska, go ahead.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you very much. I appreciate this.
You know, it is troubling. I don't mind the committee. I welcome it. I am deeply troubled by the
$200,000. It's well more than what any of us make. We spend hours and hours and hours doing
this job. It's more than what the legislature would make. I know they just got a pay raise. But I
can't support this. My vote is going to be no.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. We'll go around in a bit. I clearly misgauged the comment on this. Does
anybody else have any questions or comments they'd like to raise?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Hi. This is Director Lewis.
SHELLEY COOK: Who was that? Director Lubow?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lewis.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lewis, go ahead.

SHONTEL LEWIS: I just wanted to clarify a comment that was made by the Chair, but also
Director Guissinger made a conflicting comment. And so I just wanted to clarify. Director
Guissinger said this is a committee that's independent of RTD. And the Chair, Rivera-Malpiede,
just said that the agenda's are being created by RTD. And so I just wanted to clarify, is this being
led by RTD or is this being led as an independent committee? And if it's independent, why would
RTD staff be creating the agenda?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I'll jump in on that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, go ahead, Lynn.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think the first agenda and some of the other materials have gone around.
But they were created by DRCOG. They've been sending things over to staff. And I think the Chair
and I have seen them.
The budget is-- just to be clear, nobody is getting paid on this committee. You know, initially that
was a proposal in SB-151. But it's not a proposal to pay anyone. The number is-- it's the amount
that people would be billing against.
And I think this is more analogous to Reimagine and to some of our internal committees. Because
they have a specific scope of work of documents and people to talk to and things like that.
Reimagine has a much bigger budget for consultants and scope of work. It's a longer project, which
this is really a very small budget for the kind of work that they're going to be doing.
And I guess I would say that we passed, unanimously passed a proposal that said that RTD would
be paying this amount. So really, this is an issue of appropriating it from a specific account. But
we have already adopted this committee and approved that, in my opinion, approved that payment
at this point already.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you, Director Guissinger.
SHONTEL LEWIS: So Chair?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
JUDY LUBOW: This is Judy Lubow.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lubow, go ahead please.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I wasn't quite finished.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Judy. I really appreciate it.
JUDY LUBOW: Sure. Sure.

SHONTEL LEWIS: Thanks. So to be clear, Director Guissinger, you're saying that the agendas
are being prepared by DRCOG?
LYNN GUISSINGER: There's an initial draft agenda. The committee is supposed to be appointed
by tomorrow, according to that proposal, and it's supposed to be meeting before the end of July.
And I think that-- and I am not involved with this but I think the staff at DRCOG has created sort
of an initial meeting, just a single start it off, introduce everyone and talk about how they proceed.
But after that point, I think the one of the first tasks of the committee is to elect a chair and vice
chair, and they'll be taking over at that point, I assume.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK. That's helpful. I just would be concerned if we were utilizing staff time
and we were also appropriating these dollars for others to be able to do some of this work that, at
least as it reads in what we adopted. And so I just wanted to clarify that.
But to Director Williams' point, I think she brings up a very valid point. I think we see this
oftentimes in communities with disabilities, communities of color, low income communities is
they are often not compensated for their time. And I recognize that no one's going to be
compensated, at least according to what you have said earlier. But I appreciate you raising that,
Director Williams, because it is a valid one. And I always appreciate you looking from that lens
of equity. That's all.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow?
KATE WILLIAMS: Somebody's getting compensated. DRCOG is getting compensated. So
somebody's getting compensated for this.
SHELLEY COOK: Directors, before we go on to Director Lubow, if I may turn it over to Barbara
McManus, who had something to add to this. Go ahead, Barbara.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Can you hear me?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I just wanted to add, when the Chair was talking about agendas, so
there's an internal committee that is supporting this effort as well. So my staff and myself have
been working on putting together this group so that we can put together a backbone and a process
of how requested information will come to the agency, how it will be dispersed through the agency,
how and who we get it to once it's completed to move forward for evaluation to the committee.
So there's actually two separate groups going on. There's the Accountability Committee that will
be facilitated by DRCOG. But there is an internal committee, as well, that is going to be managing

what all of the asks from this committee are, much as we have been for the state audit. So I just
wanted to clarify that as well.
And then any of the staff that works on any of any of the process that's put in place, we have an
object code that we're coding our time to, so that at the end of this process we know what the
internal resources were needed to move this forward.
So just wanted to clarify to the Directors where some of the overlap was. So thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: I have a question for , Ms. McManus. I'm sorry Chair, I have a question. This
is Director Williams.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. If it's OK, I'm going to go around to the Board-KATE WILLIAMS: OK, I'll wait. Come back.
SHELLEY COOK: --just so that we [AUDIO OUT]. With regard to Director Lubow, my
apologies.
Director Broom, do you have any questions or comments here?
BOB BROOM: No, I don't. I think we've already agreed to do this. And so we're just wasting a lot
of time here tonight.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Ditto.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. I do believe that Director Williams brought up a valid point that
we already did agree to approve this committee, and that came along with the budget.
But can I ask a question? did anybody else just get put on music hold?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Because I couldn't hear what Barbara McManus had to say because I was
on music hold. OK. Thank you. I won't delay this discussion anymore.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Folska, any wrap up comments here?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No, thank you.

SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger, you also?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, Director Lewis, same thing? You pretty good?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I would like to know more about the internal committee. Because the price
tag is no longer $200,000 if we're also paying for staff time. And I think that's a really important
piece that this is the first time I've heard that in discussion. I agree with Director Broom. We have
agreed to this. But I know the financial aspects were missing the last time we had this discussion.
And that is important for me personally, as a Director.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Barbara McManus, may we trouble you to provide some information and
follow up to that question?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I would say that as AS the invoices come in against the $200,000 from
DRCOG, those will be reviewed by Directors Whitmore and Guissinger, since they are the folks
that will be attending these meetings, to verify that the funds are being appropriated correctly.
And then we will be reporting that to the Board intermittently. And what we can also do is there
is a report that can be run through finance that will track the staff time based on the code that we'll
be utilizing, and we'll be able to report where we are financially with staff time for this
Accountability Committee as well. Is that sufficient?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. And the other thing I'd urge Director Lewis, and anybody who's interested
in more of that in detail, would be to get with Ms. McManus as well afterwards.
And just thinking about our big agenda here tonight, and wanted to make sure everybody had a
chance to comment on this. So Director Lubow, so you-SHONTEL LEWIS: So just one-- this is Director Lewis here. Just one more quick comment,
because I just want to honor at least a conversation that I had with Barbara last week about staff
time, particularly pertains to the Board. And in the Board, staff being incredibly busy, and so I
would hate to put additional work onto our staff. And we are compensating [AUDIO OUT]
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, feedback, sorry. You there?
BARBARA MCMANUS: This is Barbara McManus. I just want to interject that once we hit the
four-hour mark on this meeting, you're going to be placed on-- you individually will be placed on
a musical hold for a short period of time. That's how this software is set up. So that is what is
happening right now. We're all pretty much hitting that four-hour mark. And so we're going to
have some intermittent interruptions. I apologize.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, that's good to know. Director Lubow are you on currently?

JUDY LUBOW: Yes, I am. And I just quickly want to say that I very much support this committee.
And I would pay more than $200,000 for what I hope will be the beneficial results from it, which
could be healing the rift between some of the public and stakeholders and RTD.
That's all. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: Yeah. I would want the price to be lower. But as others have said, we agreed to
it previously. And the price is what it is.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. Thank you. Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker?
JEFF WALKER: No comments. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: And Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: No comment. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And Director Williams, any wrap up comment? You've already-KATE WILLIAMS: I just have been on the record as being opposed to this from the get go. I don't
think that DRCOG has any oversight committee or the state Senate or the House of
Representatives. And I think that this is not the first oversight committee that RTD has.
So I've said before and I continue to assert I'm not opposed to this. I just think that what's good for
the goose should be good for the gander. And I think it's-- that's all I have to say. Thank you so
much for giving me a second bite of the apple. I will be a no vote.
SHELLEY COOK: My fault for having not gone around to begin with. And Chair RiveraMalpiede, do you have anything you'd like to add here at the end?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do not. Thank you, Madam Chair.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. For my part, I think the advantage of proposing this and being part of it
is that we did have a chance to be influential in terms of the scope of the committee's work and to
do things like cap this amount, which I think was an explicit effort on the part of the Chair.
So I just wanted to say, and I agree with Director Lubow, this presents an opportunity at a critical
time for the agency. So I agree with sort of seizing on that.
So let's go ahead and vote, if we can. I'll start from the top. Director Broom.

BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger. Director Guissinger. OK, she's on mute. Director
Lewis.
LYNN GUISSINGER: This is-- did you call me? This is Lynn.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I was on music hold. Sorry. I'm a yes vote.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lewis.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Could you tell me what the other votes were?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. So far, Director Broom, Buzek, Catlin are yeses. And Director Folska is
a no.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: You bet. Director Lewis? Director Lewis? We'll come back to you. Director
Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Tisdale.

DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: No.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Chair Rivera-Malpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lewis, are you back?
OK. That was me on music hold. Chair Rivera-Malpiede, did you say yes?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I did.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And I vote yes. Director Lewis, are you back? Director Lewis?
OK. Right at this moment, we have 2 no votes, 12 yes votes. Director Lewis? Director Lewis?
OK. I'm going to record her-- hopefully she'll come on here shortly. But got 13 ayes. Whoops,
sorry, 12 ayes. Director Lewis? Two no votes, and I guess we'll call it an abstention at this point.
So 13 yes votes, 2 no votes. That's Director Folska and Director Williams. And then one abstention.
Director Lewis, are you back?
OK, we'll leave it at that. That's our recorded vote. So thank you all. And again, my apologies for
having misgauged the comment and interest in talking about that one.
So moving on to the next item. It's the COVID budget response principles. Now this is Director
initiated. A number of people have been involved in this. But the three of us who are bringing it
forward are myself, Director Guissinger and Director Lubow. We've had a chance to talk about
this at multiple meetings. I wanted to acknowledge others who have been important in bringing it
forward, including Director Lubow and Director Lewis.
So do I have a motion at this point? The recommendation is by Directors Buzek, Cook, and
Guissinger that the Board of Directors adopt COVID-- excuse me for that typo-- adopt COVID
budget response principles to guide and support the agency's response to the financial shortfalls

occurring with the pandemic. And again, it's brought by Directors Buzek, Cook, and Guissinger.
Sorry for that mistake earlier.
So again, do I have a motion for-JUDY LUBOW: Is that the motion? Is that the motion?
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. It's recommended by Directors Buzek, Cook, and Guissinger that the
Board of Directors adopt COVID budget response principles that are attached to this item to guide
and support the agency's response to the financial shortfalls occurring with the pandemic. The
action supports the following general manager's goals, a core goal number one, successful delivery
of transit services, core goal number three, strong financial management.
Now I will say here that I know there's interest in making an amendment. And as soon as we have
a motion on the main part and a seconder, then we can take up any motions to amend. OK, Director
Lubow?
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: You bet. So do I have a motion to approve?
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek, so moved.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you. Director-LYNN GUISSINGER: Guissinger, second.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you very much.
OK. So just to expedite, I would, before we go around, I'd like to go ahead and take Director
Lubow's motion and take those up. She was kind enough to send through her recommended
changes. And I believe it's her interest in voting on them separately.
So what we will see is the first motion presented. Go ahead, Director Lewis, please present your
motion. I mean Director Lubow, sorry. Sorry about that.
JUDY LUBOW: [INTERPOSING VOICES]. I move to amend principal number four, we will
support and value all of our employees, by adding the following words, we acknowledge our
frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the public and who have borne the brunt
of mandating in the past.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.

JUDY LUBOW: You need a second.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes, we need a second. Do we have a second?
TROY WHITMORE: This is Whitmore. I'll second.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore, second. Director Lubow. Now this is a discussion on
the motion to amend. And just to repeat, the amendment proposed is to add a bullet note under
principle number four, we will support and by all of our employees, to read, we acknowledge our
frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the public and who have borne the brunt
of mandating in the past.
So with that, I'll go around to see if there are any questions or discussion about the motion. And
this time, I'll go in reverse order, just to try and even it out here.
JUDY LUBOW: Can I make a little statement?
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, sure, please. Yeah, go ahead. You bet.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah. And it's basically that I agree with the original principle that we will
support and value all of our employees. I mean, mom and apple pie, what's not to agree with? But
I think it's also important to state that there is a particular acknowledgment about the importance
of our frontline employees. Because they are the ones who directly promote our motion-- or excuse
me, our mission-- and they are the ones who have not only borne the brunt of mandating in the
past, but they've also borne the brunt of the pandemic for us.
And I feel that it is worthwhile not to make a determinative statement, but to make a statement of
value and acknowledgment that, yes, we agree that these people are important to us. That's all.
Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. OK. So going around from the reverse order, Director
Williams, do you have any comments or questions at this point on this motion to amend-KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I do not.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore, you're the seconder. Any comments?
TROY WHITMORE: No. I appreciate the spirit of the amendment. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Walker?
JEFF WALKER: Nothing for me. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Tisdale? Director Tisdale? Maybe he's on hold here.
DOUG TISDALE: Excuse me. Sorry. Yes, thank you. No comment.

SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Just a note that the one sentence that says, accordingly service reductions
should be minimized so as to minimize the impact to our customers makes me think back to the
very passionate speech that we heard about capital. And-SHELLEY COOK: If I could interrupt you, we're talking about the motion to amend right now
only. Can I ask you to hold that comment until we go to the main motion.
NATALIE MENTEN: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Yes, I would wait.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. And Director Lubow. Director Lewis, do you have any
comments or questions about this motion to amend?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I just have a question of clarity. The way you read it and the way that it was
written, at least via email when we received this afternoon, it's we acknowledge our frontline
operator employees. Is that-- that's how it's written. But it was-- that's not how it was read. And so
I just want to make sure I understand what we are voting on.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, thank you. I took out the word operator, because the frontline employees
are more than that.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Great. I support it. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't reading something
that didn't actually exist. I just wanted to clarify. Thank you so much for that.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Sorry, I apologize. But could I ask you to read it one more time as it is
now?
SHELLEY COOK: I'll read it. OK, she's moving to amend principal number four, which currently
reads, we will support and value all of our employees, and by adding the following words, it's
actually in bullet form, we acknowledge our frontline employees who directly promote our mission
to the public and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you. No comments.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Folska. Director Folska? I'll come back to her. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I prefer the statement that we value all of our
employees. But I understand that this is almost a parenthetical acknowledgment of our frontline
employees, of which there are many, not just our operators. So I guess I would say that I really

prefer it to be more general because I do value all of our employees and not-- well, let's just leave
it at that. But I will support the motion. I just wanted to make that statement for the record.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Buzek. Director Buzek? OK. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: No questions.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek here.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, Director Buzek, go ahead.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes. Sorry, I was on whatever that hold is, music hold. But no questions. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you much for letting us know you're back. Director Broom had no
questions. Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No question.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Director Folska here.
SHELLEY COOK: Who was that? Sorry.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Director Folska.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, you're back. Excellent. We were just going to cycle back to you. Do you
have any comments or questions?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yeah. I love what it says and I love the intent behind it. And I really
appreciate Director Lubow adding that amendment to it. I'm wondering, though, before-- I'll vote
yes on it. But I'm wondering if we could get some input from our general counsel on any
implications it may have in our future negotiations with, say, the union or anything like that. But
in general, I support this. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Melanie Snyder, are you joining to weigh in here?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yeah, sure, Madam Chair. You know, these are guiding principles. So that's
what they are. They're principles that are going to guide these decisions. So I don't see them as
having an impact specifically on those negotiations.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. And for my part, what I would say is recall that Director
Lubow circulated earlier wording that was a bit stronger. And I appreciate the fact that she's sort
of taken into account some of the comments that she may have, or discussion she may have had.

The word acknowledge is meant, I think, to recognize and to state that without lending special
treatment necessarily, but just to say we acknowledge our frontline operators. So I'm going to
support this one too. I want to stress that it's not meant to elevate a group. The principle still reads,
we support and value all of our employees.
OK. So with no other comment, let's go ahead and ask for the vote on this. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'm a yes vote. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lubow, of course, movant, is yes, correct?
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Catlin.

PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, and thank you. And thank you, Chair Cook, for articulating what I could
not articulate earlier. For that reason, I'm a yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Chair Rivera-Malpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And I'm a yes. So that's unanimous. Unanimously approved. Thank you.
OK. Director Lubow, your second motion. Please proceed.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, thank you. And thank you for being patient about this. I move to amend
principal four by adding the following words, we also acknowledge those full-time employees in
the lower wage categories because a humane work environment is valued by RTD.
SHELLEY COOK: So we've got a motion. Do I have a second? Do I have a second? Sorry.
KATE WILLIAMS: Williams, I'll second.
SHELLEY COOK: Who was that? I'm sorry, it was kind of muffled.
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Williams. I will second.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams. OK, great. So we-- motion to amend by Director Lubow
and a second by Director Williams. So let's go around, please, and take comment. And I'll start in
alphabetical order. Director Broom. Or Director Lewis, or not Lewis, Director Lubow, I should've
asked you if you wanted to comment on this one. Please go ahead.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes. Yes. And the reason that I am proposing this is that it expresses the value
that we care about employees, including the ones that are in the lower income categories. Because
it's obvious that they will be roiled deeper more by budgetary cuts than people with higher income.
And we care about it and we want to be of help if we can. So that's what this is about.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. So again, going around from alphabetical order. Director
Broom, do you have any comments or questions?
BOB BROOM: No comment or question.

SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I would just join some of your comments, and Director Catlin's comments
earlier, that we value all of our employees. But I'll probably be a yes vote on this. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. Director Lubow, I just want to tell you, I really appreciate the
spirit of this addition to this principle to acknowledge our full-time employees in lower wage
categories because a humane work environment is valued by RTD. And I'd like to offer a friendly
amendment, but I am trying to think about how to word this, particularly because I think as a
Board, I think many of us express the opportunity for us to not just acknowledge our lower wage
employees but to show them that we value and cared about them and that in that value that we
were creating a humane work environment.
And so I guess I'm just kind of having a tough time with this one in particular, because I don't
know what action, in terms of action how we apply this principle in a way that shows to employees
that we do indeed value them and acknowledge that they're lower wage earners, particularly as we
never-- our discussion around a tiered approach to furloughs never really went anywhere. And this
would have been a time to apply that, this principle.
And so I just-- I know I'm rambling. But I'm just having a hard time with this. And I'm not really
sure what to add to this. Because I do appreciate the spirit of this. I'm just not sure if I agree with
how it's worded. And so maybe just give me a few seconds to think more about that. But I
appreciate you bringing this forward.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. I think we can do one more level of motion to amend, but I need to consult
with Melanie Snyder on that. But for right now, if it's OK, I'll move on to Director Menten. Do
you have any question or comment?
NATALIE MENTEN: Well, I'll just comment that I think we did do something with the furloughs
below, what, $19 and change, they were not affected by the furloughs.
SHONTEL LEWIS: We didn't do that.

NATALIE MENTEN: I thought we did do that.
SHELLEY COOK: Pardon me. I don't want to get a lot of crosstalk. So Director Menten, we can
get the staff to respond to your question. Shall I do that here?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. CFO Heather McKillop, can you reinforce how we handled the furloughs
for the non-represented employees?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes. So anybody that made below a family of three for 185% of the
federal poverty level were exempted from that. So yes, we did do what Director Menten said.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. OK, go ahead, Director Menten, if you have comments to add to that.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah. So I think that was our official statement. And I don't know how I
feel about this amendment and how this may affect us going into the future. So I'll leave it at that
for now. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Direct Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Yeah. On similar lines, I don't see the need to classify the employees and how
much we value different wage ranges. So I'd be a no on this.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I don't know, I'm not going to oppose it.
And that's principally because in reading the language, we also acknowledge those full-time
employees-- well, of course, we acknowledge them, so I have no problem in saying that. And then
because a humane work environment is valued by RTD, how can I vote against that?
So by process of elimination, I say yes I will support inserting this language to the fourth boldfaced
paragraph.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. I'll just echo Director Tisdale's comments. I can't disagree with anything,
but I'm not sure that it adds much. I think the cut off that we had for furloughs is-- I'm sure that's
very much appreciated. I'm sure thank yous are appreciated. But this just doesn't move me. But I
can't vote against it. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. All right. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Well, I tend to agree with the last few Directors. I'm just lukewarm on this.
I guess I'm troubled with the term humane. I mean, you can't vote against that. But it seems like

it's a weak word in what we're trying to get to. But if we're dismissing at this hour, I don't think it's
too wise. So I'll have to think about that here in the next 20 to 40 seconds. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. Thank you. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes. I will be a vote on this. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You know, I feel the same way Director Lewis is talking about. I
understand the spirit of what's to be said. But for some reason, the way the words come together,
it feels not very good to me in my gut. So I'm going to have to think about this one. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you, Chair. And I'm of a similar mind, too, having trouble putting
my finger on exactly what. I was one who would have supported a tiered approach to the furloughs
as well. But even given that, I'm just not, I'm simply on the same wavelength as some of the other
folks expressing some unease or a little bit of concern about it, but not necessarily or maybe going
to oppose.
So let's return to Director Lewis. Did you want to make a motion or to suggest a friendly
amendment on that after you've had a chance to think about it?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah. I'm not really even sure what to propose. It's just, yeah. Actually, if it's
appropriate, I'd love to hear more, a little bit more from what Director Lubow, the intent of this
was, like what she was hoping to accomplish. Because it might help me find the words to
wordsmith it.
SHELLEY COOK: Or perhaps just to decide a vote. So go ahead, Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: You know, I, too, was in support and am in support of doing a tiered approach to
furloughs and other reductions, as long as it's legally appropriate, as long as we could, it's legally
viable. And I think that in my opinion, what this does is gives staff a nudge that we're interested
in looking at economic well-being as one of the things that we look at when we are evaluating
budget cuts.
So it doesn't say you have to look at that. But it's saying it's a good idea to look at it. And that's
how I envisioned it.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. That is helpful. Oh, go ahead, Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: No, please. Go ahead. I'm just going to wrap up otherwise. Please go ahead, if
you have any thoughts. Or we can go ahead with a vote.

SHONTEL LEWIS: I think your wording around the economic impact is important, and
understanding the intent is helpful for me. I'm happy for you to move forward with the vote. I
mean, again, I support the spirit. And I won't get hung up on words, because I do support the spirit.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. All right. So let's go ahead and proceed to a vote, if we can. Director
Broom, I'll start with you.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker.

JEFF WALKER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director-- or Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No.
SHELLEY COOK: And I'm no also. So let me count this real quickly. We've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10 yeses and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 nos. OK. So that passes 10-5, with the no votes being Director
Mihalik, Director Menten, Director Cook, and Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
JUDY LUBOW: All right. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: You bet. OK.
NATALIE MENTEN: One correction. One correction, I don't think you had Whitmore. This is
Menten. I'm sorry. I don't think you had Whitmore in there.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you very much. Director Whitmore is another no. So five nos,
Whitmore, Mihalik, Menten, Cook and Chair Rivera-Malpiede. OK. So that passes 10-5. Thank
you all very much.
We'll look into that.
And then let's move to the main motion. I'd like to go around and see if there are questions or
discussion about that as well. So starting with the back, for no particular reason. Director Williams,
do you have any questions about the main motion? This is to adopt the budget principles that are
attached to the items.
KATE WILLIAMS: No. [INTERPOSING VOICES]. I'm fine. I have no further comments.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: Excuse me. We don't have a third amendment proposed?
SHELLEY COOK: No. Are you wanting to make one?
TROY WHITMORE: Oh, goodness no.

SHELLEY COOK: OK. And those were the only two. I hope I didn't jump ahead of Director
Lubow. Am I correct on that?
JUDY LUBOW: That is absolutely correct.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. So Director Whitmore, any questions about the main motion, or
comments, et cetera?
TROY WHITMORE: No further comments. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Nothing for me, thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Nothing further, ma'am. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: You bet. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Same for me.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah. I will go back to where I started earlier. Seems to be a contradiction
within this document and the way that I look at it when we say, the paragraph, service reduction
should not be our primary response. Accordingly, service reductions should be minimized so as to
minimize the impact to our customers. Yet then through two paragraphs down from matter three,
that we're being data driven and informed by collective wisdom and expertise, da, da, da, including
through the Reimagine project.
And looking at our budget problems that are deeper than COVID, because we heard this November
last year when we pushed off doing a mid-term plan, I see these contradicting themselves and so
that I am not surprised when staff says, you know, we get messages all over the place and we don't
know sometimes what you're telling us to do.
And I see that contradiction within here. So those are my comments. At the end of it, I believe I
will be voting no on this, just because I don't think it makes a clear statement. So thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you for the comments. Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: I think you could go in the other direction.
SHELLEY COOK: I'm sorry. I shouldn't reverse. It confuses me. Director Lubow?

JUDY LUBOW: Oh, I'll be supporting this. And I really appreciate all the work that went into it.
And I think it reads very well. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Sorry?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I have no comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, OK, great. Thank you. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No comment. I'll be a yes vote. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No comment. I'll be a yes vote. So go ahead and skip me next time.
SHELLEY COOK: For the vote? I don't know. OK, Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: I appreciate Director Menten's comments about clear direction the staff and
giving them mixed messages. But I actually took that particular comment about service reductions,
that that should be the last resort and to look at other opportunities, such as overhead and other
expenses that we're incurring to avoid service reductions when possible.
So I do understand that this can be a little bit ambiguous. But overall I support that they are
principles and not policies. So I support the resolution. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you much. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No comment. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No comment.
SHELLEY COOK: And I just say, I agree with Director Catlin and reinforce the fact that these are
principles. And also, being data driven I think does, in some way, support the information and
bases for decision making that we saw brought forward by Mr. Cripps and so forth this evening.

So anyway, could say that, in that sense, they're not contradictory. They, in some ways, would
reinforce. So I'd like to go ahead with a vote, if I could quickly. And let's just start with Director
Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska, she wanted me to skip her.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I'm just trying to help make it move a little faster here.
SHELLEY COOK: Appreciate that. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes. yes
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lewis. Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: No.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.

SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. OK. And I'm a yes as well. So I show that as 13 to 2, with
the two opposed being Director Menten and Director Mihalik.
Thank you, everybody. I really sincerely mean that. I appreciate all the discussion that's led to it
and the sincere considerations of what we can use for our principles.
OK. So moving right along here. The next item is the General Manager's 2020 and 2021 core and
task goals. So let me get to that recommended action. It is recommended by the Financial,
Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised 2020 goals
and 2021 goals. And I look for a motion.
JUDY LUBOW: So moved. Lubow.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second, Catlin.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, Director Catlin was a second. And who was the primary?
JUDY LUBOW: Lubow.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, Director Lubow, OK. Thank you very much. All right. Motion by Director
Lubow, a second by Director Catlin. And I would like to turn it over to Director Catlin to introduce
and describe this item for us. Thank you. Go ahead, Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes. Just by way of history, the GMOC is working with a set of goals to try
and do a performance evaluation for Mr. Ballard. And we recognize that this is unique
circumstances in many ways. And not only is Mr. Ballard interim, but we're going to be hiring a
new Director within the next few months. His contract, however, says that we will evaluate him
quarterly.
With the advent of COVID, that kind of interrupted the first quarter evaluation. So we are moving
toward that now. Furthermore, the staff has been-- hello? Furthermore, the staff has been operating

on a set of goals, albeit not approved yet, for the first six months of the year and they would like
to move forward as practically as possible.
And the goals that were last approved were a year ago in July. And they were put forth in April
previous to that by the former General Manager. And they had very specific metrics tied to his
performance. And I think a number of us agreed, moving into 2020, that those were no longer
relevant for a number of reasons. So in our retreats in February and March, we looked at amending
those 2020 goals to better reflect conditions and those that could be achieved by staff and the
General Manager.
So we had put forth a number of agreed upon goals, mostly tasks goals, I have to say, that emerged
from the retreats. And those were memorialized in the document that staff submitted, probably in
the May timeframe, for consideration. And those documents were attached to the packet.
And recognizing that things are really changing with respect to COVID and how we respond, we
probably just need to have a benchmark right now with which we can move forward with the
agency, adopt some goals, and then recognize that for 2021 they may likely change again.
So I don't want to take much longer than I need to. But we did go through the trouble of reviewing
the detailed minutes from the SLT Board retreat to try and reflect some of the items that were
highlighted then that may not have been incorporated into the condensed version that we were
provided a couple months ago. And then we were looking at, there were a number of comments
that came forward, and I'll use Director Guissinger's as an example, that there were some concern
that there were not enough financial goals that were cited.
And so the attempt was to try and incorporate the core goals, which are more fundamental and
static, and look at those as they related to each of the task goals that were presented and see if they
could be incorporated into one document so that we could move forward.
So I mean, I'm happy to leave it at that and see if there are any questions.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. What I'd like to do is kind of follow suit from the last item. I think that
there are a couple of Directors who want to make motions to amend. And Director Guissinger has
circulated some text a while ago. And she's also Vice Chair of the Committee.
So I'll go ahead and see if she wants to make her motion to amend before we go around and talk
about the main motion, if we can do that again, please. Go ahead, Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you. This is, as Director Cook said, this was circulated a couple of
weeks ago. And it's in sort of, I guess I wrote these thinking that we would be redrafting. But as
Director Catlin said, the main goals came out of our retreat, so it made sense that didn't happen.
So they're a little disjointed.
But the point was that when we went through the goals for the COVID-19 and then the pre COVID19 that were needing some modifications, and then the 2020 pre COVID-19, and then the 2021,
that it didn't seem like there were financial goals that made sense, and it seemed like a-- and the

only one that had any financial task goals was the COVID response. And given our situation and
the fact that our staff and everybody else are working so much on financial goals, that seemed like
a glaring omission.
I sent these to Mr. Ballard and Ms. McKillop and asked them if they were OK with these. And
they said they were, that they were fine with these. I just would add these. I almost think of these
as sort of administrative but I'll just read them real quickly so they're in the record.
So my motion would be to amend the proposed 2020 and 2021 updated goals as follows. And I'll
stop there and just say that I did not amend the 2021 goals. I guess I was hoping we wouldn't pass
those. But I think that Director Catlin is right. Maybe we move forward with them with the idea
that they need to be reviewed as we move closer to 2021. So there's nothing in here for the 2021
goal.
So amend the proposed goals as follows. Under goals related to COVID-19 response, in the
financial section I would add a new bullet that says, make decisions that prepare for projected
deficits in 2021 while meeting the Board's COVID budget response principles.
And before the heading 2020 Strategic Priorities, also refer to task goals, insert the following
heading. It just says Goals Set pre COVID, with modifications. Under strategic priority one, I
would add a new bullet that says begin building partnerships with local governments, agencies,
and non-profits for seamless mobility options.
Under strategic priority number three, I'm just not going to even deal with that one, I think, to take
that out. Add a new strategic priority that says, strategic priority number six, move RTD towards
stable financial situation. But first bullet says, make decisions that prepare for projected deficits in
2021 while meeting the Board's COVID budget response principles. And second bullet says, enter
2021-- originally I had written it, enter 2021 with roughly a $25 million surplus.
That was-- a couple of people have suggested we take out that number since our numbers keep
changing. And as Bob Broom says, we are in kind of quicksand. So I think at this point the proposal
would be, enter 2021 with a surplus. That's my amendment.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Do I have a second for Director Guissinger's motion to amend?
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek, second.
TROY WHITMORE: I'll second, Whitmore.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. I think Director Buzek chimed in first. So we'll go with him.
All right. So I'd like to first ask the staff, since we're modifying-- or maybe Director Catlin, do you
think it's appropriate to get a reading from the staff or just to reaffirm that this will be fine from
their standpoint?

PEGGY CATLIN: I would appreciate for the record an affirmation. I appreciate the amendment.
I think as I reviewed the meeting minutes from the retreat, I think that the summary that we were
given may not have reflected it, but I think it's implicit in the core goals. So I'm fine with
amendments. But I would like to hear an affirmation by staff.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. All righty, please. I'm not sure whom to turn it over to, if that would
be General Manager Ballard, if he's there, please?
PAUL BALLARD: Yes, absolutely. This is Paul Ballard, CEO and General Manager. And you
know, the whole process of goal setting started back in March. And we've worked very hard to
come up with a nice summary that people can remember, that we can work with, and also that we
can share with the candidates for the General Manager and CEO position. I think that's also
important.
So we've worked these goals together. We reviewed the proposed amendment from Director
Guissinger. And we find it consistent. And so the staff is enthusiastically in support of adopting
these goals tonight with the amendment.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you for the comment and information, General Manager.
All righty. And I apologize for my cat. He's roused himself and is meowing.
So OK. Let's go around and see if there are questions or comments about the proposed amendment.
Director Williams?
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Chair. No, I appreciate the staff's endorsement and I will
be a yes vote.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Here, here. No comments.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Only because staff is enthusiastically in support of this, I'll do it. I don't think it's
good practice to change goals this close, this far into the year on which those goals were, for which
those goals were created. But if staff's up for the challenge, then I'll support staff's enthusiasm and
I'll be a yes vote.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, ma'am. I concur in and adopt the comments of Director
Walker.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you much. Director Mihalik.

KEN MIHALIK: No questions or comments from me.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Hopefully we can get this really solid in the record. Because when I heard
the verbal description, the last thing I heard is what I'm mainly focused on, and we end the year
with enough going into the next year. But so I don't know if you want to read that again or
something. But it wasn't quite clear. And so that's my only comment on it.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. I can turn it over to Director Guissinger. But what I heard her say for the
final bullet, under strategic priority number six, move RTD toward stable financial situation. An
added bullet that says, enter 2021 with a surplus. Did I get that correct, Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: That's correct.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: But wasn't there another amendment before that also, another part to it?
SHELLEY COOK: Forgive me, a different bullet. Yes. Go ahead, Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: The first bullet under that strategic priority says, make decisions that
prepare for projected deficits in 2021 while meeting the Board's COVID budget response
principles.
NATALIE MENTEN: So just those two additions.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, that's under the last piece. And there were several others before that.
SHELLEY COOK: There were three others [INTERPOSING VOICES]. Yeah, read those first
three, four, if you would.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK. Under the goals related to COVID-19 response, at the end of the
financial section, you add a new bullet that says, make decisions that prepare for projected deficits
in 2021 while meeting the Board's COVID budget response principles.
Then the second one is, before the heading 2020 Strategic Priorities, insert the following heading,
goals set pre COVID, paren, with modifications, end paren.
Then under strategic priority number one for 2020, add a new bullet, begin building partnerships
with local governments, agencies, and non-profits for seamless mobility options.
And then the last two were the ones that I just read, strategic priority number six, move RTD-these are under the 2020 priorities-- strategic priority number six, move RTD towards stable
financial situation. First bullet, make decisions that prepare for projected deficits in 2021 while
meeting the Board's COVID budget response principles. Second bullet, enter 2021 with a surplus.

NATALIE MENTEN: All right. Thank you for going through those again. That's all I had. Thank
you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: I'll be in support of the amendment. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm actually looking for the email that Director Guissinger would have sent
us, because I just need to see this in written form. I appreciate her doing this orally, but I'm having
a hard time keeping up.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It went out from Ms. McManus.
SHELLEY COOK: Correct, yes. Go ahead.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Let see if I can-SHELLEY COOK: It was sent, I think, on the 7th from Barbara McManus. And it was actually
communication from Director Catlin, if I got all of that right. It was on the 9th. Sorry, 7/9. And
you know what, I can forward, does that-LYNN GUISSINGER: --made a couple of changes from what I read tonight from that.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah, you don't have to-- you can you can forward it to me. Don't, please
don't be slowed down by me in this moment. Like feel free to move forward.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you. And I did just forward that email. It's in the body of the email.
Director Guissinger, any added comments here?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin. Anything to add here?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to add that all of Director Guissinger's
amendments are very consistent with what was discussed at our retreat and with the core goals. So
I will be supporting the amendment. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you much. Director Broom.

BOB BROOM: I'm OK with the amendment.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I share the same feeling that Director Guissinger, or Director
Catlin has just said, is that I think it's fine. And I'm really pleased to support it with the enthusiasm
of the staff.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And likewise, I'll just say ditto.
So let's go ahead with a vote, if we can. And I'll start towards that back end of the alphabet again.
Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you for giving me the opportunity, and I vote yes on this.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: An enthusiastic yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And just for the sake of the record, this
is voting on the amendments as proposed by Director Guissinger and communicated to the Board
in an email sent on July 9 at 5:45 PM with the text of the email containing the specific amendment
that Director Guissinger read into the record tonight. Based upon that understanding and staff's
support, I vote yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you for that clarification. I would say that there were a couple of
changes made. She omitted one of those items. So I think what she read into the record is what
we're passing here.
But it's very similar to what was sent through two weeks ago. It's just that item number four has
been deleted and the $25 million specific wording was omitted in that final bullet note. Did I
capture the two changes, or all the changes, Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: You did. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. Thank you. And Director Tisdale, OK?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. Thank you very much for that clarification. My vote remains yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Mihalik.

KEN MIHALIK: With all that clarification, I'm a yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: And Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: And I'm a yes too. So that motion to amend is approved unanimously.
I believe we had one other potential motion to amend. I'll ask if there are any others. But Director
Lubow, go ahead.
JUDY LUBOW: You know in, the interest of brevity, I've decided to not move forward with that.
I think it can be subsumed into some of the other bullets. So I'm just not moving with it. Thank
you.

SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you, Director Lubow. Does anybody else have any items they'd
like to move as a motion to amend before we turn to the main motion?
OK. All right. Let's just quickly go around, see if there's any further discussion on the main motion.
And I'll start from the top. Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: No additional questions.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No questions.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: No. I would just encourage support of this so that our staff can not be in limbo
anymore.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Excuse me. No questions, and I'm in support. So I'm a yes vote. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I'll be a yes vote. I appreciate Director Catlin's comments and hope that we
will be able to change 2021 as we need to, since we're in a fluid time. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you very much. Yes, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah, I'm good.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow? Main motioner.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, I'll be a yes vote. Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Menten, any comments or questions on the main motion?
NATALIE MENTEN: Simply question under 2020 strategic priority number two, address transit
equity. There are portions of this that are in yellow highlight. Is that recently added language that
was changed? Why is it highlighted in yellow?
SHELLEY COOK: Good question. Director Catlin, can you respond?
PEGGY CATLIN: Those were added quite a few weeks ago and circulated among the Directors.
And that was before the current version which went out last week that incorporated the core goals
into the task goals were added. So they have been-- they were circulated quite a while ago, and
they were in response to two things.

One was that in spite of the discussion at the Board retreat that we look at both social equity and
geographic equity as we move forward and that the FasTracks plan encompass the broader
FasTracks plan and not just the unfunded corridors, those were the two amendments that were
proposed more than a month ago and highlighted in yellow.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right. Thank you for helping me understand why it was in yellow.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Any other questions?
NATALIE MENTEN: That's it. Nope, that's it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I don't know if staff wants to add to that, but that's the way I understood it
to be.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. General Manager Ballard or Heather McKillop, anybody who
wants to chime in here?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: This is Heather McKillop.
PAUL BALLARD: Go ahead, Heather.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I was just going to say, that is a correct statement. That's why it was
highlighted, because it was different than the original information that was sent out. But this has
been circulating for a couple weeks.
SHELLEY COOK: Mr. Ballard?
PAUL BALLARD: I'm in agreement.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, good. Thank you. Any other questions, Director Menten? No, I don't think
she did.
NATALIE MENTEN: No, no, no.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik, any questions?
KEN MIHALIK: No, I had something similar, actually. I'm just flooded with emails and it's hard
to see every change that happens with these documents. But yeah, I had a similar question on the
highlighted portions.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you.
KEN MIHALIK: --emphasis on social equity elements, the training and all these things. That's
part of this I'll be a no. I just think it's a euphemism that is abstract and I don't know what it means
[AUDIO OUT] document.

SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you, Director Mihalik/ Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. You may recall that I mentioned the
other day the webinar that APTA conducted about relations between General Manager and the
Board, and the point behind that was to have specific measurable goals for a general manager when
conducting reviews. And generally speaking, that's what we do.
Some of these are not quantified and are not specific. They're more like statements, such as make
decisions. But nonetheless, I think that the spirit is there. I think it's good. And as I said before,
because staff is in support of all of this, I will support the motion as amended. Thank you, ma'am.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you, Director Tisdale. I've been hearing good things about that and plan
to listen in myself. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. Yes, so I'll pretty much echo Director Tisdale, because we were both on
the same call. There's a book that you can read, and I think Mr. Ballard read it, and Mr. Ford is
making his way through it now, on that presentation. But anyway, so like I said, like I said earlier,
staff supports these goals and I'm fine with them. I'd prefer more specific. But it's good. If they're
good, I'm good. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: I support. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I think we've done a good job of looking what needs to be done, and I am in
support.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm also in support.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. And I likewise am. But I just want to underscore that I'm hoping, and I'm
glad that we're considering that 2021, at this point, to be less firm. As Director Broom has pointed
out, things are so fluid right now. And it will just make sense to revisit those as we get a little bit
further down the road.
So let's go ahead with the vote, if we may. I'll quickly go around, starting with the beginning of
the alphabet. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Buzek, on the main motion.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.

SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska. Director Folska? We'll come back for her. Director
Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes, ma'am.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska, are you back?

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes, I am. Sorry about that. I had to find a plug. Yes, I'm here. Yes. I mean,
yes.
SHELLEY COOK: And I'm a yes vote as well. And so I show it as 13 to 2 vote, 13 in favor, 2
opposed. The two opposed are Director Menten and Director Mihalik. And that was the main
motion as amended.
So OK, we're through the action items. And I wanted to propose something for the updates. Heather
McKillop has indicated that she can provide a written report. We don't currently have backup for
either the 2021 or 2050, to 2050 long range plan and the VIA update. She's able to provide a quick
memo, or an email, to give us an update subsequent to this meeting.
And then what she's suggesting on the 2019 county allocation report is that we merely have her
introduce it and then we'll say she's available, as always, for questions about it later. Does anybody
object to removing those three items from the update section of our meeting tonight?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Can you repeat that, Director Cook, please?
SHELLEY COOK: Sure. You bet. There are five items listed under Updates, item C on the agenda.
Three of them we're talking about the idea of deferring. One is a discussion, with no backup, of
the 2021 to 2050 long range plan. A second one is the VIA update. And for those two, CFO
McKillop would send us an email to just give us a quick recap on those.
And on the 2019 county allocation report, this is an update of a report that was done earlier. She
would like to just introduce that allocation. And then, without going into too much detail on it, just
indicate that she is available for questions. Or, of course, we could do a quick round then. Do you
object to removing any of those three, or does anybody?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I don't. I just wanted to clarify what you were saying. Thank you for repeating
that.
SHELLEY COOK: Not at all.
KATE WILLIAMS: This is Director Williams. I am in favor. I champion it. I second it.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, it wasn't actually a motion, but that's good to have support. Anybody else
have any-LYNN GUISSINGER: This is Director Guissinger. I have some questions and concerns about the
county allocations, but I'm fine with it. I assume this will come back to us, we'll have a chance to
ask some questions. There's a huge amount-- one of my initial questions-- there's a huge amount
of unallocated interest. And I'd like to follow up on that.
But I'm happy to talk to Heather separately. But I do think it's something that we might want to
bring back to the Board at some point and look at [AUDIO OUT] important [AUDIO OUT].

SHELLEY COOK: That sounds like-LYNN GUISSINGER: But I'm OK with taking it short tonight.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. All righty. Anybody else?
OK. So CFO McKillop, let's quickly go through the mid-term financial plan. It's pretty important
stuff. So go ahead. I'll turn it over to you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Heather McKillop, CFO. I just wanted to give you an update. Bruce
touched a little bit on this. But we have provided just a snapshot of the meetings coming up for the
mid-term financial plan in July and August. The calendar that you received that was referenced
earlier has a lot more dates on this. But we just were trying to boil it down to what we need to
accomplish in the next few weeks.
A reminder that tomorrow and Thursday, Reimagine advisory and technical committee meetings,
where they'll be discussing the presentation that was presented to you earlier today by Holly and
the Reimagine team. We are getting a Leeds forecast update. Actually, I had a call with them today
and they gave me a draft, or gave me a couple [AUDIO OUT] to get out to the Board. That will be
discussed at the study session on July 28. And we will be looking for a direction on moving forward
with that revenue forecast going forward.
Then, August 4, we'll have another study session where the results, or some of the results, of the
internal task force will be presented. Then we also, listed in here, the August 3 through 7, we'll get
another update on actuals [AUDIO OUT] and we'll be able to share that with the Board. August
11, we have a Finance and Administration Committee, where we'll be talking about fares. Then
again, we have another update to the Leeds forecast with June actuals. Another study session on
the 25th, where we'll be [AUDIO OUT] based on the COVID-19 internal task force. And then just
a reminder, we have a Reimagine Advisory and Technical Committee on August 26 and 27.
I think one thing I missed on the 25th that's really important is the Board will be giving
concurrence, we hope, on releasing the draft SOP for public outreach and engagement, so that we
can have that ready for the run board for January. So that's really the status, just trying to give you
a fair warning on how busy it's going to be in the next, every week, pretty much, we have something
going on. And that's just through August.
Please look at that calendar that Barbara sent out because it goes all the way through the end of
the year. [AUDIO OUT] have to deal with. So with that, I'd be glad to take any questions.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Yeah that, is a lot. All right. All right. Who is that? OK, I wasn't sure if
somebody was chiming in. But Director Broom, do you have any questions about the calendar and
the plan for proceeding on the mid-term financial plan here?
BOB BROOM: No, I don't.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek.

VINCE BUZEK: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No, I'm good.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Nothing.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No, nothing for me.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Nothing, ma'am.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Nothing for me. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Nothing more, Madam Chair. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: No, ma'am. Thank you.

SHELLEY COOK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm good. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: And I'm likewise. I would just reinforce her request that you take a good look
at this in terms of the process and timeline. So thank you, Heather.
So the next item, you're going to introduce the 2019 county allocation report. And would you be
willing to take this, bring this back to us at some future point, when we don't have such a crowded
agenda?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: [AUDIO OUT] that. And like Director Guissinger, if you have specific
questions, now that you've seen it, be sure to give myself or Susan a call, Susan Cohen, and we
will be able to walk you through it and try to answer those questions. And then we can bring it
back at a future meeting.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Perfect. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Everybody good there? Chime in if you have any questions here or I'll
move on.
OK. Last item under Update, May 2020 monthly financial status report. Go ahead, Heather.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So just real quick on this. I wanted to point out that we do have the May
numbers in here. We did receive the actuals. From all the red, it's [AUDIO OUT]. But it was
slightly higher than what we expected in May. Now it turns out that April and some of the
assumptions that were made by Leeds did not materialize for April. So it was actually worse than
what we had shown you. But May is slightly better.
So our expectation, after talking to Leeds, is that the forecast will be a little worse than what they
showed you just a week or two ago but much better than the original May forecast. So I'll be
working on getting those comparisons out to you, hopefully by the end of the week but it might be
early next week to get that information put together.
Ridership as you see, is not doing well. But it's very consistent with where we've been the last, in
the April timeframe. And fare revenue was, of course, down because we weren't collecting fares
in the May timeframe. So pretty much what we expected. I don't think there's anything major. I'll
ask Doug-- I think he's on the line-- if he wants to, if he thinks there's anything else we should
point out. But those were the big things I wanted to mention was the sales tax.
DOUG MCLEOD: This is Doug McLeod, Controller. No, thank you. You covered it all, Heather.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Thank you. Anybody have any questions? Go ahead. Any questions for
Heather or Doug here?
PEGGY CATLIN: Madam Chair, if I might. This is Peggy Catlin.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: I just wanted to comment that the fact that April wasn't as good as forecast,
that May was better just illustrates the volatility or whatever, the volatile nature of these
projections, and that I think it's very important for us to remain very conservative in moving
forward on some of these budget projections. So I appreciate the information. But it really does
demonstrate that there's not a lot of certainty right now.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. And it underscores a point that Director Broom and others had
made when they came to us a couple of weeks ago, that things are so fluid, it pays to be careful
here. Anybody else?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Madam Chair, if I might. This morning I listened in to a
conference, a press conference that Mr. Ballard was part of. And it was, I can't remember, 8 or 10
agencies who were asking, they were coming together to ask for funding for transit from Congress.
But the one thing that stuck in my head more than anything was all of these transit agencies, we're
all struggling together, right. And I believe it was New Jersey that said they needed $1.2 billion to
get them through the end of this year. And when I heard that, it kind of put me into a point of
reality where we are in a very, very fluid point right now.
And so I think that this is tricky. And I think, I absolutely agree with First Vice Chair Catlin that
we need to be cautious and conservative and really look at these things. Knowing that it's going to
be changing constantly. I like to think of it as being on a surf board in a tsunami. So you know, I
just think we need to also realize that it's not just us, it's the entire transit community. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. And would acknowledge that our General Manager participated
in a webinar talking about these very issues and the importance of the support at the federal level.
So I appreciate that involvement too.
Anybody else?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Chair Cook? Yes, Director Folska here.
SHELLEY COOK: Sure, go ahead.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you. I like the idea of taking a very conservative approach no matter
what. And that's going to get us into that surplus zone, I would hope. I really appreciate Chair
Rivera-Malpiede's comments about New Jersey, and that is a lot of money. But it's also important
to keep in mind, I think, that that transit agency serves the entire state. So it's all relative. Thank
you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. That's a good point.
Anybody else?

OK. Thank you, Heather. Really appreciate all your work, and then Doug, as well, Jannette,
everybody in your team, Bruce Abel, et cetera.
So the way we normally handle the items under Information is we just refer to it. It's there. Nobody
has so far requested that it be removed so that we could ask questions. And so I'll go ahead and
just assume that. But let me give you a chance here if anybody wants to pull that and ask a question
about the LiVe update. Either that or you could certainly get it to staff as well outside of the
meeting.
SHONTEL LEWIS: This is Director Lewis. I don't want to pull it. But I do appreciate that it's
there. And I think if we are looking at reductions in unemployment for folks, as we're looking at
the discontinuance of the memorandum or, excuse me, the moratorium on evictions that we are
probably going to see an influx of folks who might be utilizing that. And so just an appreciation
that it's available to our communities who might need to access that during these terrible times.
SHELLEY COOK: Very good point. Thank you.
OK. Under Other Matters, does anybody have anything to bring forward under Other Matters?
SHONTEL LEWIS: No, we're good.
SHELLEY COOK: Well, I am [INTERPOSING VOICES].
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I do. I do. I do.
SHELLEY COOK: Go ahead, Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: You know, I'd like to get some clarity on the mask thing. I think that the
messaging is getting very confusing and convoluted. And I think it's important for the public to
know that we mandate mask wearing. And I know there are going to be exemptions, exceptions
and so forth.
But you know, the folks that are, 40% of them transmitting this pandemic or this COVID virus,
are asymptomatic. And we see cases are rising here in Colorado, even. So the governor is not
willing to do it, but governors in other states are, California, New York. And actually today, in
Jefferson County, of all places, they not only mandated mask wearing, if you're caught not wearing
one, I think it's $1,000 fine.
So it is the case that it's mandated in Denver. But we need to have something that's consistent and
ubiquitous throughout our District, I think.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Are you-- do you want-- shall we get a response to that or were you just
offering that observation?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yeah, I mean, we're well into this, you know, and it's going to be another
year before we're out of it, at least. And it's just not sufficient to say, well, you know, be reasonable,

use your logic, be rational, you know, don't wear it at your own risk, all of this. I mean, you know,
we need to say, wear a mask. Boom. It's over. It's done with. Let's move on with trying to fix the
problem.
So yeah, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm pretty fed up with it, to be honest.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. Michael Ford or Paul Ballard, do you want to weigh in here? Or can we
discuss how we can have that conversation or respond to her?
MICHAEL FORD: Hi. This is Michael Ford, COO. We are continuing to try to ensure that people
are wearing masks. We do have audible signs-- excuse me, audible messages on our vehicles and
they do say a mask is required. Obviously we can't police everybody. We look to law enforcement
to help with those kinds of things. But we do make it very clear with our signage.
We also have masks on our buses. We've been handing those things out, along with other PPEs.
So we've been trying to do everything we can to educate our public, continue to help and support
our operators.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK, OK, OK, OK, wait a second here. I appreciate that. And I know that
it's on the buses and that it's audible. But it isn't in our communications messaging at all. The only
thing you see is social distance, social distance. And I don't think that's adequate.
So somewhere along the line, the silos need to be broken down here. And they need to be
coordinated better that the messaging that comes out of our Communications department reflects
what you're doing in Operations. Right now it doesn't do that.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. And no, that's all right. Maybe the way we could leave it is to ask that
they take a look. I've been seeing more cases of it indicating a requirement. But there are still, there
still is mentioned, here and there, of sort of voluntary nature and urging people and so forth.
Can we just-- I mean, I don't know if there is, if the Board as a whole wants to, but I'd be interested
in having Communications take a look and just make sure we're being consistent in our messaging.
Would that be OK, Mr. Ford?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: That's all, yeah. For me, that's all I'm hoping for.
MICHAEL FORD: Michael Ford, COO. We'll definitely look into it and see what else we can do
to up our communications or enhance where necessary. But we take this matter very, very
seriously. So we can provide the Board an update, work with Communications, and just ensure
taht what we're doing is actually taking hold. We think we're doing a good job but we can always
look and see what other improvements we can make. So I appreciate this comment.
SHELLEY COOK: And just-- yeah thank, you. And [AUDIO OUT] just add this one thing. I will
say there is a much greater practice now on board buses for riding the masks. So I think just keeping
on that and making sure that we're consistently messaging on that would be really good. But I
wanted to acknowledge the progress already made.

Anybody else have any on Other Matters?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director-- This is Director Lewis. I just wanted to make a quick comment.
Because Director, or Chair Rivera-Malpiede did bring this up when we were having discussions
with the Code of Conduct, and so it might be an opportunity to partner with the Chair to figure out
how to bring the universal mask wearing and the messaging forward in a way that feels more
concise.
SHELLEY COOK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede, you OK with that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I'm happy to do that, for sure. Because I think it is a message
that we need to make stronger that just says, you have to have a mask to get on this bus. And I
don't know if it's signage on the buses. And I know Mr. Meader, we talked about that as well in
the Code of Conduct.
But I do think we need to make a really very, very strong statement to people that we're not just
wanting you to partner with us. We need you to help us keep everybody safe. And so it's kind of
the deal of no shoes, no shirt, no service. No mask, no riding. And I think we need I think we need
to be tough. I think that we owe that to our patrons and to our bus drivers and just to our community.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Anybody else?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten, [INTERPOSING VOICES].
SHELLEY COOK: Go ahead, Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: I'll be very, very blunt. There are people who have been raped and have a
hand over their mouth. There are people who are claustrophobic. There are people who have
medical conditions. By us refusing bus service to them, we are not considering those factors. I'll
leave it at that. Thank you.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. Anybody else?
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: So I'll be quick. 6:30 this morning I participated in the Get Our Region Moving
outreach at Wagon Road with Christina Zazueta from our Communications Department. So it was
good news, bad news. The bad news being that the Wagon Road Park-and-Ride, one of the busiest
in the region, was virtually empty. But the good news is everyone that boarded the bus was wearing
a mask, both of them. That's all I had. Thanks.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, gosh, that's heart [AUDIO OUT]. Thank you. Anybody else?

SHONTEL LEWIS: I just have a correction. Because I couldn't-- this is Director Lewis-- I couldn't
get off the music hold, and I think I might have missed a vote for the Accountability Committee.
And so I just wanted to clear that before we ended this phone call. I know it's not in Other Matters,
but just wanted to clear it.
SHELLEY COOK: So we showed you as an abstention. Melanie, are we-- with her permission-able to change that if she wishes to a yes or no?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, you can.
SHELLEY COOK: What would be your vote on that item, Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes, please.
SHELLEY COOK: OK. We'll show the vote corrected vote then. Do you have that, Barbara
McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, great. Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thanks, Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: You bet. Anybody else?
OK I have one. I'm so sorry. This was assigned to me. So the staff tell me we've only heard from
a few Directors regarding the Hogodoc app. Now this is the thing that we need to download an
activate an account and then view a test document. Because once we do that, then we'll be able to
look at the resumes that have been submitted to the agency for the General Manager position.
And they'll be open for review starting this Sunday, July 19. So I think what we're doing is urging
people that-- at 5:00 PM-- we're urging people to make sure you're able to look at that before it's
the weekend for sure. Because then you wouldn't be able to open the document and give the staff
as much room as you can to provide technical assistance if you end up needing it. So please try to
do that tomorrow. OK?
OK. Anybody else?
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Cook, thanks for reminding me. And I'm one of those who hasn't been
able to do that because I've had some technical difficulties. But I do want to remind those who are
on the committee for the Executive Search Committee that we are having a meeting this Thursday
after the Executive Committee that Gregg Moser actually requested to discuss a couple of key
issues, one of them being salary range and boundaries, and then other being the outreach.
And so if those of you who are not on the committee want to call in, that is at 1:30. Thank you.

SHELLEY COOK: Thank you. A good reminder and recap.
OK, with that, I'll take a motion to adjourn.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved.
TROY WHITMORE: Whitmore.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, Chair Rivera-Malpiede mover and Director Whitmore as seconder. OK.
All in favor, say-- well let's say anybody opposed, please indicate so.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'm opposed. I want [AUDIO OUT] some more.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: OK. We'll record the no vote, Director Williams. OK.
VINCE BUZEK: She can stay on for the next time for the four-hour music.
SHELLEY COOK: Director Buzek likes the muzak. OK. With that, I'll go ahead and end up.
Thank you, everybody.
