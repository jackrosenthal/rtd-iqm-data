GM
Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Workday for licenses for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase2 (Human Capital Management and
Payroll) for an amount not to exceed $2,700,000 over 5 years. RTD will be utilizing the City and
County of Denver’s contract with Workday. Subscriptions for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase 2
will be paid annually.
General Manager Goals:
 Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
The current Oracle e-business suite (EBS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation at RTD is
approaching end of life. Oracle will end support for the EBS system in 2021.
Starting in 2017, the Information Technology team began researching various approaches for the ERP
replacement. Modern ERP solutions are moving toward a cloud-based, specialized solution. Three options
for replacement were presented to the AGM’s for consideration:
Upgrade the existing ERP Oracle system to Oracle Cloud.
1. Implement another vendor’s single cloud ERP solution (such as SAP or Workday)
2. Use a best-of-breed hybrid approach by implementing ERP cloud-based solutions for specific lines
of business (such as finance and human resources)
The options were presented to the AGM’s and they determined to use a best-of-breed, hybrid approach.
This enables RTD to take advantage of the strengths of various cloud-based solutions to improve
business operations and more closely align the cloud/software solution to business process. Cloud tools
make it easier to implement a best-of-breed approach and they also allow for integration between the
differing systems.
During the research phase, demonstrations of several vendor’s solutions were held with RTD business
units to determine the functionality needs and best fit for RTD business processes. Through this series
of demos and requirements gathering sessions, the determination was made that the human resources
and payroll modules will utilize Workday. The human resources and payroll related modules in the second
phase of the ERP replacement project include:

The current Oracle HCM and payroll modules are outdated and do not provide the functionality needed
by RTD. Oracle will end support for the current EBS system in 2021. Over the past eighteen months,
multiple vendors were invited to demo their solutions for these modules with RTD business units. The
Workday solution best fit the needs of the business units as well as the specific public-sector business
needs of RTD. Workday was also chosen because of the dependence and integration needed between
these modules and the finance backbone.
The Board previously approved a total of $15,000,000 for the complete ERP Replacement Program in
the 2018 - 2023 Strategic Budget Plan. The contract authority recommended in this board action will
use a portion of this approved funding for this second phase of ERP program licenses.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an RFI to obtain pricing for these modules with the National Association of State Budget
Officers (NASBO). NASBO has pre-negotiated contracts with the State of Colorado. The State bid and
awarded these contracts through their standard procurement processes and these contracts allow other
governmental agencies to utilize them. RTD also investigated using the City and County of Denver (CCD)
Workday contract to take advantage of the discounts provided to the City. CCDs contract is a
cooperative agreement and was competitively bid. Based on review of the two options, CCD’s contract
was more advantageous to RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,700,000. Funding for these licenses is included in the
approved ERP Replacement Program budget.
The yearly breakdown for the licenses is as follows:
2019
2020
2021
2022
2023

$684,640
$491,295
$491,295

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amendment No. 3 regarding plan changes recommended by the Salaried
Employee Pension Trustees.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability, and Task Goal #2 –
Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
It is the fiduciary responsibility of the Pension Trustees to continually review the plan provisions and
ensuring that they continue to meet the goals of the Pension plan. In August, Rael & Letson the pension
plan actuarial made several recommendations to the plan assumptions.
These recommendations include the following:


For benefits payable as a periodic annuity with an Annuity Start after January 1, 2019, the
adjustment factors for lump sum payments will be actuarially determined based on an interest
rate of 7% instead of the current rate of 7.5%.



Utilize the appropriate RP-2014 Mortality Table for healthy employees and annuitant without the
blue-collar adjustment to achieve the same actuarial impact on the Plan as the table with bluecollar adjustments effective January 1, 2019.
The mortality table was last updated in 2014 and the actuarial made recommendations regarding
some changes based on this pension plans specific experience. The Trustees reviewed the
various tables and determined that the table should be changed to the RP-2014 Mortality Table
for healthy employees and annuitants without blue-collar adjustment, to properly reflect the job
characteristics of the salaried employees in the Plan.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The actuarial recommended contribution prior to these changes would have been $7.95 million/year after
these recommendations the actuarial recommended contribution will be $8.68 million/ year. This is an
increase of $730,000/ year. For 2019, RTD is contributing $5.6 million.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the attached Amendment No. 3 regarding plan changes recommended by the
Salaried Employee Pension Trustees.

2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, this is not the preferred alternative
as this may have a negative impact on the funding of the pension plan.

This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Core Goal #1: Successful
Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The route 15L runs between the Decatur-Federal Station in Denver and the Aurora Metro Center Station
in Aurora, a total distance of 15 miles, on Colfax Avenue, owned by the Colorado Department of
Transportation. Between Broadway and I-225 the route makes limited stops, spaced approximately ½mile (8 blocks) apart. The 15 and 15L routes combined carry approximately 24,000 passengers on
weekdays, which is comparable to the southwest light rail corridor (C & D lines combined). Many of the
15L stops have more than 500 boardings per weekday, and the eastbound (EB) stop at Lincoln has more
than 2,000 boardings per weekday.
The 15L stops were originally constructed in 1986-87, many with “half-back” shelters consisting of a
canopy structure on top of a short concrete wall, along with benches built into the walls and trash
receptacles. Over the years many shelters have been damaged and removed, while others have been
removed due to safety concerns (i.e. EB Colfax at Lincoln). No significant capital improvements have
been made to the 15L stops in the last 30 years.
This requested Board action culminates RTD’s planning and design efforts that have been underway on
the East Colfax Corridor for several years. RTD, in a partnership with the City and County of Denver
(CCD), completed a Transit Signal Priority (TSP) study for the corridor in 2014. The study included
recommendations for bus stop enhancements as well as operational improvements including bus bulbs,
queue jump/bypass lanes and TSP that could be implemented in the near-term future to improve transit
travel time and reliability for the Route 15L.
With information from the completed study, RTD was able to secure a total of $9,025,000 in federal
and state grant funds, including a Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Ladders of Opportunity grant, a
CDOT FASTER grant, a DRCOG Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) grant, and
a Senate Bill -1 grant award, for design, construction, materials testing, and inspection of the project.
Since FASTER grant funds will be used, CDOT also must approve the award of this contract.

2.14.D

In a parallel effort, the City & County of Denver continues to pursue their Colfax Corridor Connections
project, which began in 2012 and eventually hopes to construct Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) dedicated lanes
in the center of Colfax. The Colfax Corridor Connections project is still in the concept phase, with
environmental clearance planned to begin in 2019. The Elevate Denver Bond Program set aside $55
million, for implementation of BRT from Auraria to Yosemite. The City and County of Denver does not
have all the funding identified to build the center running BRT project. The Elevate Denver Bond funds
need to be spent by 2027. RTD and CCD staff have been working together to ensure that Colfax
Corridor Connections will utilize the improvements put in place by the 15L Route Improvements Project.
Once the Colfax Corridor Connections BRT is constructed, the new shelters installed as part of this
project can be relocated to another BRT corridor within the District (e.g. Federal, Broadway, and Speer).
The shelters are designed to be moved, and have interchangeable parts with some of the other shelters
that we currently use.
DISCUSSION
The 15L Route Improvements project will improve the passenger experience, passenger safety, and
service reliability for 15L riders in the near-term until the Colfax Corridor Connections project is
constructed. Improvements are planned to be made to 37 stops (total, eastbound and westbound)
including:
Bus Stop Improvements
 Enhanced shelters with lighting, trash receptacles and benches
 Security cameras at most stops
 Programmable Information Display Systems (PIDS) as a pilot program at six stops
 Concrete bus pads
Operational Improvements
 Bus bulbouts (curb extensions) at 11 stops
o Bulbouts allow buses to stop in the travel lane, improving safety and reducing dwell time
o Bulbouts also provide additional space for amenities and waiting passengers
 Queue bypass lanes and queue jump signals for buses at 9 locations
 Relocating stops to the far-side of the intersection where possible
 Expanded boarding areas with space for two buses where possible
 Re-spacing of bus stops per Service Development
 Transit signal priority at 14 intersections in Denver (already installed under a separate project)
After completing the required environmental review and developing 100% construction plans for the
above listed improvements, RTD issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on September 17, 2018. A pre-bid
and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) outreach meeting was held on October 4, and bid opening
was on November 13, 2018. The apparent low bidder is Jalisco International, Inc. Document review is
being finalized to determine if the apparent low bidder is responsive and responsible.
Bidder List:

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 23

2.14.D

The funds for this Project are appropriated in the 2019 Adopted Budget. Funding for maintenance of the
new shelters, lighting, and camera systems elements has been included in the mid-range plan ($125,000
for 2019 and $250,000 for subsequent years).
DBE / SBE GOAL
RTD has established a 24% DBE participation goal. Jalisco International, Inc. is a DBE firm, and has
committed to meet the DBE goal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
execute the contract for the 15L Route improvements with Jalisco International, Inc. in the dollar
amount of $8,690,000.00, subject to evaluating the bid for being responsive and responsible,
and Colorado Department of Transportation approval (CDOT). Funding for this contract is
included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the Colfax Transit Improvements project.
Any
changes to the contract amount and performance will be made in compliance with the RTD
Procurement Manual and Agreements governing the Grant funds.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the 15L to operate as it exists today and continue
to maintain the existing stops. This is not recommended, since the awarded grants could be lost.
3. Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as construction bid prices continue to trend
upwards, and it is possible that grant funding could be lost.

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from
December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, and to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by
$1,200,000 to a total of $192,623,336. Funding for this contract is included in the 2019 Adopted
Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where Program Support Consulting
(PSC) support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Core Goal #1:
Delivery of Transit Services.

Successful

BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that have brought the current
Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to $191,423,336. In May, 2017, the Board extended the contract
completion date to December 31, 2019 without increasing the contract price. At that time, the contract
was amended to cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected timeframes of
availability for each one.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract originally was specified for a term of six years with a six-year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. In May, 2017, the contract end
date was extended to the current end date of December 31, 2019.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to retain
the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts, meet final reporting requirements for FTA
grant projects, and finalize the transactions and mapping that will secure the right-of-way for the

Packet Pg. 25

2.14.E

program alignments, including survey and mapping support for final acquisitions and utility relocations,
post-construction surveys, and filing of right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension to the Jacobs
contract would make the resources available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and
cost-effective manner.
In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces claims and lawsuits related to its
projects. Support from the PSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual were to leave Jacobs
before the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining hours
for that individual. Any future consultant support outside of these designated areas will be procured
through the Construction Management Support Consultant contract with Triunity-Hill, and will not be
added to the scope of this contract.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW),
and utility survey for all corridors and facilities
North Metro
 Provide construction support through end of 2020
 Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support
I-225
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support
 Provide construction support through project closeout
SEC Ext.
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
 Provide P3 and railroad support through project closeout
 Provide Federal Agency Liaison and Risk Manager through project closeout
 Provide full time Project Controls Manager and Contract Manager through project closeout
 Provide FEIS/ROD mitigation monitoring through project closeout
 Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support
 Provide construction oversight through project closeout
 Provide support for the ongoing litigation with Denver Transit Partners
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The DBE report through September 2018
indicates that the PSC’s actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 19%. RTD does not foresee any
additional opportunities for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the named
roles are filled by Jacobs employees. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed amount, the
DBE participation on the overall contract would be approximately 18.6%.

Packet Pg. 26

2.14.E

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2020, would
increase to $192,623,336 with this amendment. Funding for the remainder of this contract is included
in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC
support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services for
FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2019 to December 31,
2020, and to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,200,000 to a total of
$192,623,336. Funding for this contract is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to extend the
contract completion date for Jacobs Engineering. This is not recommended because RTD does not
have in-house staff with the institutional knowledge, background, and technical skills of the
specific staff to be retained through this amendment, and would not be able to replace their
expertise in a timely and cost-effective manner.

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the
contract completion date from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, and increase the total
contract amount by $1,743,739, for a total contract authorization of $72,726,498. Funding for this
scope is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where FRSC support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Core Goal #1: Successful
Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2011. Subsequently, the FRSC contract was due to expire in November of 2017. In May
of 2017 the Board approved a one year extension of the contract on projects that FRSC had extensive
involvement with. This extension carried forward valuable historical project knowledge and experience.
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:


Provided engineering review and inspection services of the Eagle P3 commuter rail vehicles

Packet Pg. 28

2.14.F



Provided engineering advising services in regard to the commuter rail vehicle equalizer beam
warranty issue

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach has saved the RTD cost and will continue to
facilitate the operation and maintenance of the system. This work effort was consistent with the work
required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to retain
the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet the final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. Other projects will be completing construction and entering systems integrated
testing in 2019. The proposed time extension to the FRSC contract would make the resources available
to RTD to complete construction, systems integrated testing, and project closeout in a timely and costeffective manner.
Specific projects where FRSC assistance is anticipated to continue in 2019 include:
 Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project
 North Metro Rail Line Project
 Southeast Rail Extension Project
 14th & California Track Replacement Project
 Power Switch Upgrade Support Project
 Mariposa Yard Switch Heaters Project
 Welton Blankout Signs Project
 System Wide Stray Current Monitoring
In addition to the listed FasTracks projects, FRSC is the designer of record of state of good repair
projects on the base system. These projects are currently underway but unfinished and retention of
FRSC is recommended for cost and practically purposes. New projects will be assigned to the current
Systems On-Call Consultant (HNTB)
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 20.3% DBE goal. FRSC
has proposed a 15.9% DBE goal for base system work and 17.3% DBE goal for FasTracks work in
2019. Both of these goals exceed the RTD proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope of work to be completed in 2019 is included in the 2019 Adopted Budget for
the FasTracks capital program and in previously approved budgets for base system projects in the
specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2018
to December 31, 2019, and increase the total contract amount by $1,743,739, for a total
contract authorization of $72,726,498. Funding for this scope is included in the 2019 Adopted
Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where FRSC support would be
utilized.

Packet Pg. 29

2.14.F

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach. This is
not recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized staff to meet the System
Engineering needs of the FasTracks Program. Selection of alternative two could delay
implementation of the FasTracks Program.

Authorization for Acquisition of Property for
the North Metro Maintenance Facility

General

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain properties as necessary for
the North Metro Maintenance Facility and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under
state eminent domain law.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Goal – Task Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD’s decision to self-perform the North Metro Commuter Rail Line operations and maintenance was
supported by Board adoption of the Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) which
included RTD’s direct operation and maintenance of the corridor on October 24, 2017. On November
28, 2017, the RTD Board adopted the 2018 budget which included funding for the North Metro capital
budget of $13.4 million which included the first year of facilities modifications, rescue locomotive, fleet
vehicles, heavy equipment and additional expenditures required to support revenue service. Additional
funding for capital projects is included in the 2019 budget.
As part of N Line operations, RTD will require two capital maintenance facilities; the third bay of the 711
Facility and permanent Maintenance of Way facility to be located on properties identified and shown on
the exhibit to the attached resolution.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by survey and authorize the
General Manager and/or Project Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the North Metro budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying
certain properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Maintenance Facility and
authorizing staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

Packet Pg. 31

2.14.G

2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This is not recommended as failure to acquire required
properties would result in the inability to provide the necessary facility required for the operation
and maintenance of the North Metro Commuter Rail N Line.

Subject:

Purchase 14 45 foot Ultra-Low-Sulfur Diesel
Intercity Flatiron Flyer Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of fourteen (14) new forty-five
foot (45’) intercity buses for Flatiron Flyer services from Motor Coach Industries for a price not to
exceed $634,715.17 each and one (1) spare engine and after-treatment for $47,987. The total cost for
the contract is $8,933,999.38.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In 2012, RTD provided the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition with an approach to reaching
defined Flatiron Flyer (FF) service levels by 2021. Those service increases – subject to RTD’s service
standards and the District’s financial capacity – were to be funded by two sources:
1. Travel time savings that resulted from the establishment of the managed lanes in the US 36
Corridor; and
2. Operations and Maintenance funds from the Fast-Track’s plan, which provide an increasing
commitment over time.
The fourteen (14) new coaches will support service along the US 36 corridor in compliance with service
standards and commitments made to the Coalition. These are the same coaches selected through
collaborative processes with US 36 stakeholders.
DISCUSSION
Since opening BRT services on the US 36 corridor, RTD has seen ridership increases on the FF routes.
In order to achieve the planned service levels for 2021 and beyond, RTD needs to purchase additional
vehicles for the corridor. The Fast-Track’s plan has allocated funds for the purchase of these vehicles.
Past MCI intercity coaches were purchased under competitive contract. However, contracts and options
for MCI intercity coach purchases expired in 2017. There are no more planned forty-five foot (45’)
intercity coach purchases for six (6) years. Due to the small number of coaches being ordered and the
length of time between upcoming intercity coach purchases, it is advantageous to piggyback on an
existing contract.
In April, 2013, CDOT issued a competitively sourced contract to MCI for Bustang services. The Bustang
MCI coaches are essentially the same as our other FF buses except where parts have been superseded
or designs have been improved. The initial contract has since been extended through March 30, 2019.

Other entities are allowed to purchase buses on this contract. CDOT has graciously offered to allow the
District to exercise options on their existing contract for this recommended purchase.
Staff is also recommending the purchase of one (1) new spare engine. Current production MCI coaches
have a different engine than the existing fleet to meet air quality specifications. Having an additional
engine on-hand compatible with the new fleet will assist with keeping rolling stock on the road and in
revenue service.
Production of these coaches is expected to begin in late Q3 of 2019 with delivery to be completed in
the last quarter of 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of these buses is available in the 2019 Fast-Tracks budget, project 70064.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of fourteen
(14) new forty-five foot (45’) intercity buses for Flatiron Flyer services from Motor Coach
Industries for a price not to exceed $634,715.17 each and one (1) spare engine and aftertreatment for $47,987. The total cost for the contract is $8,933,999.38. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not proceed with the purchase of these intercity buses. This will cause a delay in the
procurement of these vehicles without any expected benefit in cost.

Subject:

Vanpooling Agreement with DRCOG for 2019

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD financial support
and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $780,000.
General Manager’s Goal:
Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry between six (6) to twelve (12) riders, and
the vehicles are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render
regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools
eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, RTD and DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of
2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed
that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable
mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area.
Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus
routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and
increased commuter transportation alternatives.

2.14.I

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
93 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI (Enterprise) took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently there are
95 active vanpools that carry an average of 5.5 riders per van and the fleet is at 77% capacity.
Vanpool performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations
have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreement is warranted. DRCOG vanpool
performance through September 2018 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat of
approximately $3.09.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program were budgeted in the 2019 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
enter into an Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide
RTD financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver
metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not to
exceed $780,000.
2.
Do not approve the financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program.
This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would eliminate this transportation option for
residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area
and could result in an increase in single occupant commuting.
