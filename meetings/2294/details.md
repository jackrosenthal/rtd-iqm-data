Tiffany Angel, Georgann Van Gemert, John Tarbert and Bob Grado.  All were present to receive their award with the exception of Georgann Van Gemert who was on vacation.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen thanked everyone for their attendance.  He said that each person would have three minutes to speak.  He asked that everyone be respectful of other speakers and not clap or cheer during public participation.

- Honorable Mayor Applebaum, City of Boulder and US 36 Mayors and Commissions Coalition (MCC), shared that initially the MCC had some concerns about the original fare proposal related to equity between bus and rail; however, the RTD staff took the MCC’s concerns seriously and addressed them in the revised proposal before the Board this evening by making bus and rail equitable.  The MCC recognizes that there is still more work to be done for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as well as arterial BRT in the future.  Mayor Applebaum also acknowledged the next phase of the fare study that would look at the pass programs, which will be of high interest to Boulder.  He said on behalf of the City of Boulder and MCC, he thanks RTD and continues to look forward to working together in the future.

- Dianna Janda thanked RTD for the extremely fine bus drivers.  She shared that she often calls in compliments because these drivers care about their fellow man.  They are observant of the people outside their bus and they wait when they see someone is trying to catch the bus.  She stated there has not been any time that a passenger has had an issue with waiting as everyone has been racing to catch a bus at least once.  However, she also calls to complain about the bad bus drivers who do not wait or open their doors when someone is right there.  The time of the people that ride RTD buses is worth something too.  She stated that drivers do not have a right to ignore passengers trying to get on the bus.  She said that bus stops should also be realigned so that drivers can see the other buses that are nearby and know if they might need to wait for transfers from the other buses.

- Tom Grushka, Highlands Ranch, stated that he is legally blind and wearing a hat because he is sensitive to light.  He has been dependent on RTD as his means of transportation for many years.  He said that he has been working on a documentary since 2011 when RTD had a $20 million service cut during the recession but still made a $17 million loan to the Crawford Hotel and Denver Union Station.  Tom Grushka expressed concern that RTD is using public funds for things other than transportation.  He informed everyone that there are eight seats on the Board up for election next year.  If the Directors are not representing the citizens they need to be replaced.  He said that the fare structure is inequitable and staff has not been truthful with the Board about the public’s feedback.  He wondered if anyone on the Board had read the full 700 page transcript from the fare study public hearings.  He stated that $2.60 is outrageous and an economic injustice.   This will destroy low income riders and bus service will be cut anyway as RTD will lose ridership.

- Mary Grushka, Highlands Ranch, said that she must respectfully disagree with the Mayor of Boulder.  The fares the Board is being asked to approve tonight are not equitable.  She sees that some of the light rail fares are going down or staying the same while all the bus fares are going up.  She stated that the riders that depend on RTD are the riders that use the buses.  She does not see how the Board can justify these increases.  RTD is hitting the ones that require RTD the most.

- Linda Meric, National Executive Directors of 9 to 5, stated that 9 to 5 is a national membership organization of women in low wage jobs working to improve policies on workplace fairness.  She noted that affordable and equitable transportation is a necessity.  Many communities lack access to affordable transportation that provides access to jobs, schools, childcare, healthcare, etc. and this is particularly true for low income communities, communities of color and communities with disabilities.  She said that the current RTD fare structure is unaffordable to many in our community, forcing people to choose between a meal and transportation.  The proposal before the Board this evening takes us in the wrong direction, making public transportation less affordable and less accessible to those that need it the most.  She urged the Board to vote no and begin immediate conversations on an affordable, income based fare structure.

- Hanni Raley, The Arc of Aurora, is an advocate for the intellectually and developmentally disabled community.  Many of the individuals The Arc of Aurora serves are completely reliant on government assistance, are low income and completely reliant on public transportation.  They have been reminding the community that without transportation, a group of individuals that have fought for decades for community inclusion will essentially be re-institutionalized.  She stated that the community has been asking RTD to not institute a fare increase unless simultaneously instituting a low income pass and Non-profit Agency Reduced Fare program overhaul.  But, the Board has already heard this.  The Board has heard from the families that will be forced to decide between medical care and food.  The Board has already heard that paratransit riders already cannot afford the fare.  The Board has heard from College and EcoPass riders ready and willing to increase their fees to balance the increase.  She stated that everyone knows there are better ways to meet common goals and the Board has heard this; however, listening is not an outcome but the first step to effectively achieving outcomes with real and meaningful community engagement.  Hanni Raley thanked the Directors who are fighting for their constituents and been active in the fare study process.  She hopes the Board will slow this down so at the end of the process everyone can be proud of how we treat our neighbor.

- Andrea Chriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, is a transit organizer.  She is here to share the story of a 9 to 5 member, Claire, who cannot attend due to the curfew of her homeless shelter:

Claire was forced to flee her home with her son, leaving all their belongings behind, due to an abusive boyfriend.  Claire said that she stays at the shelter because she gets bus tickets.  If she leaves the shelter then she no longer has access to these tickets and cannot get to work or get her son to school.  She feels bad when she takes these tickets because it means someone else is not getting them.  There are many people that want to work but they cannot get a pass.  Clair said the system is not working.  There has to be a way so people are not always searching for the tickets.  Claire said she is begging the Board to vote no on a fare hike and come up with a way for her to buy her own tickets.  Once she has a stable job she would be proud to pay full price.

Andrea Chriboga-Flor urged the Board to listen to the stories they are hearing about what a huge impact a fare increase will have on Denver residents.

- Zoë Williams, 9 to 5, is a transit organizer who first stood before the Board on February 18, 2014, asking RTD to create an affordable fare and pas system.  She said that she did not know that a fare study was being launched but she knew that people were struggling.  The Board has heard testimony that the fare proposal is unfair, unjust and a significant burden.  This dramatic increase in fares comes at a time when one-quarter of workers in Denver earn less than $12 per hour.  She said there is a rental crisis in which monthly housing costs have increased over 11%.  Zoë Williams stated that without riders RTD is just a fleet of empty buses and trains.  RTD needs the community as much as the community needs RTD and it is shameful that the Board has forgotten that.

- Joe Thomas, Colorado Jobs for Justice, works with the working class people to help them improve their lives.  He wanted to bring the story to the Board from one of his members who is ill and cannot travel.

His member had an EcoPass once.  He was working at a job Downtown and his company paid for it.  He had enough money for food and medicine.  The EcoPass was a small thing but it meant a lot to him.  Then he got hurt and could not work that job any longer.  He was faced with the decision to get a job Downtown that paid less or at the DIA that paid more but he could not afford the fare to get to DIA.

Joe Thomas stated that there is a better way RTD can operate.  He noted that he has heard these types of stories so many times.  He expressed concern that not many Board members attend the public hearings and staff has not passed on the overwhelming consensus that the public does not need a fare hike but an income based fare.  He urged the Board to not only vote no on the fare structure because it is inequitable, but to listen directly to their constituents in the future.

- Reverend Anne Dunlap shared that she is a United Church of Christ Minister working on racial and economic justice in the Denver metro area.  She said that not only would the fare increase be a hardship on her family as they depend on public transportation but it would be especially difficult for low income people with whom they do their ministry.  She said that as a clergy member she is here this evening to ask the Board what side they are on.   Denver is becoming notorious for being an unaffordable place for hard working folks.  She wonders if the Board will do what is fair and just for those in the community or if they will make life harder and harsher for those that work so hard and make so little.  She encouraged the Board to vote against the fare increase.

- Richard Pollizi, Littleton, has lived in Colorado for over thirty years after coming back from a brief move to Chicago.  He expressed his disappointment that the law in Colorado does not prohibit drunks, prostitutes, pimps, etc. from riding public transportation.  He noted that young children ride the light rail and get exposed to all kinds of trash.  He believes that whoever designed the light rail did not have old people in mind as they have to walk long distances at the stations.

- Elizabeth Murphy said she works with Community Enterprise, a non-profit that works in South Adams County.  She recognized that the community is aware of the potential risks related to development around light rail stations, especially since the expansion is happening in low income areas; therefore, it is crucial that they are able to use RTD’s services.  RTD fares and passes are already unaffordable.  She stated that equality and affordability cannot be an afterthought.  She encouraged the Board to vote no until a low income pass is incorporated.

- Lee Ann Gott, Aurora, came to speak about the effect of the fare increase on people with mental disorders.  Her daughter works for the Mental Health Center of Denver (Center).  She said that when they were discussing the fare increases her daughter expressed her concern about her clients being able to travel to the Center.  Individuals with severe mental disorders often cannot hold down regular jobs but their disorders can be controlled with medication and support provided by the Center.  In order to get that support they must travel to the Center and they rely on public transportation for this.  She shared that their bus passes are already a big chunk of their monthly public assistance; not only will the increase be a hardship for these clients but may prevent them from going to the Center for their medication.

- Daniela Villareal, Aurora, is a community organizer with Rights for All People.  She is here to speak out not in support of the proposed fare structure.  She noted that she is not a rider of RTD but that does not mean she does not support those who are RTD dependent.  She believes that as elected Board Members they should be supporting the community’s best interest and increasing the fare is not fair.  She was disgusted to learn that low income riders were being called income challenged.  She urges the Directors to sit down and talk to their constituents that really need RTD to be affordable and equitable.

- Gina McAfee with US 36 Commuting Solutions, an organization of 70 private sector and 9 public sector members, echoed the comments of Mayor Applebaum.  She said that US 36 Commuting Solutions is very pleased to see how RTD has responded to the comments they submitted.  There was a great deal of concern about the first proposal having different fares for rail versus bus but the community is very happy to see that has changed.   She thanked the Board for listening to their comments and making modifications.  US 36 Commuting Solutions looks forward to working with RTD as we move forward with evaluating the Eco and CollegePass programs as well as the US 36 BRT.

- Maggie Gomez, 9 to 5, has been involved with many organizations, many of whom are here tonight, requesting the Board members represent the needs of the interests and needs of the community.  She pointed out that they have heard that SmartCards is one way to provide discounts but this is still not equitable.  SmartCards are not easily accessible for many riders but particularly benefit those with credit cards.  She encouraged the Directors to read through the 700 pages of public comment.  She feels that she has tried to contact her Directors but never hears back.  Maggie Gomez stated that equity and affordability cannot be an afterthought and non-profits cannot be shouldered with the burden of providing affordability.  RTD oversees a budget of over $500 million; if affordability and equity were a priority RTD could find the funding.

- Gretchen Armijo, Community Health Planner with the City of Denver, urged the Board to add an income based discounted fare similar to RTD’s current discount program for seniors, students, and people with disabilities.  She stated that access to affordable transportation is a critical element to community health.  When fares rise people are forced to make decisions between transportation, health care, food, etc.  She shared that transit riders get more physical activity per day, one of the most important factors in reducing the risk of disease.  This is important because in the City of Denver residents making $25K or less per year experience higher instances of chronic disease.  Low income residents often live in communities that lack resources that are critical to their health and public transportation provides them with a means to access these services.  She pointed out that several other cities have implemented income based fares and she urged RTD to do the same.

- Jackie Parkins, Denver, is an organizer with the Fight for $15 campaign.  She works with employees fighting for fair wages at their jobs.  She reiterated how many hours these employees need to work just to be able to afford the average apartment in Denver.  She knows one gentleman who takes the bus to the plasma center several times a week just to make ends meet.  She is here as a member of the community who is not income challenged but someone that cares about her neighbors.  She wants to see people able to go to work and doctor’s appointments without having to choose between that and putting food on the table.  She believes that the fare study is fundamentally unjust and wonders why some Board members ran for their positions if they do not want to serve the public.  She said that she is begging the Board to vote no on the fare increase.

- Martin Martinez, Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, shared that he had been hearing that Medicaid will cover the increased costs of riding RTD for people with disabilities but he is here to dispute that.  He works with the homeless population and has several clients that cannot use Medicaid benefits for Access-a-Ride.  He recognized the many people telling the Board the fares are unfair and a class issue.  He said they are just asking that the Board listen before they vote.

- Kathleen Bracke, Go Boulder Manager, echoed the comments made by Mayor Applebaum and Gina McAfee.  She appreciates the responsiveness and work done by RTD staff to address the concerns they raised, particularly in addressing equality concerns between bus and rail fares.  She said that her organization looks forward to continuing to work with RTD in refining the fare structure for the Pass programs.

- Robert Chase, Colorado Coalition for Patients and Caregivers, echoed the calls for an income based fare structure.  RTD needs to address fundamental problems with its mission.  Denver has delegated out essential responsibilities to organizations like RTD.  He said that FasTracks has failed in its task as many Libertarian critics predicted.  FasTracks is not a cost effective system that makes transit affordable in Denver.  He stated that RTD is raising the price the most on those least capable with dealing with the change.  He believes that RTD is lying to the public by claiming that the bus to Boulder is Bus Rapid Transit.  He thinks that RTD needs to rethink its entire mission.

- Erin Bennett, Denver, is the State Director for 9 to 5.  She wanted to share a story about one of their members who cannot attend the meeting because she is at one of her three jobs.

Her member has been able to survive because she rides buses.  She works at a fast food restaurant, coffee shop and baby sits.  Sometimes she rides six routes just to get to all her jobs.  Some days she rides her bike so she does not have to pay for the bus.  She said that she and her son barely scrape by because fares are too expensive.  She has called every place she can think of to see if they can help her with bus fare but none can.  She said that in order to pay for her apartment she has to work three jobs.  If the fare is raised she will not be able to afford to get to all her jobs and will have to move into a shelter.  She thinks this plan probably works for people that have choices and money left over at the end of every day but that is not her.  It hurts that this is how RTD treats the riders that are on the buses every day.

- Ray Lyall stated that he was speaking on behalf of those that are homeless in Denver, 42% of which are families.  It is ridiculous that RTD is going to raise bus fares.  He cannot believe that RTD paid $17 million to the Crawford hotel.  He asked where he could get an application.  RTD needs to do something that will work.

- Marcus Hyde, Denver Homeless Out Loud, helps run a Catholic house of hospitality for homeless in Downtown Denver.  He is watching a city that he loves get ruined.  He is watching rents rise at an extremely fast rate.  He is watching wages stay stagnant.  He is watching elected officials pretend to listen to their constituents.  Every morning he watches the homeless people he works with get up and stand in line to see if they have won the lottery for bus tickets.  Then, he watches those that did not win the lottery pan handle to try to ride the bus to human services to see if they can get tickets.  He said that maybe the Directors do not see this and are insulated from it but he sees this every day.  He stated that what he does know is that if he was making it harder for homeless people to work or move into housing then someone should fire him.  He suggested the Directors think to themselves “am I making life easier?”  If they are going to raise fares then he expects to see them doing something productive as well like advocating for a raise in minimum wage or rent control.

- Carrie Craig, Denver, is a program coordinator for Colorado Coalition for the Homeless.  Her organization does participate in the non-profit reduced fare program; however, they spend a significant portion of their grant funding on transportation costs.  This fiscal year they were hit with budget restraints that have caused them to reduced transportation assistance for their clients.  She does not see the current non-profit reduced fare program as a viable option.  For many homeless that are not fortunate enough to be in a program that provides transportation assistance, they often have to go to multiple non-profits and jump through numerous hoops before getting the basic need of transportation met.  This can be very traumatizing to their clients.  She recognized that transportation is often key to quality healthcare and critical for escaping poverty.  She urged the Board to vote no.  Fares should not be raised without simultaneously introducing a low income fare pass.

- Brittany Bollenbach, Denver, wanted to underscore that the only reason she is standing in the back snapping and clapping is so she can show her vote of support for those who are speaking.  She wishes the Board would allow for them to do that.   She is a recent transplant to Denver.  She shared that previously she served on the Board for the New York Public Interest Research Group so she understand how hard it can be to listen to public comments; however, she underscored the importance of the Directors at least appearing to pay attention. She uses public transportation every day.  After arriving in Denver and navigating her way through our highly effective bus system she thanks RTD for continuing to support the system.  However, it is imperative that the fares are not increased and that transfers are not eliminated.  She was recently laid off and recognized that it costs a lot to take buses to interviews.

- Jorge Jimenez, Denver, was here this evening to speak about his own personal experiences.  He said that he is fortunate to have a job even if it is low paying because it pays the rent.  He and his wife both have to work full time jobs in order to support their family.  He rides the bus every day for two hours each way.  He stated that this fare increase is going to greatly affect people like him.  He already has to allocate a large portion of his income to a monthly bus pass and will not be able to afford one if they fares increase.  He said that if he cannot afford a bus pass he will no longer be able to volunteer and support his community.  He asked for the Board’s help by not increasing rates.

- Regan Burd, Co-Chair of 9 to 5 Board of Directors, shared that she has been an RTD rider for over 10 years.  She is trying not to sound angry but that is difficult as so many people are angry that they must come before the Board begging them not to make this decision.  She does not think the Board has done their jobs and really looked at the proposal and public comments before them.  It is as if the Board is spitting in the communities faces being more concerned about clapping than affordable fares.  She pointed out that this is not the first time the community has come to the Board with these concerns.  It is shocking that RTD wants to pass an incomplete proposal that does not address the affordable fares that have been brought over and over to meeting after meeting.  She hopes the Directors that are planning to vote in favor of the fare increase actually listen to the members of the community before them today.  The Directors should vote no and go back to the drawing Board because they do not have all the information they need.

- Haven Rohnert, Denver, has been involved with the Community for years and recently became a lobbyist for the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.  He shared that he is a busy person.  He went to work, went home, ran errands, came to the Board meeting and will still have to stop at the store when he leaves.  He stated that the fare increase is unreasonable, but it is more than just about the money.  Three to four years ago he could catch Route 6 every 15 minutes and now it is only every half an hour.  RTD does not seem to recognize that people’s time is important too.  He is just going to buy his kids a car or carpool if this unreasonable proposal goes through. He said he is very interested to learn more about the upcoming elections and will not vote for anyone that approves the fare increase.  He respectfully asks the Board to consider the financial realities of people’s lives.

- Jenée Elise rides the bus every day.  She said that looking at the Board she does not see them on her route so it leads her to believe that they do not ride the bus.  She thinks the Board members do not see the young kids taking the bus home from school.  Raising the fares of those that are actually riding the bus is delusional.  She believes it is ridiculous that New York has lower fares than Denver.  She asked the Board to think about those they are affecting.  It is the ones who barely have enough change to get home as it is.  It is riders like her that are taking the bus, not the light rail.

- Mary Durant, Lakewood, is here as a community member and concerned citizen.  Over the past few years she has accompanied many homeless youth to court for fare evasion.  The court system was not designed to do RTD’s dirty work.  She said that these tickets can place barriers on our most vulnerable populations.  She has watched youth chose to pay RTD’s fare over medication and healthcare.  She would think that as a community supported entity RTD would be open to helping the people.  She feels that the comments that the non-profit organizations in the community should foot the bill for a low income pass are offensive and irresponsible.  She stated that RTD can either become a part of this community or brace ourselves for the impact of a relationship deeply torn.  The community will continue to hold RTD and the Board accountable.

- Hajar Ibrahim, Denver, recently moved here from New York.  She thinks that Denver needs to realize that if we are going to be a growing city we need to think like a larger city.  She has heard many touching stories this evening.  It is unbelievable the things people are going through just to get around.  She believes that everyone needs to reevaluate what is happening in Denver.  She asked the Board to think about people less fortunate then they are and the hardships they are going through.  She finds it surprising that the Board would consider raising fares when the buses are not even on schedule.

- Kenny Shepard, Denver, shared that he was in Atlanta several years ago and could travel for $2.25 throughout the bus and rail system.  When he was in Dallas it was $2.50 to ride from the Airport to Downtown.  He thinks that the airport fare is too high.  He asked security to go to the Auraria Station because people are not scanning their passes.  He believes this contributes to RTD needing to increase fares.  He wonders why it is taking RTD so long to build FasTracks when in other cities it only takes a few years.

- Jane Smith stated that she had been at the RTD headquarter since three attending two other meetings.  She said that she will try to be sweet rather than caustic but it will be challenging.  She asked for public comment to be opened again before the Board voted on the Recommended Actions.  She noted that she will come back at the next meeting to finish her comments if she gets cut off.  She has always been taught to bring a solution to a problem and she was here to do just that.  She pointed out that she was wearing a patriotic t-shirts that read “got democracy?” that was red, white and blue along with patriotic glasses with flashing red lights and a blue boa.  She will be speaking about public process.  She believes it is apparent that the Board and their predecessors do not fully comprehend how, nor are they willing to put in the effort, to see that public process is implemented properly.  She referenced the comments of former Board Member Jack McCroskey about his fellow Board Members that “they have never subscribed to the open government doctrine that sovereign citizens are entitled to look at all the facts, not just the pretty ones.”  Not only was Jack McCroskey censured for using profanity, he was also censored, which is a violation of the constitution.  This lead to a lawsuit that RTD lost to the tune of $175K.  She believes that many of the Directors are working toward the same goal and they should know who that is directed towards.

- Judy Von Gaia, Denver, finds it very interesting that so many people speaking this evening are doing so on behalf of those that cannot be in attendance because of the cost of taking public transportation or needing to be at their jobs.  She is a special education teacher that works with students with learning, cognitive and physical disabilities.  She would teach them how to take the bus to run errands, get to jobs, etc.  Very often these students do not have the money to afford to do anything other than take the bus.  She is concerned about their ability to continue to take the bus if fares are increased.  She has gone without a car on several occasions and only taken the bus, but she returned to using a car because the system did not work very well.  She challenged the Directors to only take the bus for a week or a month; while on the bus they can talk to the people that rely on the bus to learn how this will really impact them.  She thinks the Directors will be humbled to find out what people go through on a daily basis.

- Kathryn Fresquez, Earthlink and Bayaud Enterprises, rides transportation every day.  She was homeless for 8 years and struggled to afford to take the bus.  Now she is not homeless but still works with Earthlink, an organization that assists men and women get out of homelessness.  She said that her organization struggles to give people bus passes.  They partner with Bayaud Enterprises which helps, but it is still not enough.  She advised the Board not to raise fares.  It is hard for people that are mentally, physically and financially challenged.  She has seen homeless people not being able to ride the bus and going hungry.  She reiterated that the Board should not increase the fare.

- Susan Townsen, Denver, lives in the Westwood neighborhood.  Many of her neighbors do not have a lot of money to afford the bus, but they pay it because there is no other way for them to get around.  She is a widow that has had to survive on riding the bus because she never learned to drive.  She said that she pays for an EcoPass through her company but they are not sure if they want to continue offering them next year due to the fare increases.  If she cannot get an EcoPass through work she cannot afford to ride the bus.  She stressed that there are so many people in her community that depend on the bus.  She thanked RTD for bringing back Route 4.  It makes it much easier and quicker to get to work.

- Jeanette Vizguerra, Aurora, is a mother of three kids.  Sometimes she has to take three buses just to get from her home to her destination.  It is imperative that the Board understand that people cannot afford increased fares and it is essential that they have these services.  She feels it is very difficult to watch the Board sitting here, proposing a fare increase when RTD needs to focus on improving our services.  She also expressed concern that RTD does not provide change if the customer does not have the exact fare.  She stated that a fare increase does not help anyone.

- Maricruz Herrera, Denver, asked the Board to take into consideration the Hispanic community.  She has really been trying to listen to everything that has been said but she has had a hard time because it was not a good translation.  She believes that those that need translation should also get additional time to speak.

She is here as a representative of the Westwood Unidos Community.  The community is grateful that RTD returned Route 4.  The community felt that RTD really took the time to listen and work to meet the needs of the community.  She hopes in this situation RTD can do the same and really consider what they are presenting.  If RTD increases the fares it will be too high.  She asked the board to listen to the community again like they did with Route 4.

- Dana Nobles lives in transitional housing.  She agrees with the previous speaker that it is not very equitable that people that need translation only get three minutes to speak as well.  She believes the Board should double that time.  She reminded the Board that she has spoken to the before about what transportation means to her.  It is a lifeline to the community and imperative for people to survive.  She describes transportation as a puzzle piece; a person needs all the pieces to fit together to gain economic security and the pieces do not fit without transportation.  She shared that she was able to buy a car from her mom and the cost of that car is the same, if not cheaper, than bus fares now.  There is a problem with that, especially when you look at the burden of riding transit.  She believes that RTD views itself as a for profit business but we are not.  She is disappointed that the Directors were not at other meetings as she would have loved to see them there listening.  It is unfortunate that this is the first time the Directors are listening.  She said that the Directors need to listen to what the public is saying or they will vote them out.

- Dawn Howard, Denver, shared that she is in a unique situation because she has a neurological disability but she does not qualify for a discount pass.  Her concern is for the other people in her life that depend on public transportation.  She is a community organizer for the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition.  She stated that many people with disabilities live in poverty.  She asked the Board to think about what their life would be like if every time they wanted to go somewhere they had to make the decision between having dinner or driving your car.  It is about someone’s quality of life and being able to get together with friends.  She asked the Directors to think about the percentage of their salary they spend on transportation and to try to have some compassion.  She implored the Directors to think hard about their decision because people want the ability to have real, robust lives, friends, dinners out, etc.  She encouraged the Directors to vote no.

- Cesar Gevert, Arvada, said that like many of the Directors he does not ride RTD.  He takes public transportation in places like London and Paris, but there the fares are more affordable.  He was raised with wealthy parents.  He had lived in 13 different countries and speaks 5 different languages; however, he has only found poverty in the US.  That is when he made the decision to begin working with the poor.  He said that often he has to hold back tears because of the difficulty of their lives.  He believes that many of the Directors will vote for the fare increase.  He does not think they will listen to what the public is saying.  He stated that each Director that votes yes will be shameful.  The legacy that they leave for their children will be a legacy of shame.

- Julie Bennett said that she is homeless.  She stated that the community needs an income based fare rather than raising it.  If RTD wants more ridership we need to lower prices.  She asked every Director to walk up and down the 16th Street Mall and see the struggle she sees every day.  She said there are people walking 20 and 30 miles a day if they are not lucky enough to get bus tickets.  She wonders how they are supposed to get to and from work when they spend so much of their time trying to get help with their bus fare.  People would rather be working, not chasing down bus fare.  She told the Directors to go outside and look at what is going on in RTD’s neighborhood.  If any of the Directors vote yes they should be fired.

- Debbie Brady said that she lives on a very limited income.  She reminded the Directors that they are all public officials working for a publicly financed institution.  RTD gets most of its money from the taxpayers.  She asked the Board to prove to her that they were actually paying attention and not just giving lip service to this public hearing.  She reiterated that people will be hurt by this fare increase.  She said she will vote against every member of the Board that votes for the fare increase.

- Mary Anna Thompson, Denver, shared that she came to Denver four years ago as a nurse.  She came to Denver thinking she could experience four seasons and contribute to her community.  She said when she first came her she thought she was in a third world country.  Now she is in transitional housing and uses public transportation.  She stated that there are a lot of people that do not have $2.25 to ride the bus but they need to get to The Gathering Place because they have not eaten.  She wonders if the fare increase really makes sense.  She said that having to continually ask bus passes is humiliating.

- Bob Wilson, Arvada, came to this meeting to hear the stories and know what is going on.  He recognized that the Board has a very difficult issue in front of them.  They have heard the heartfelt need of the community on one hand but on the other is the big picture of keeping the buses running.  The Board has to balance between these issues.  He shared that he was moved by what he heard but RTD does not help people if RTD cuts service.  He encouraged staff to push forward with SmartCards.  He also asked staff to continue working on a subsidized fare structure, even if it is imperfect.  He thanked the Board for listening to everyone.  He knows that they are caring people.

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen thanked everyone for their participation in the democratic process.  He called for a brief break at 7:53 p.m.

### E. January 2016 Recommended Fare Policy Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approves the recommended fare policy changes, as outlined in Attachment A, to take effect beginning January 1, 2016.

Motion:              Director Lubow made the motion to approve the January 2016 recommended fare policy changes.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Following some audience disruption that resulted in some members of the audience being escorted out, the following discussion occurred.

Director Francone thanked the public for their participation.  She stated that the Board members had listened with keen ears to their issues and requested they would give equal consideration to what the Board members had to say.  She stated there were several assumptions made by some of the speakers that were               not correct:

- The non-profit are footing the bill for the low income pass program

- Directors do not use public transportation

- Directors do not listen and did not attend the fare study meetings

- The use of the term “income challenged”.  She is sorry that this may have offended some of them but she noted that several of the speakers referred to themselves as income challenged.  She would love to know what the proper reference should be.

Nevertheless, there were some valid points made around some of the issues with service, and the fare study being incomplete.  We are continuing to grapple with some of these issues.  In the next phase, staff will be addressing some of the issues raised.  Right now, what we need to do is get the infrastructure in place on which to build.  Staff will continue to work with such groups as Mile-High Connects on affordable fare structure options.

Director Solano stated he feels the new fare structure proposal leaves out the disenfranchised and transit dependent.  As a public servant, we need to listen to the people.  His constituents are saying this will hurt them.  He will be voting no.

Director Lubow expressed appreciation to the public and all of them who provided comments. She feels this is democracy in action.  She will be voting yes tonight. This does not mean that she not care for all the heartfelt stories and comments that were made about the hardship; it is hard to move forward when 50% of our riders are low income.  We need money to leverage.

RTD has tried to address this crisis.  The transfers have been reinstated albeit by the Smart Cards; she has learned that a person purchasing a single local fare with a Smart Card is only paying 10 cents more.  When you consider that RTD has deferred fare increases for about 5 years, the bottom line is we have to keep the buses running.  We will continue to listen and work with the appropriate organization for possible solutions.

Director Lasater stated that when he joined this Board a few years back he walked into a hornet’s nest of cutting service.  His District was hit hard and received limited or no service. RTD looks at our service needs holistically.  We have some very old fleet that breaks down and takes forever for the constituents to get home.  He recently rode an express from Thornton to Aurora where his wife teaches at one of the most deprived schools.  They created a “books and toys for boys and girls” because many of these students could not afford books.  Their parents were transit users and could not afford to get around.  He understands firsthand the impact of this on families and children.  However, we still need to set the foundation first.  The Board will continue to work with staff on this issue.  We need to be as self-sufficient as possible.  He has a blind gentleman in his district who actually lost service.  The proposal we are considering will at least keep service in place.

Director Walker stated that he grew up riding the bus system since he was ten and understands the challenges of being poor.  His household consisted of seven people who had to share, among other things, sleeping arrangements. RTD has to make some difficult decisions.  We need to choose between raising fares or cutting service. He would not want to leave anyone stranded.  His vote is a vote to not take away someone’s ability to get to work.

Director Folska stated that as a visually challenged person herself, she understands that transportation is critical to mobility.

Director Bagley reiterated that there are three phases to this fare issue. The first two are the fare structure and rates but phase 3 should look at things like the pass programs (EcoPass, neighborhood and low-income). This is really an issue of trying to have a balanced budget.  The first projected fare increase was for 2014 but has been deferred until 2016.  We have gone about 5 years without an increase.  It costs money to operate a public transit system and there is no such thing as a free lunch.  As compelling as the comments have been tonight, he thanks Director Lubow for her work with the Affordable TaskForce and thanks staff who will continue to work with this group on options.

Director Deadwyler thanked the members of the audience for their time spent in this meeting tonight.  She has a similar story as many of them shared-a single mother raising three girls alone. Even now for her in her District, she cannot use public transit to get home after 7:00 p.m. She cannot walk that last mile so she gets in her scooter and moves along.  It is about making sacrifices.  She understands the issues.  She wants to speak about the Access-a-Ride. We do not have the software to implement SmartCard on the Access-a-Ride vehicles.  Staff worked hard to come up with a solution where they are honoring the discount that the Smart Card provides with the Access-a-Ride costs.  As it is, the Access-a-Ride costs will go down, not up.  It appears that the income-based requests want RTD to execute but RTD cannot certify.  We are working with the non-profits to see how this can be done.  We need patience to allow the process to work.

Director James stated he has heard some passionate appeals tonight.  He has heard from many in his district. It is really a fundamental choice-if we do not have money to run the system, we must cut the service.

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen commented this is one of the hardest decisions he has had to make since being on the Board. He reflected on a similar discussion in 2011 when the decision was made to cut the service.  This is the first of many steps.  RTD staff is working with Mile High Connects and the Affordable Taskforce-hopefully we will be able to come up with solutions.  We all need to be part of the solution.

Director Folska thanked Director Walker for his earlier comments and indicated that she too could share a story of being a single mom who was visually impaired.  She knows there are a lot of people who are hurting in Denver.  RTD cannot be the solution to all that ails this city or nation.  It will take cooperation between many entities.  RTD will have a part but not all the burden can rest at RTD’s feet.

Director Solano restated that raising the fare rates will cause ridership to go down.  Lowering the rates will increase ridership.  This is basic economics.

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen called for the question.

Vote on

the motion:                The motion passed with 11 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Tobiassen, and Walker) and 1 opposed (Solano).

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. Fare Policy Attachments_Updated 5-27

##### b. Fare Study FINAL Recommendation May 27

### F. Videotaping RTD Board Meetings Board Report

It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to implement a system to audio and video record all RTD Board meetings, committee meetings and study sessions, and post the videos to the RTD website for public viewing. This action also approves the initial upfront costs not to exceed $25,000 to purchase and install equipment necessary to record the meetings. In addition, this action approves funding for a contract technician to facilitate the video recording at each meeting and an offsite contractor to provide closed captioning services. These services combine for an estimated not-to-exceed amount of $35,000 a year.

Motion to Table

to Date Certainty:              Director Bagley made a motion to table this item to the next meeting on June 16, 2015 citing 3 Board members in support of this action were not present.  There were also additional questions on how to accomplish, cost, importance, etc.

Director Francone seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director James inquired if there was any sense of urgency to voting now.  He was supportive of this action to table.

Vote on Motion

To Table to

Date Certainty:                The motion failed with 5 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Francone, James, Walker) and 7 opposed (Deadwyler, Folska, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Solano, Tobiassen).

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen declared the motion FAILED and went back to the original action.

Original Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve the videotaping of RTD Board meetings Board Report.

Director James seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater indicated that if we are to do this, it should be professionally done.  He had called the Castle Rock City council and they use 6 cameras.  He does not feel we can get quality using two cameras.

Director Folska called for the question.

Director Solano seconded the call.

Vote on Call

for the Question:              The motion to call the question failed with 5 in favor (Deadwyler, Folska, Lasater, Lubow, Solano) and 7 opposed (Archuleta, Bagley, Francone, James, Menten, Tobiassen, Walker).

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen announced the discussion could continue.

Discussion:              Director Bagley stated we are an agency with over a ½ B operational budget.  This proposal would be slightly less than 3K per month. He feels this is critical to promoting transparency.  We need to provide openness for people who cannot attend including some of the individuals who were not able to get here tonight.  We also need accountability for the actions of Board members and video recording would provide that.

Director Menten recognized that there are lots of elected officials who are activists and believe in transparency as she is one of them; however, she cannot support the motion in its current form. She believes we should consider putting audio on the internet and we can get this done at little to no cost.  She is willing to fight for audio.  Let’s look at having a stenographer to transcribe minutes and provide the audio recording on the internet.

Director Francone seconded Director Menten’s comments and stated that transparency is important.

Director James indicated he does not see a problem with moving forward.  What’s important is we get started and move toward more transparency.

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen stated that this proposal has the funds coming from contingency which he does not feel is a good way to respond. We need to have more conversation around this issue.  He is not sure which way he will vote.

Director Bagley shared that by tabling this, it would have provided more time for discussion and things to get worked out. This could be an issue of phasing it in cost effectively.  There is definitely a need for transparency, responsibility and accountability.

Vote on

Original Motion:              The motion to videotape the RTD Board meetings failed with 4 in favor (Bagley, James, Tobiassen, Walker) and 8 opposed (Archuleta, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Solano).

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen declared the motion FAILED.

## XIV. Executive Session

There was no Executive Session.

## XV. Old Business

Director Walker reminded the Board that RTD will be hosting the APTA 2015 Transit Board Member and Board Support seminar.  He shared that at previous conferences there was quite a show of interest from other Directors that want to see what Denver is doing.  He hopes all the Directors will support the conference because the attendees are coming to Denver to find out how we did it.  He is looking forward to a great seminar.

Director Bagley mentioned that he recently had the honor to accept an award from the Downtown Denver Partnerships on behalf of RTD as one of the four members of the Denver Union Station Project Authority.  He said it was his honor to accept this award but it is really staff’s award for their outstanding work on Denver Union Station.

Director James shared that he had the privilege of accepting an award at the same event for the Free Metro Ride.  He said this service will be a necessity when our new lines open in 2016.  It was a very enjoyable evening and for RTD to get two awards from the same organization just demonstrates the quality of our projects.

Director Folska noted that many other Directors were in attendance for the event as well.  She thought Director Bagley and James did an outstanding job accepting the awards on RTD’s behalf but she was bothered that no one introduced Director Archuleta when he was standing on stage as both projects are in his District.

## XVI. New Business

Director Menten inquired when the Board would receive the next SmartCard update.  Interim General Manager Genova responded that staff was putting together a comprehensive presentation for the next Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting.

## XVII. Adjourn

Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen adjourned the meeting at 9:15 p.m.
