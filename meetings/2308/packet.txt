Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A.
BACKGROUND
This action item discusses the financing of buses, light rail vehicles and related major spare components
as contemplated in the 2015 RTD amended budget and Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). The transaction
complies with RTD’s Fiscal Policy and is a continuation of the financing of the vehicle fleet update that
began in 2013.
DISCUSSION
The Resolution provides for financing of up to $230,000,000 for vehicles and related equipment as
anticipated to be financed in the SBP. Vehicles included in this financing include:

Vehicle Type
40’ Transit Buses
60’ Articulated Buses
ADA Cutaway Vans
Mall Shuttles
Light Rail Vehicle

Delivery of these vehicles is expected to be spread over the next 3 years. Equipment being funded by
this transaction includes major spare components for the buses and light rail vehicles listed above.

The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
certificates, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, continuing disclosure agreement, certificate purchase agreement and the Resolution

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

for issuance of the certificates. The CFO has also hosted meetings with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s
and Fitch to start the process of obtaining a credit rating for the certificates. The Board is being
requested, through the Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve
agreements required in connection with the issuance of the certificates.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the Indenture, Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, Preliminary Official Statement and Certificate Purchase Agreement are available
for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow as Bond Counsel in regard to the Certificates. The Certificates will be underwritten by a team
including Wells Fargo(50%), Stifel Nicolaus(22%), Bank of America, Merrill Lynch(10%), US
Bancorp(10%) and Harvestons Securities(8%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the financing are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2015,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A. This is
the recommended action.
Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2015,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A. This is
not the recommended action as it would not provide funding for the vehicle acquisitions previously
anticipated by the District.

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease, the Indenture or the 2015A Certificates shall be construed as creating or constituting a
general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or
requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year.
The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2015A Certificates
except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain
other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in
accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2015A Certificates shall
constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond
the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness
or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or
indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
2015A Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of
governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the
meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the
2015A Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond
those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2015A Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2015A Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2015A Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2015A Leased Property.
Section 9.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2015A Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2015A Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 10.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are

Authorization to Amend Contract with
NewPush for Expansion of Smart Media
Technology Hosting Service

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with NewPush to expand
Smart Media Technology (SMT) hosting services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by an
additional $1,440,000 to a total contract value of $1,729,500 and extend the period of performance for
the current and additional services for three additional optional years. The additional services are needed
for SMT stored value system security and high availability. Of the $1,440,000 contract value, the
Board of Directors approved $500,000 for these hosting services in March 2015 along with other SMT
items. The remaining $940,000 equates to $333,333 per year for the remaining three years of the
contract that will be funded in the 2016-2021 operating budget.
BACKGROUND
As the SMT program services expand and to offer Stored Value functionality to its riders, a considerable
set of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is required to be deployed and operational. To provide
what is equivalent to a debit card banking program, this necessitates a highly complex Data Center with
special attention to security, high-availability, communications, continuation of operations / disaster
recovery, etc. As example, the proposed architecture with NewPush includes twenty-one physical and
virtual servers in test and production environments and nine-databases. RTD and Xerox have been
working in concert to clearly define the physical and logical architecture, and other components
necessary for the Stored Value deployment and January 1, 2016 go-live. In parallel with many
competing demands, the provisioning evaluations and actions for hosting have been underway since the
fall of 2014.

More specifically the hosting, systems and subsystems must:
1. Meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.
2. Provide protected high network security standards because of stored customer information.
3. Provide high availability because if the system were to be down, it would be a major
inconvenience for riders and there would likely be a loss of revenue.
4. Operate with appropriate levels of security, encryption and availability by November 1, 2015 to
be ready for the January 1, 2016 Go-Live launch for Stored Value.

Packet Pg. 14

1.B.2

DISCUSSION
Three options were considered to provide the necessary technology infrastructure to advance SMT to
offer Stored Value to RTD’s riders. These options included:
1. RTD host at its datacenter
2. Xerox to provide the hosting
3. Current third-party hosting provider (NewPush)
RTD Hosting
Pro:

RTD would have complete control over all aspects of the hosting.
Con:




The current data center has significant power and cooling constraints that prohibit
additional infrastructure.
RTD’s current system will not pass a PCI compliance audit. So, without significant
investment in infrastructure and staff, off-site hosting is necessary.
RTD’s current availability and staffing will not support the desired level of operations.
Providing a system that would meet the needs would be significantly more expensive than
contracting the services to a third party.

Xerox Hosting
Pro:
 Contractually, Xerox was to have hosted the current system.
 Xerox has a series of datacenters offering the necessary services and infrastructure at the service
levels required for stored value.
 The SMT / Stored Value are Xerox proprietary systems. If they hosted, it would eliminate the
potential of operational conflicts or misunderstandings.
Con:
 The hosting called-out in the 2010 contract does not have the desired level of service to provide
the security and availability needed for the system.
 Xerox is likely to be an expensive solution and exceed funds currently budgeted.
 The current contract has federal requirements and it would be difficult to expand the current
contract to include the desired additional services into the future.
 We have worked with Xerox for months on planning the hosting services and do not have a clear
path forward with them.
Third-Party Hosting by NewPush
Pro:
 NewPush currently hosts SMT websites and banking servers under an existing contract that is
proposed for expansion by this Board action.
 NewPush has a positive and cost effective record with RTD in hosting elements of the current
SMT system. NewPush has demonstrated a high level of customer service.
 NewPush’s current services were competitively selected and this is likely the lowest cost, best
value solution.

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.2




Con:



The current scope of the NewPush contract includes hosting SMT servers, the ticket vending
machine banking server. Therefore, we know that NewPush already has completed a PCI
compliance self-assessment for RTD services.
Hosting with any other hosting vendor would create duplication of costs for providing high
availability connections, firewalls and auditing security of the system.
Having initially planned to do hosting with Xerox, there is insufficient time remaining to
competitively procure alternative hosting services in order to be ready for the January 1, 2016
anticipated go-live.
NewPush has hosting expertise, but not expertise for SMT applications. RTD will be responsible
for managing applications and Xerox will be required to assist with the migration.
The Board funded $500,000 for off-site hosting in March 2015. This is expected to cover
migration of the SMT system and the first year of SMT hosting services through February 2017.
Subsequent annual costs for SMT hosting are estimated to be between $350,000 and $400,000
per year. With full consideration of the options, it is in RTD’s best interest to move forward with
NewPush for off-site hosting services.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact. The funding for 2015 was already approved by the Board of
Directors in March 2015.
Subsequent years will be included in the 2016-2021 Finance and
Administration Department’s Information Technology Division operating budgets.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with NewPush in
order to expand off-site hosting services for SMT to provide greater security and availability. This
is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with
NewPush to expand off-site hosting services for SMT to provide greater security and availability.
This action would result in RTD continuing to host SMT services in house, exposing RTD’s
customers to risk of outages and greater risk of theft of personal information. This is not the
recommended action.
3. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Xerox in order
to expand off-site hosting services for SMT to provide greater security and availability. It is likely
that this alternative will not provide the necessary services in time for the scheduled go-live dates
and will require additional funds. This is not the recommended action.

Drug and Alcohol Policy Update

In an effort to maintain compliance with Department of Transportation and Federal Transit Administration
rules and regulations, RTD has made the following changes to the Drug and Alcohol Policy. All changes are
technical and regulatory in nature, and do not affect negotiated terms with ATU 1001.
1. PAGE 3, SECTION 1.0, PARAGRAPH 6
“This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 15,
1998, July 18, 2000, May 20, 2003 and July 2011.”
CHANGED TO

“This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 1998
July 2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013.”
This change is adding a date to previously approved review when updated time-frame was missed
unintentionally.
2. PAGE 4, SECTION 2.1, END OF PARAGRAPH 2
“Mass transit services” changed to “public transportation” to maintain compliance with FTA requirements.
This change is technical due to FTA requirement that directs recipient of federal funding to define the type
of transportation we provide.
3. PAGE 5, SECOND PARAGRAPH
First sentence has been updated with this month and year to accurately show most current safety-sensitive
job classification review period. Additionally, asterisk has been added to indicate status of “Acting”
positions in safety-sensitive job classifications. This adds another layer to confirm the inclusion of those job
classifications while the position is in transition.
4. PAGE 5, SECTION 2.1, COLUMN 1AND 2
After review and determination that no safety-sensitive functions are performed, as defined by the FTA, the
following positions have been removed from the list of safety-sensitive job classifications:

Thank you for maintaining safety as RTD’s first priority.

Policy.
6. PAGE 11, CHAPTER 4.1.1 “DRUG TESTING PROCEDURES”, PARAGRAPH 3
“…a second confirmatory test will be performed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GCMS) device.”
CHANGED TO
“…a second confirmatory test will be performed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GCMS), or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCMS).”
This change includes new technology that is being implemented in Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS) certified labs for processing of confirmatory tests.
7. PAGE 22, PARAGRAPH 2
“Mass transit services” changed to “public transportation” to maintain compliance with FTA requirements.
All RTD employees should be familiar with RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Policy, which is available on the Hub.

First Quarter 2015 Performance Measures

Board Meeting Date: July 7, 2015

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the First Quarter of 2015. These year-to-date measures provide
a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 19 of the goals in their entirety in the
first quarter. Overall performance improved over 2014. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.

Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q1, however, performance is
generally improving over 2014. Both Transdev (fka Veolia) and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal.
RTD and First Transit-Denver showed improvement over 2014 while First Transit-Commerce City was
down only slightly from last year. Regional and Express Service bus on-time performance also improved
over 2014. Staff continues to study the worst performing routes and identify the resources needed to
improve. As staff targeted efforts continue, on-time performance is showing improvement.

Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
In Q1, Average Cycle Time (the number of days between when a customer contact is entered for action
and when the action is completed/closed) was only slightly over goal of ≤ 10 days and improved over
2014.
In Q1, regarding Complaints Per Boardings, RTD and First Transit-Longmont met goal. Staff provides an
analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. We have seen customer
complaints increase across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due to several factors including the
fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, heavy/longer load times, TIC availability, SmartCards,
and the addition of West Line. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity
of these complaints and to work with operators to address the valid issues.

Goal 5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance

Packet Pg. 21

1.C.2

The ADA on-time performance in Q1 was below goal and at the same level as 2014. The ADA carriers
have found it difficult to hire qualified operators. Extra job fairs and advertisement efforts are in
progress. Note that data collection is being generated on-line and is more accurate.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus operators and mechanics and these vacancy rates increased
over 2014. We are experiencing a high level of vacancies in these categories and recruitment is ongoing. Human Resources has revised its hiring practices to include “one-stop” recruitment and the use
of outside agencies in order to shorten the hiring cycle. Vacancies are due to retirements, system
growth, and the strong local economy.

ECM Project Background
Financial Considerations
• Gartner estimates ECM can reduce overall
document-related costs by 40%
– searching for nonexistent information
– failing to find existing information
– recreating information that can't be found

• AIIM found that companies spend
– $20 in labor to file a document
– $120 in labor to find a misfiled document
– $220 in labor to reproduce a lost document

• These are hidden costs
– Reduce productivity and effectiveness of existing staff
