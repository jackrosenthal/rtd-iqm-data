BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed 2024 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal and 2025
Goal Setting Timeline

July 22, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Conducting the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) performance appraisal is a fundamental
responsibility of the Board of Directors. An annual appraisal must be completed per the Board’s Bylaws
and the employment agreement with GM/CEO Debra A. Johnson, entered into on September 29, 2020,
and most recently amended by the Sixth and Seventh Amendments agreed to on January 30, 2024
(GM/CEO Agreement). Additionally, on January 30, 2024, the Board approved the 2024 General
Manager and CEO Performance Assessment Framework. The Bylaws provide that the Chair and the
Performance Committee are responsible for the annual appraisal. (Article VI, Section 1 (f) and Article VII,
Section 5.)
As relevant to the appraisal process and timing, the GM/CEO Agreement provides:
•

•
•

•

•

By October 31, 2024, the Board will need to have taken appropriate action, relative to the
Board’s GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy, on the results of a total compensation analysis
conducted by an external consultant and presented to the Board for its review. Such review and
action do not require the Board to adopt any Adjusted Base Salary or other compensation
increase
GM/CEO Johnson shall have the opportunity to submit a self-evaluation for the Board’s
consideration prior to issuance of a final appraisal
On November 1 each year, GM/CEO Johnson shall propose any suggested adjustments to the
Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values or Goals, and the proposed distribution
between base salary and incentive compensation (Appraisal Criteria and Weighting) for the
following year’s performance period for the Board’s consideration
By December 31 of each year, the Board will provide an appraisal to GM/CEO Johnson; if the
Board fails to do so, she will be deemed to have met all performance expectations for that
performance period
By January 31 of each year, after consideration of and consultation with GM/CEO Johnson on
her recommendations, the Board shall adopt the Appraisal Criteria and Weighting for the following
year’s performance period; if the Board fails to do so, GM/CEO Johnson shall be evaluated and
compensated based on the Appraisal Criteria and Weighting for the prior performance period

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

In agreeing to the 2024 General Manager and CEO Performance Assessment Framework for the
performance period commencing January 1, 2024, and ending December 31, 2024, the Board adopted
an assessment framework comprised of four performance categories, grouped into short-term and longterm measurements:
Short-term (Annual) Performance Assessment
• Core/Base Job Performance
• Attainment of Short-term Goals
• Demonstration of Agency Values
Long-term Performance Assessment
• Based on Agency Performance Metrics
Short-term Performance
As contemplated in this framework, the GM/CEO’s salary adjustment is predicated upon an annual
performance assessment; for 2024, the GM/CEO’s short-term performance will be measured on a 100point scale:
•
•
•

Exceeds Expectations: 80 to 100 points
Meets Expectations: 50 to 79 points
Does Not Meet Expectations: Less than 50 points

For 2024, the GM/CEO’s performance assessment will be weighted as follows:
•
•

Core/Base Job Performance + Demonstration of Agency Values – 64 points
Attainment of Short-term Goals – 36 points

In order to maintain consistency with the GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy adopted by the Board on
September 26, 2023, the Board adopted a “pay for performance” structure pursuant to which the
GM/CEO’s base salary would be adjusted to reflect her performance during the current performance
cycle, as follows:
Performance Assessment
Outcome
Does Not Meet
Expectations
Meets Expectations
Exceeds Expectations

Range (points)

Subjective/Objective
Point Distribution

0-49 points
50-79 points
80-100 points

64 points/36 points

Adjusted Base Salary (ABS)
Increase
1.00-3.24%
3.25-5.99%
6.00-7.00%

Finally, while not contained in the GM/CEO employment agreement, the Board and GM/CEO have
committed to working with an external consultant to create and implement a 360° assessment tool to
be used in the 2024 evaluation of the GM/CEO. That tool will be developed in coordination with the

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

Performance Committee and GM/CEO in July, August, and September 2024. The survey will be
conducted in time to inform the Board’s final assessment of the GM/CEO. The 360° assessment will be
used to inform the Board’s rating of how the GM/CEO performed relative to the Core Base Job
Performance and Demonstration of Agency Values.
DISCUSSION
The objective for this Performance Committee discussion is to review and discuss the attached timeline
outlining the various deliverables and deadlines for all parties engaged in the 2024 GM/CEO performance
assessment and 2025 goal setting processes.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the GM/CEO’s performance is reflective of the overall performance
of the agency as a whole.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.

Short-term Goals
General Manager and CEO
2024 Performance Period

As contemplated in the “GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework” (Framework) initially presented to the
Board on Tuesday, January 9, 2024, the attainment of short-term goals related to the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan is
a critical element of the GM/CEO’s annual performance.
Included herein is a summary of the GM/CEO’s three short-term goals for the 2024 performance period, which are
directly tied to the 2023-2024 Strategic Initiatives:
• Back to Basics
• People Power
• Welcoming Transit Environment
The goals were created using the SMART goal-setting methodology, meaning goals that are (S)pecific,
(M)easurable, (A)chievable, (R)elevant, and (T)ime-Bound.
Under the Framework, out of a possible total of 100 Points overall, each goal is assigned a point value as follows:
• Exceeds Expectations: 12 Points
o Surpassed expected or established milestones/targets
• Meets Expectations: 6 Points
o Meets expected or established milestones/targets
• Does Not Meet Expectations: 0 Points
o Minimal progress toward established milestones/targets
During the GM/CEO’s 2024 performance assessment, it is the Board’s responsibility to determine whether and to
what extent the GM/CEO attained each of these goals as related to her overall performance. As written each goal,
if attained, would meet expectations.

Strategic Initiative 1: Back to Basics – RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications

and to redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset management
principles
Goal: To initiate the light rail replacement plan (50% of goal) by February 29, 2024, for the
replacement of aged rail along the Welton Corridor from 30th and Broadway to 19th Street in Denver
and complete at grade crossing rail reconstruction/replacement at five major
intersections along the corridor in downtown Denver by September 30, 2024 (50% of goal).

Background: In 1994, RTD commissioned its first light rail line for revenue service, the central corridor,

which extends 5.3 miles from Broadway and I-25 Station to 30th and Downing Street in Denver.
Recognizing the rail was installed prior to the opening, it is now more than 30 years old, and due to its age
and de-icing agents used on the downtown street segment, the paved section requires complete
reconstruction.
For purposes of this goal, the rail reconstruction/replacement activities will focus on planning for the entire
project as well as construction related to critical intersections within the Welton Corridor. This construction
will impact not only RTD operations but also vehicular mobility in high-traffic areas, including locations
within Denver’s Central Business District. As such, this work will require extensive coordination with
contractors, stakeholders, and local partners as well as large-scale communication efforts to raise
awareness of the impending work and to relay the necessity of replacing decades-old rail to ensure the
reliability of the system.
As the Board is aware, additional phases of this project will be necessary to complete the necessary rail
reconstructions/replacements, going far beyond recent targeted rail sectional repair activities conducted in
this same area in 2023.
Strategic Initiative 2: People Power – Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important

resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to recruitment and
retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.
Goal: To create, by June 30, 2024, an employee-centric culture framework that reinforces the
performance and corresponding cultural norms that directly align with the agency’s mission, vision,
values. Additionally, design and implement, employee retention strategies resulting in a 3%
reduction in voluntary employee turnover within the first 12 months of employment during the period
commencing October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior one-year.
period.
Background: In a year-to-year comparison of 2022 to 2023, the agency has seen an increase in the number
of applicants and a decrease in vacancies across core frontline classifications; however, retention of those
newly hired employees is less than desirable as nearly one-fifth of newly hired employees are separating
from the agency within one year.

1.D.1.c

Strategic Initiative 3: Welcoming Transit Environment – RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and

Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve community and
employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and vehicles.

Goal: To vigorously pursue the passage of legislation during the 2024 regular legislative
session regarding enhanced penalties for assaults on transit workers (50% of goal) and, by end of
April 30, 2024, develop a project plan to secure the perimeter of one major operational facility
and implement enhancements by November 1, 2024 (50% of goal).
Background: In the 2023 Employee Ownership Survey 45% of those employees’ survey agreed or strongly
agreed that “I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment.” Hence, that translates to most
employees including represented and non-represented alike feeling that they will be a victim of crime while
performing their job duties at an RTD facility or on a vehicle.
Noting that that adoption and enactment of legislation is within the purview of Colorado General Assembly
and the Governor, respectively, to meet expectations regarding the first portion of this goal, the GM/CEO
will demonstrate concrete steps taken to advocate on behalf of transit workers in order to positively
influence the legislative decision-making process.
For purposes of the portion of this goal related to perimeter enhancements, “major operational facility”
means one of the agency’s divisional locations from which revenue services are deployed and/or vehicles
are maintained, e.g., the Elati Light Rail Division located in Englewood and the East Metro (Bus) Division
located in Aurora. “Major operational facility” does not include administrative facilities, such as the Blake
Street Offices, or transit stations/mobility hubs, such as Denver Union Station.

Amendment to the General Manager and CEO’s (GM/CEO) employment agreement. The amendment
requires the Board, no later than October 31, 2024, to “retain an external consultant to conduct a total
compensation study (“Total Compensation Study”) and take appropriate action consistent with the
Compensation Philosophy adopted by the Board on September 26, 2023. Such Board action includes a
review of the Total Compensation Study findings and recommendations, review of the applicability of
the Compensation Philosophy principles, consideration of any information provided by the GM/CEO
Johnson, and consultation with GM/CEO Johnson prior to the Board taking any action. Such review and
action does not require the Board to adopt any Adjusted Base Salary or other compensation increase.”
Also on January 30, 2024, the Board approved the 2024 General Manager/CEO Performance
Assessment Framework. The approved framework was developed in conversations between immediate
past Chair Lynn Guissinger, current Chair Erik Davidson, the Performance Committee, the Executive
Committee, the Chief People Officer (CPO), and GM/CEO Johnson. Throughout those conversations a
consensus was reached to retain an external consultant to work with the GM/CEO and the Performance
Committee to develop and conduct a 360° assessment of the incumbent in the GM/CEO position.
Following the January 30, 2024, actions by the Board, the Board Office worked with the CPO and the
Contracting and Procurement Division to solicit, via a request for quotes, qualified firms to conduct
either or both the Total Compensation Study and the 360° Assessment. On July 9, 2024, RTD entered
into an agreement with RKL Virtual Management (RKL) to both conduct the Total Compensation Analysis
as well as develop and conduct the 360° assessment.
DISCUSSION
RKL Virtual Management will introduce their project team, then briefly introduce each of the project
components (Total Compensation Study and 360° Assessment) and their timelines before soliciting the
Board’s, as well as, the GM/CEO’s input on essential elements related to the projects.

Packet Pg. 37

1.D.2

For the Total Compensation Study, RKL will recommend and seek input on a list of comparator
organizations as well as the criteria for selecting these organizations. Additionally, RKL will seek input on
the contents of the total compensation survey shared with the comparator organizations.
For the 360° Assessment, RKL will outline best practices and recommend a defined purpose and
approach to conducting the assessment. Additionally, RKL will seek initial input on the evaluators to
participate in the assessment and detail its approach to developing and implementing the assessment.
This discussion aligns with all four strategic priorities (Customer Excellence, Community Value,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success) and reinforces the direct connection between the
GM/CEO’s performance and the agency’s success in accomplishing its strategic priorities.

Recommended Comparators
Potential Outliers
•

Valley Metro – does not include Bus as a mode of transportation offering, population per sq. mile is high in comparison to other
peers (11,116 per sq mile) and operating expense per VOM is low in comparison to other peers ($84,522 per VOM). However,
this was a comparator in the 2022 study and a possible survey participant.

•

San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) - Population per sq. mile is high in comparison to other peers (17,199
per sq. mile). However, this was a comparator in the 2022 study and a possible survey participant.

•

Chicago Transit Authority – main modes are bus and heavy rail, and population per sq. mile is high in comparison to other peers
(10,347 per sq. mile). Was a comparator in the 2022 study; however, likely did not respond to the survey.

•

Metropolitan Council (Metro Transit) – Operating expense per VOM is low in comparison to other peers ($173,851 per VOM).
Was not a comparators in the 2022 study.

•

Miami-Dade Transit (MDT) – Population per sq. mile is high in comparison to other peers (8,829 per sq. mile). Was not a
comparators in the 2022 study.

•

Transdev – private organization, operates in 46 states, plus DC and Puerto Rico, service per sq. mile and operating expense per
VOM information was not available. Annual revenue is more in line with RTD than other private transportation companies.

please let us know.
• We recommend transparency in our communications with
comparators. Are you comfortable with us sharing that we
are performing the total comp survey on behalf of RTD?
• We recommend providing aggregated survey results to
participating organizations as incentive to participate. Is
this acceptable?

Defining Purpose
Best Practice
•

Purpose and how results will be interpreted/used should
be communicated to all participants beforehand
(Maylett, 2009)

•

360 assessment participants (raters) are more likely to
provide honest feedback if they are aware it is for
developmental purposes

•

Employees are more receptive to feedback intended to
us for developmental purposes (Maylett, 2009)

•

Feedback for development purposes reduces implicit or
explicit deals (high performance ratings in exchange for
something) or concerns over retaliation (Baroda et al.,
2012)

RTD’s (Recommended) Purpose
•

Measure competencies as described in the GM/CEO’s job
description, GM/CEO goals and organizational values.

•

Utilize for developmental purpose – a source of
additional feedback during the GM/CEO’s annual
performance appraisal process

•

The results of the 360 assessment should inform RTD’s
current process for merit increase/bonus allocations

Does our recommended purpose align with your
original intentions?

PA G E 21

Identifying Participants (Raters)
Best Practice

RTD’s (Recommended) Raters

•

Typical participants: manager/supervisor, peers, direct
reports, self

•

•

Use a small but relevant rater group (Maylett, 2009).
Participants should work directly with individual being
evaluated and be well positioned to have observed
behaviors being evaluated

Recommend sourcing feedback from various types of
sources: manager/supervisor, peers, direct reports, and
self

•

After defining purpose and evaluation components,
decide who may be best suited to provide input on the
GM/CEO’s performance

•

Ideally, choose between 8 and 10 raters

•

Consider a personal invitation from the GM/CEO as
invitation to serve as a rate

•

Recommendations on number of raters varies within the
literature. Hansel et al., 2010 recommend at least six
peer/direct report raters to one supervisor to achieve
statistically reliable results.

Does our recommendations align with expectations?
