We are writing in support of the staff recommendation to award a design/build contact to Graham,
Balfour Beatty, Hammon Contractors to serve as the contractor for the North Metro Rail Line project
from Denver Union Station to 124th Ave. with an option to extend to 1 62~ Ave. as funds become
available.
The Committee congratulates RTD staff on a thorough and inclusive process. We are encouraged by
the high level of collaboration and s akeholder involvement which resulted in both RTD staff and
the Stakeholder Evaluation Team independently reaching the same recommendation.
RTD also should be commended for its desire to seek out innovations from the industry to complete
the FasTracks program as soon as possible, as well as for numerous early action items related to the
North Metro Rail Line that have resulted in considerable future costs savings to the project.
FasTracks plays a central role in ensuring the economic vitality of the region, in addressing future
air-quality issues and in influencing land-use decisions, but only if the plan is delivered in its
entirety. The award of this contract is an important step to ensuring the North area shares in these
benefits.
Finally, regarding the overall FasTracks program, we wish to reiterate our belief that maintaining a
regional perspective and vision remains the most critical challenge facing RTD. We look forward to
the final results of the NAI’.4S study and the regional discussion that will follow to find a feasible
path forward to completing FasTracks.
Sincerely,
FASTRACKS CITIZENS ADVISORY COMMITrEE

Approval of Contract Award to Graham,
Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors for the
Design and Construction of the North Metro
Rail Line Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors ("Board")
authorize the General Manager to award the design/build contract and negotiate final terms with
Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail
Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to
162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum
amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to
124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and Intergovernmental
Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue within
the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other contributions and to increase
the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work. The General Manager will
also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and issue a notice to proceed
for that phase, should funding become available. This option would be presented to the board through
the annual budget appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) of an
amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the Project scope as
described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks
program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks program. It also
provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a
later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek innovative
approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013 GM Task Goal
#1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state, and federal stakeholders; and
Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state, local, private sector, and
other funding sources for FasTracks).

Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit dependents both temporary
and long-term, to key job centers and provides clean, safe, reliable, accessible and cost effective
transportation in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in downtown Denver
and the Denver Tech Center.
The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and parts of Adams
County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and provides regional connectivity to a major
portion of the metro area, including Denver International Airport.

BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County. RTD has been working
closely with stakeholders in these jurisdictions to identify ways to expedite construction of this corridor.
Quarterly meetings are held and RTD and the stakeholders have been working collaboratively towards
this goal.
The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was conducted for the North Metro Rail line between 2006
and 2010. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the North
Metro Rail Line in April 2011. RTD is constructing the project without federal funds. The RFP for the
Project incorporated the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIS and these mitigation
measures will therefore be included as contractual obligations. Since that time, RTD has identified and
moved forward with early action items related to the North Metro Rail Line. These included acquisition of
six EMU commuter rail vehicles; design and construction of an expansion to the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility to house an additional 30 EMU vehicles ultimately required for 2035 ridership;
installation of duct bank at DUS for the North Metro line; contracted with AECOM to design the rail line
from DUS to 72nd Avenue; began the acquisition process for necessary properties between DUS and 72nd
Avenue; began the utility relocation process between DUS and 72nd Avenue; and performed work at the
Bambei-Walker Reservoir. These early action items saved considerable future costs to the project.
Most importantly, RTD concluded an agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad for acquisition of the
Boulder Industrial Lead, which is the right-of-way being used north of 72nd Avenue. The cost of this
acquisition was $117.8 million in 2009, which was a significant commitment of funds to this corridor.
RTD has also negotiated intergovernmental agreements with regard to North Metro with the City and
County of Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn, Adams County and CDOT.
RTD also has taken actions to provide funding for construction as it becomes available. In June, 2010,
the RTD Board programmed $90 million for the construction of the North Metro Rail Line from DUS to
the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) Station out of the $305 million pool in FasTracks funds
remaining from the Eagle P3 bids that were received below budget. In February, 2013, the Board
approved refinancing three outstanding debt issuances, and committed to use the future savings from
these refinancings to finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line from the NWSS Station to 72 nd
Avenue.
The current recommended action to build to 124th Avenue would not have been possible without those
RTD Staff recommendations and those prior approvals by the RTD Board. Approval of this action will
also require RTD to submit an amendment to the DRCOG 2035 RTP reflecting both the extended North
Metro Rail Line construction and operation and the significant schedule acceleration. Specifically, as

Packet Pg. 15

1.D.1

previously authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in February 2013, the 2035 RTP currently reflects
construction of the North Metro Rail Line only to 72nd Avenue by 2018. This action will significantly
accelerate and extend the North Metro Rail Line compared with the financial projections from February
2013. Further, this is being accomplished without impact to any of the other RTD FasTracks or base
system projects committed to in the current DRCOG 2035 RTP as adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.
Over the past couple of years, RTD has publicized the agency's desire to seek out innovations from the
industry to complete the FasTracks program as soon as possible. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum,
Transformation Through Transportation (T3). RTD's goal was to encourage and attract "out-of-the-box"
thinking that would generate innovative industry solutions throughout the District. As part of the T3
process, RTD revised and published its unsolicited proposal policy. The policy and effort as it relates to
the FasTracks program of projects has the objective of seeking innovation from the private sector that
will enable RTD to complete more of the FasTracks program, sooner than what is currently programmed.
In February 2013, RTD received an Unsolicited Proposal from Graham Contracting Limited related to the
North Metro Rail Line. In accordance with RTD's Unsolicited Proposal Policy, each submitted proposal is
reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the proposal has merit and is consistent with the
unsolicited proposal policy criteria.
In March 2013, following RTD staff review and evaluation of the Graham Contracting Limited proposal,
it was determined that it did have technical merit and the competitive process was initiated. The RTD
staff completed development of a design/build and financial solutions Request for Proposals (RFP), which
was advertised on June 28, 2013. The RFP was written in three phases:
 Phase 1: Design/Build from DUS to 72nd Avenue
 Phase 2: Design/Build on four individual segments from 72nd Avenue to end of line at 162nd
Avenue (72nd–88th, 88th-104th, 104th-124th, 124th-162nd), and offer financial solutions
 Phase 3: Design/Build and offer financial solutions for any or all of the three extensions (Central,
Southwest and Southeast Rail lines), or other potential projects
This effort is consistent with our Mantra to “Build as much as we can, as fast as we can, until it’s all
done”. The private sector has taken our Mantra seriously and has responded. The T3 process and this
unsolicited proposal effort for the North Metro corridor are also consistent with the guiding principles for
FasTracks.
 Ensure every step contributes to the full vision
 Focus money available to the greatest good
 Spend public money wisely
 Maximize outside funding before going to taxpayers
 Deliver key investments in all corridors
DISCUSSION
Following an advertisement period of approximately twelve weeks, RTD received four competitive
proposals for the project on September 23, 2013, from the following teams:
1. Bechtel/Herzog Joint Venture which includes AECOM and financial partner Societe General
2. Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) which includes Stantec Design, Parsons
Brinckerhoff and financial partner BMO Capital Markets
3. North Metro Transit Solutions (NMTS), a Kiewit/Stacy and Witbeck joint venture which includes
Atkins Design, Mass Electric, and financial partner RBC Capital Markets

Packet Pg. 16

1.D.1

4. URS Energy and Construction, Inc. which includes Lawrence Construction, Aldridge Electric and
financial partner Piper Jaffray
The RTD staff evaluated the four competing proposals based on the best value criteria established for
this procurement:
Financial
1. Design/Build Cost Proposal – DUS to 72nd Avenue
2. Design/Build Cost Proposal – 72nd Avenue to 162nd Avenue, scored by segment as defined above
3. Financial Innovation/Creativity
Technical
1. Technical Innovation/Creativity
2. Technical Approach
3. Management Organization, Experience and Approach
4. DBE/SBE/WIN Approach
RTD established review teams to evaluate the technical and financial parts of each proposal. In addition
to the technical and financial review teams, key stakeholders (City and County of Denver, Cities of
Commerce City, Northglenn and Thornton, Adams County and the Colorado Department of
Transportation) also participated in the evaluation. The technical, financial and stakeholder teams
presented the results of their evaluation to the Evaluation Committee.
Following the evaluation and scoring, the Evaluation Committee worked collaboratively and unanimously
recommended to the General Manager to select GBBH for negotiation of a contract.
GBBH submitted a proposal for the North Metro Rail line to 162nd Avenue, broken out by the segments
defined above. Based on financial capacity at this point in time, RTD is recommending awarding the
contract from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Given this information, GBBH provided a BAFO
price for a consolidated contract to 124th Avenue, reducing its bid price by $20.5 million from the
original proposal to issue Notice to Proceed (NTP) for individual segments. GBBH also provided an
option, with the price to be held for two years, that could be exercised to complete the North Metro
project to 162nd Avenue when funding becomes available. GBBH also provided option prices for the
Southeast, Southwest and Central extensions, subject to an escalation clause defined in the RFP;
extension of the North Metro line to Longmont; extension of the Northwest Line to 88th Avenue. These
options can be evaluated when funds become available.
The design/build contract initial Notice to Proceed will include the following elements from Denver Union
Station to 124th Avenue:
 Design, construction and testing of all Civil and Systems elements including the following
stations:
o National Western Stock Show station and park-n-Ride
o 72nd Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 88th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 104th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 112th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 124th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
 Interface, integration and coordination with the Eagle Project in design, fabrication and installation
of traction electrification systems, train control and PTC systems, SCADA and Security and
Communications systems
 Demolition of structures identified for removal

Packet Pg. 17

1.D.1



Right of way (ROW) management between 72nd Avenue and 124th Avenue.

The following basic components are included in the contract:
1. Payment Agreement for the Lump Sum Contract.
2. RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 23% for design and 21% for
construction, which applies to the total value of all work performed under the contract. The
contractor has committed to exceeding these goals by an additional 1% each. The contractor also
has presented a plan to include a minimum of 1% SBE participation.
3. The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a.
Professional Service – Goal 4%: Participants may perform professional services such as
design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration, easement
acquisition, and public information duties.
b.
Skilled Craft – Goal 8%: Participants should perform skilled construction related activities
such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic work, or similar
skilled construction work. Laborer activities will only be allowed if incidental to a higher
skilled journey worker status.
4. Davis Bacon and Buy America Requirements - The contractor will be required to use Davis-Bacon
wage rates and comply with Buy America regulations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
After review of the financial proposals, staff determined that it would be in RTD’s best interest to
finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line through RTD issuance of Certificates of Participation
(COP) with the North Metro Rail Line as the collateral. Staff modeled financial alternatives to determine
how much of the North Metro Rail Line could be built and operated within RTD’s current projected
financial capacity. The financial projections considered the contractors bid, RTD’s internal costs for
items such as ROW, vehicles, and construction management, future costs to operate the line, and debt
service on the COPs. In addition, the projections considered the impacts of an increase in COP interest
rates due to a potential ratings downgrade on RTD COPs. This analysis determined that RTD would
have the capacity to build and operate the corridor to 124th Avenue while maintaining the Board 1.2
times net revenue, bond test, and allowing fund balance policy.
Funding for this contract and the associated RTD cost of construction will be provided through the staff
identified and Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances,
potential use of the FasTracks Internal Savings Account, and issuance of COPs to provide $430 million
in construction funds. Separate Board actions will be presented for issuance of the COPs, and for a
reimbursement resolution if needed.
Funding of the North Metro Rail Line will not affect the planned financing or construction schedule for
other FasTracks projects. RTD currently has limited remaining TABOR capacity to issue sales tax bonds
or enter into other types of loan agreements. The North Metro Corridor is unique in that it meets the
criteria for RTD to use it as collateral for a COP at this time. As a result, RTD is able to finance this
corridor and conserve TABOR capacity for other opportunities that do not qualify for COP financing.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the design/build
contract and negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve
as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the
North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to 124th

Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this
proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and
Intergovernmental Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project
to 162nd Avenue within the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other
contributions and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project
work. The General Manager will also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd
Avenue and issue a notice to proceed for that phase, should funding become available. This option
would be presented to the board through the annual budget appropriation and with approval of
financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
direct RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) of an amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the
Project scope as described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks
program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks program. It
also provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be
available at a later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek innovative
approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013 GM Task
Goal #1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state, and federal
stakeholders; and Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state,
local, private sector, and other funding sources for FasTracks).
 Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit dependents both
temporary and long-term, to key job centers and provides clean, safe, reliable, accessible and
cost effective transportation in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
 The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in downtown Denver
and the Denver Tech Center.
 The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and parts of Adams
County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and provides regional connectivity to a
major portion of the metro area, including Denver International Airport.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead direct staff to negotiate a lesser scope with the
recommended proposer. This is not recommended. There is no guarantee that the reduced scope will
result in a similar reduction in cost as it would require a significant change in the proposer’s entire
approach. This option would not encourage building as much as we can, as fast as we can.

Packet Pg. 19

1.D.1

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a new
contract award to Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors. This is not recommended as we
would be giving up a firm, fixed price commitment from a contractor to complete a key segment of
the FasTracks program that is not likely to be available in the future.

To:

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs

Through:

PhillipVAWshington, General Manager

Date:

November 14, 2013

Subject:

North Metro Budget Authority

I have received questions from Board members regarding the recommended action in
regard to the budget and budget authority.
The total remaining budget is $633.8 million. This is the budget needed to build the line
from DUS to 1 24th Avenue. The $343.3 million GBBH contract is part of this total budget.
The breakdown of the total budget consists of the following categories:

Construction Contract GBBH
Other Construction
Right-of-Way
Vehicles
Project Management
Contingency
Total Project Budget
-

$343.3
76.1
72.6
50.7
57.3
33.8
$633.8

The recommended action provides for approval for the GBBH contract in the amount of
$343.3 and the budget from DUS to 124th Avenue of $633.8. As seen in the table above,
the $343.3 contract is part of this total budget.
The recommendation action also provides authority to the General Manager for the total
budget of $633.8 million. RTD has successfully implemented this approach on all our
previous corridor projects even prior to FasTracks.
Our experience on these mega-projects has shown that we need to be able to react quickly
to the intense demands of a complex project with quick decision-making and the authority
that is needed. For example, the vehicles are already under production and the additional

Our mission:
To meet our constituents’present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.

1.D.1.b

We have always committed to keeping the board informed on key project decisions and
financial status and the board has trusted the staff’s ability to manage these prolects
without requiring approvals for each element. It should be noted that if we need to spend
any amount above the $633.8 million for the project we would need further board
approval.
—

Fortunately, we have never had a need to seek additional funds for a major project and are
committed to that goal on North Metro. This approach is one of our key lessons learned
for project management and we hope that the board will continue this approach.
It should also be noted, that legally we are required to receive a separate, formal board
approval for right-of-way parcels to be acquired. We will be coming to the board
periodically in 2014 for these approvals.
If you have any questions, please call Rick Clarke at 303-299-2184.

time to seek approvals could cause us to miss a key production cycle with either the main
supplier or the many sub-suppliers.
