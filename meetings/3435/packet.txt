On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2022, the Board Office solicited feedback from the Board on which standing
committees each Director was interested in serving in 2023. The Board Office compiled responses from
the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 12, 2022 Executive
Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of Proclamation for Zero Fare for Better Air
Initiative

January 26, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
January 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the proclamation recognizing contributions to the successful Zero
Fare for Better Air Initiative.
REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the entire month of August 2022, RTD offered zero fares across its system as part of the Zero
Fare for Better Air initiative. This collaborative, statewide initiative, made possible by Colorado Senate
Bill 22-180, in partnership with the Colorado Energy Office, was designed to reduce ground-level ozone
by increasing the use of public transit.
DISCUSSION
Staff produced a report on the data collected during the Zero Fare for Better Air period, which included
identifying lessons learned and feedback from customers and employees. RTD experienced a 22%
increase in ridership from July 2022 to August 2022. Additionally, during the zero-fare period, RTD
customers and front-line employees did not report an increase in security incidents, and RTD operations
did not report any wide-spread impacts to service.
The Zero Fare for Better Air initiative was largely a success for RTD and serves as a positive opportunity
to partner with the State of Colorado, the Colorado General Assembly, and stakeholders who support
RTD.
Approval of this Proclamation would meet the Agency’s 2021-2026 Strategic Priorities of Community
Value and Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There are no financial impacts associated with this action item.

Whereas, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors appreciates the success of the
zero-fare transit services in August 2022 through the initiative Zero Fare for Better Air;
Whereas, RTD experienced a 22% increase in ridership from July 2022 to August 2022; customers
and constituents reported a positive experience when utilizing RTD services during Zero Fare for Better Air,
RTD Board directors heard from appreciative constituents, and front line employees, supervisors and RTD-PD
reported no significant increases in public safety and security issues;
Whereas, the RTD Board of Directors sincerely appreciates the efforts of Governor Polis, his staff, and
the Colorado Energy Office in supporting this plan to enhance public transportation in Colorado and specifically
in the RTD;
Whereas, the RTD Board of Directors offers a very special thank you to the legislative authors of Senate
Bill 22-180. The Board thanks Senator Faith Winter, Senator Nick Hinrichsen, Representative Matt Gray and
Representative Jennifer Bacon for sponsoring this legislation and for their continuing dedication to improving
public transit.
Whereas, the RTD Board thanks the Alliance to Transform Transportation which includes Denver region
CoPIRG, Denver Streets Partnership, GreenLatinos, Servicios de la Raza, Conservation Colorado, NAACP
CO/WY/MT State Conference, Colorado Cross Disability Coalition, SWEEP, Bicycle Colorado, ATU Local 1001
and NRDC. The RTD board also appreciates the support of Greater Denver Transit;
Whereas, the RTD Board thanks RTD staff members and our front line workers and members of ATU
1001. The teams worked in close partnership to make this initiative a success;
Whereas, the RTD Board thanks all customers who made the effort to utilize RTD services during Zero
Fare for Better Air and to those who continued to ride;
Whereas, RTD shares the commitment to the regional and state goals addressing ground-level ozone
and greenhouse gases, and shares the commitment to help Coloradans who rely on public transit to get to
their places of employment, medical appointments and other major activity centers;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT PROCLAIMED BY
THE RTD BOARD OF DIRECTORS
That Zero Fare for Better Air, and RTD’s partnership with the Polis Administration, members of the Colorado
General Assembly, and other stakeholders, was a success for RTD. RTD’s Board looks forward to working
together to expand Zero Fare for Better Air in the future.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Support of HB23-1101 - Ozone Season Transit Grant
Program Flexibility

January 26, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
January 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a support position on HB23-1101 – Ozone Season Transit Grant
Program Flexibility and to support changes to the bill to allow more flexibility that is in support of RTD’s
goals.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board-adopted 2023 Legislative Program serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals
related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be
adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be
communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
House Bill 23-1101 (HB1101) amends provisions enacted pursuant to Senate Bill 22-180, which created
a grant program within the Colorado Energy Office for RTD and other state transit agencies to apply for
funding to implement a minimum of 30 days zero-fare transit service for all services offered. HB1101
allows Ozone Season Free Transit Grant Program recipient to retain grant funding that was not spent in
2022 to be available for use in 2023. Additionally, HB1101 removes the requirement for RTD to provide
match funding for 20% of the total cost of implementing a zero-fare transit service period. This puts
RTD in parity with all other Colorado transit agencies which previously did not have a match requirement
during 2022’s grant opportunity. Finally, HB1101 clarifies that reasonable marketing expenses are
eligible for grant funding.
In August 2022, RTD implemented a Zero Fare for Better Air period, whereby the agency offered zerofare transit on all RTD services. Compared to July 2022 data, ridership increased 22% during the farefree period in August 2022. Additionally, the agency did not experience any major operational impacts
during the Zero Fare for Better Air period, nor did quality-of-life or crime related incident reports increase.
Lastly, customers and employees reported favorable responses to the Zero Fare for Better Air offering.
Staff recommends the Board of Directors support HB1101 in alignment with RTD’s strategic priority of
Community Value, RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers as well

Packet Pg. 29

16.C

as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth. HB1101 allows greater flexibility for
the agency to draw down and expend grant funding from the Colorado Energy Office grant program.
Further, the bill ensures that RTD is treated in the same manner as all other Colorado transit agencies
with regard to grant eligibility.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
At this time, passage of HB1101, as introduced, results in a neutral financial impact to the agency. Staff
intends to seek Board approval of a grant application to receive funding for a 2023 Zero Fare for Better
Air period.
