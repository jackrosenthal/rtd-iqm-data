It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.

## III. Activation of the GM Executive Search Committee

Chair Sisk indicated that the GM Executive Search Committee has been activated.  Their kickoff meeting will be on Tuesday, March 24.  We are working on setting a schedule for meetings and right now we are targeting 3-5:00 on Tuesdays.  He recognizes this is an aggressive schedule and there will be times when the full committee cannot be in attendance.  One of the first things we will be doing is assigning buddies.

Letters to the Senior Leadership team have been sent out inviting them to apply for the position of interim General Manager.  Our target dates are April 1 for a response, followed by the interview time with hopes to name an interim by April 10.  This is another aggressive schedule and will require a Special Board meeting for the full Board members to vote on the recommended candidate.

Director Bagley raised the question if the invitation was sent to any others.  Chair Sisk indicated the invitation has only been extended to Senior Leadership.  He noted it is appropriate to let the other interested parties know of the process.

## IV. Other Matters

- Paula Perdue shared that in light of the transitional changes, the strategic planning advance agenda has been changed to allow times for the Board members to discuss the attributes they are looking for in a General Manager.  The agenda will focus in the morning on determining the top strategic goals for the agency in 2016.  Assuming this deliverable is met, SLT staff will be excused around 12:30 and the Board will participate in a facilitated session on General Manager Attributes.  Chair Sisk added that the documented process for the GM Executive Search Committee provides opportunities for this input to be obtained from Board members as well as staff and other interested parties.  However, we are trying to be sensitive to some of the concerns we heard from Board members on Tuesday in making sure they had adequate input.  The Executive Search Committee will be putting a communications plan together on our outreach strategy.  Chair Sisk also shared it is a mutual decision that General Manager Washington will not attend this strategic planning advance.  Per the succession plan, the Interim General Manager Genova will provide the staff’s 2015-2016 challenges.

- Director Bagley inquired about the ongoing status of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.  One of the deliverables from the strategic planning advance is the tactical plans which are really the agency tactical plans.  Will this process be abolished for 2015?  Also, what are the plans for the evaluation process that occurs at the end of the year?  General Manager Washington responded that he had discussed this with his team.  It is important that the process continues and stays on track for the interim goals.  The “interim general manager” will need to be given more time to evaluate the tactical goals coming from this advance so he can prepare the next step of providing the implementation details.  There are a couple of decisions that will need to be made.  Will there be an evaluation of the Interim General Manager and how robust should that be?  How do we merge the goals that are established from the joint strategic planning advance with the attributes for a General Manager?  All of these must be a consideration but the need to move ahead with the process is important.   Director Tobiassen added that his concern is none of this impact on the budget calendar.

- General Manager Washington expressed his appreciation to Chair Sisk for his understanding and support relative to the discussions of his termination from RTD. He expressed that he had lots of thoughts, mixed feelings and sadness as he leaves the agency he has come to love.  He believes this the best agency in the country; we have accomplished some amazing things, and he hopes that we continue at the stellar performance on a local and nationwide basis we have achieved.  He was challenged from the Board when he accepted the General Manager position, to present and elevate this agency into one of the top agencies in the country.  He believed he accomplished this.  He has had an excellent team to work with and he appreciates the support of the Board and GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair Bagley.

- Director Bagley shared that they had held a SW corridor stakeholder meeting at the Mansion.  The wonderful RTD staff consisting of Susan Wood, Andy Mutz and others pulled together this amazing meeting.  Representatives from all over the corridor attended.  There were three Board members present, Bagley, Francone and Lasater.  Everyone was interested in how we work the $115M extension of the corridor.

- Director Bagley referred to his request to the Executive Committee for video recording of the meetings.  He identified three things that he stated make this more urgent than ever:  New General Manager, fare study and being only one of three elected Boards, the constituents have a right to know.  He placed an urgent request for this to be implemented sooner than later.  He thinks it is worth the $50K or so it would cost.  Director Tobiassen concurred that we need to move ahead.  Chair Sisk also concurred but stated since this was not on the agenda this month, he would like to have this as an action for the Executive Committee next month.  Chair Sisk stated that whatever we do, we must do it in the most professional manner possible.

General Manager Washington concurred and stated it must be done in a professional manner.  We may need to get 3rd party resources but he will accept this as a head nod for him to get his team to start the process for making this happen.  This includes identifying sources of funds and defining the scope.  Director Bagley indicated that ideally, it would cover the Board Chamber and the 3rd Floor Executive Conference room.  Director Walker inquired of the timeline and the plans to relocate this office.  General Manager Washington indicted they are looking at options but the plans are too half-baked to bring before the Board.  He anticipates at least 6 months before they will be ready to discuss.

Director Folska inquired of Director Bagley what is the plan for distribution. Director Bagley stated that his initial thought is streaming via web.  Director Tobiassen indicated there are lots of ways to do this including a YouTube Channel.  He believes there are affordable and reasonable alternatives.

Paula Perdue stated she is fine with these plans.  However, it must be very clear they will need to have their own resources and funds to provide this video service.  The Board office cannot assist in any way and is already overtasked with the work before them.

## V. Motion to Move into Executive Session

The Executive Committee did not see the need for an executive session at this time.  The Executive session was cancelled.
