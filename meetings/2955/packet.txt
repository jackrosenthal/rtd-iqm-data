top of the poor condition, the repairs are taking longer than they have in the past because
of the complete deterioration of the concrete structural sub-slab which supports the
pavers. Team has been working with the contractor and Bus Operations to complete the
repairs

Light Rail Transit (LRT) Bridge Deck Sealing: Provided plans, specifications and
contracting assistance for bridge deck sealing at two 1000-ft long LRT bridges on the
Southeast Corridor. This work is critical to delay deck walkway deterioration caused by an
anomalous occurrence at these bridges of chemically reactive concrete that swells and
cracks due to moisture intrusion. This project is also the start of a preventive maintenance
program to seal all bare concrete deck (as opposed to ballasted deck) LRT bridges to
extend their useful life.
LRT over Broadway Bridge Bearing Repair: Developed plans and specifications for bridge
repair to reset and restrain a bearing device that “walked” about 0.5-ft horizontally from
the installed position at the south abutment, apparently due to a design deficiency. The
work will involve raising the bridge at the abutment about 0.25-inch by jacking each of
the three girders simultaneously, using hydraulic jacks with over 100-ton capacity. After
the bearing device is reset a restrainer will be installed to prevent possible future
displacement.
Bridge Inspections: Administered bridge inspections by contracted consultant, including
regularly scheduled inspections at rail corridors and DUS, as well as initial bridge
inspections prior to opening for the SERE project. Ongoing throughout 2019.
Sheridan Garage Curtain Wall (W Line): Designed a curtain wall to prevent moisture
intrusion into stairwell. RTD and the contractor worked on submittals and shop drawings
for the new curtain wall system. The contractor received permits through the City of
Denver. Construction is now wrapping up.

Significant Accomplishments (Cont’d)
• The agency with Dave at the helm got the G Line through the FRA action plan and into operation. And it’s such a success
so far – is really appreciated in the communities/neighborhoods it serves. Dave’s willingness to pursue measures to
address noise impacts on nearby residents is much appreciated. Likewise the follow-up to carry the EAGLE through the full
action plan and beyond. As things have settled down, operations have smoothed out and become quite reliable. The
personnel on board are in my experience friendly and effective in preserving safety and collecting fares, and reports on the
internet and in the stats we report corroborate that. Other: the southeast rail extension, done in the expected
timeframe. The LiVE program implemented. The application and work to address PUC electricity rate structure. Our ability
to secure significant grant funding. The joint ventures with Uber and the Transit app signal RTD's interest in being part
of, getting ahead of, the evolution of mobility. This focus on and ability to negotiate and join with outside TNCs and
platforms toward these arrangements, appears to be a real strength for Dave. If this evaluation could be just about
these items, it would be a rosy one.

Significant Shortcomings
• Dave should feel free to speak up even more in Committee and Board Meetings to advance issues that staff has proposed,
providing a clear verbal assurance that the matters have been thoroughly considered and well-vetted and represent the
considered recommendation of both staff and him, assuring the Board that all necessary and relevant information has
been presented, without burdening the Board with the minutia of management details.
• Delayed Opening of N-line -Ridership decline -Operator shortage (suggest review of hiring beuracratic processes to
streamline, make website easier to navigate for hiring, reopen CBA, review supervisory behavior) -Unsuccessful resolution
of DTP dispute -Recent dropped trips and communication to passengers
• -In the northern part of the District, there is a significant drop in confidence in the effectiveness of RTD to deliver transit
service adequately. This has come from a variety of causes, all of which can and should be thought through and
addressed: • 1. The delay in the NLine opening and the miscommunication to the board and then a different message to the NATA
group the next day. It was embarrassing to the District and has impacted our credibility. I appreciate that there is now
direct communication going out weekly to the elected officials updating the progress on the project. 2. The National
Medal of Honor Museum was such an awful experience for the District. It felt as if there was communication with a select
closed group who promised the votes to both the Mayor and the Governor without including anyone else from the board
or the executive committee. I believe this event was damaging to our reputation and I hope we can regain that back. I
would suggest that there be no more back door deals and that those type of processes go before the executive committee
to determine strategies and inclusion of the board. If it is an issue in a particular district that the Director of that district
be included in those conversations. 3. Driver shortage and retention. I am both shocked and embarrassed by the
magnitude of this issue. As I have read through the material provided to me it seems that we have an issue of low moral
in our employees. This is an area of great concern to me and I am hoping that you bring in a 3rd party expert to do a
thorough evaluation of what is going on and what needs to change.

Significant Shortcomings (Cont’d)
• I've thought long and hard about whether the major issues RTD faces are merely a streak of bad luck and circumstances, or indicate
underlying and fundamental problems that threaten our mission. Very regretfully, I’ve concluded the latter, based on the following:
- A deep concern that we’re upside down on our finances, perhaps structurally unsound or at least clearly not simply responding to a
transient dip. That we’ve landed here at all is an issue of management. I have not seen the GM weighing in or apprising the board
about this issue. He has seemed disengaged on it. - That we’re at a point of desperate measures, when it is the job of the chief
executive to keep the agency from that point. - A belief that our financial circumstance has in significant part played a role in the
sudden decision to move forward with a radical approach to address operator shortages, one that we’re now under the gun to hastily
implement. An added concern stems from persistent applicant and employee reports and more that we’ve not done (still aren’t doing,
in light of the lag in our recruitment response and training/deployment capacity) all possible to head those measures off and/or come
at the problem differently. And even though the proposed budget does not now assume the savings, a concern about our lack of
honesty and forthrightness regarding its role in bringing this forward. - The delays on the N Line in the wake of problems on the G –
and that perhaps Dave (and certainly the Board) was unaware of delays with construction all the while reporting an intended ‘early
spring’ or even more specifically first quarter opening. The communications around the issue. Our regional credibility, already
flagging, has suffered another serious blow. - A growing belief that Dave, who has the right aim oftentimes, is not effectively
managing his leadership team. - That the organization’s actions, the lapses in communication and taking care of our riders, and
management’s recommended allocation of resources and time and effort has been at cost to our core mission and commitment to
keep customers front and center. - Likewise the recurrent reports and concerns about the organizational culture and regard and
treatment of our line employees, especially – and a sense that the manager is not assessing the situation and acting on it. - That
we’ve somehow cultivated a basic tendency toward resistance to ideas and concerns from the outside that don’t originate within the
organization. - Even if these assessments of Dave are unduly harsh, I believe the critical situation the agency is in, in combination
with the duty we have to riders, employees, stakeholders and the region as a whole, calls for a different executive leadership skill set
than we now have in him.

Significant Shortcomings (Cont’d)
• Communication issues in general between Dave, (senior staff) and Board members. While Dave is thorough in a number of
fundamental communications such as his weekly updates to employees and Board members, we seem to have lost ground
in general public relations positions with many of our constituents and the media. There was certainly a disconnect
between Dave and senior staff regarding the N-Line postponement. Board members (myself included) were taken by
surprise with senior staff hedging on the delivery date at a public meeting without any warning from Dave. To be
contradicted by senior staff at a public meeting is quite embarrassing and frankly, not acceptable. This is a big concern to
me as we move ahead with future projects. Also, it seems we have an ever-increasing creditability problem regarding our
labor issues. While I realize we, like many other entities, are a victim of a good economy and low unemployment numbers,
it seems we just can't catch a break from the media and important stakeholders as we work through this process. I
understand that Dave has 15 Board members to deal with, and I don't expect weekly calls or meetings, but is seems like
there is a weak linkage between him and I.
• Inability to solve operator issue that has plagued District for years Recommendation of substantial service cuts (failure to
provide transit) N Line delays Multiple litigation efforts and multi-million dollar legal expenses Inability to provide
creative solutions to problems’ Inability to improve reputation as evidenced by threats from multiple legislators to takeover RTD tasks
• Inability to solve staffing issues. Concentrate on retaining current bus and rail operators, plus place an emphasis on hiring
more female operators. We also need to do what school districts do for teachers, bring back retired drivers for part time
work.

Significant Shortcomings (Cont’d)
• Most significant is failure to find resolution in legal matters, in particular DTP and RRP. The other would be our
recruitment/retention of human capital. It's too late for improvement; GM has failed as a visionary in being prepared and
anticipating these crises. Now we have a budget crisis. Can't imagine why we've spend so much money on non-critical
things, and now we're in a shortfall. No good oversight of SLT. Failed agency by expecting CFO to be CIO and head of HR as
well.
• Must reduce overhead or the road is going to get much more rocky.
• Sadly, the shortcomings are equally impressive. The agency is literally falling apart - unable to provide reasonable service,
unable to retain employees, perceived as a dismal product, unpopular with those who legislate and those who vote. I
think that the concept of Reimagine RTD is the only way to go - and that may include removing many of the existing
standards and leaders. I would recommend that RTD move quickly (that's an oxymoron) to redefine the agency.
• The most significant shortcomings are - delay of N Line opening -

Significant Shortcomings (Cont’d)
• This is a difficult review to write. RTD is getting some good things done. But, the communication, budgetary, workforce and other
problems seem to be nearing crisis levels. The agency appears to have serious budgetary and financial problems. It’s not clear that
the GM is fully focused on those problems or on the partnerships needed to help relieve them. The workforce crisis has continued for
about four years. Mandating is a big concern, but recent statements from the union, in the press and from operators indicate that
there may be problems with hiring practices, with respect and with other elements of working for RTD that contribute to the
shortage. We need an overall plan to address the full scope of the problems and measure success. I don’t see the GM marshaling that
plan. It also appears that the budget is a piece of the decision to make significant service cuts now, although the savings from those
service cuts have now been removed from the budget. The agency needs to rethink the way it works with its local and state officials
and other stakeholders. Those governments may have or may be able to obtain funding to help RTD fulfill and even expand its
mission of providing quality, reliable service. The relationship continues to be one of RTD dictating changes without really working
together with our partner agencies. Our local elected officials continue to learn about decisions that affect them (such as the delays
on the N line and the new proposal to cut service) from the media, rather than from RTD. The GM needs to be setting a new vision
and tone on these and other issues. The NMoH museum vote, which has negatively affected confidence in the agency, was the
result of leadership not communicating or providing appropriate information to the board. That sort of politically-charged issue
should never go to the board without full information about its importance to our state and local partners and without knowing the
vote count in advance. The GM was meeting with those partners, who offered their help to get the votes needed. Construction on
the N line is late and marked by a serious lack of communication. These and other problems are contributing to a loss of confidence
in RTD by the public, local elected officials and the legislature. Again, this is difficult. The GM is a very nice person, and I believe he
is trying hard. But, I believe the board needs to consider whether a change is needed.

All need improvement.

•

I am concerned that the GM does not move the agency toward a more collaborative and
open vision. It seems that the GM does communicate regularly with his executive team,
but it is not clear that he is effectively leading the way.

•

I am sitting here with Channel 9 once again doing a story on driver shortage with two
options unreliable service or reduced service. I think we are in serious trouble with the
driver shortage issue. For me, this is the number one issue for the General Manager and
his team. If we cannot provide reliable service, there will be no RTD.

•

It appears that we may be forming a SLT vs. Board relationship which is a bit alarming. I
think Dave is probably aware of the unrest from our stakeholders regarding delivery
delays and service cut-backs but I'm not sure members of SLT understand the growing
magnitudes of these situations. The frequently common pushback from SLT members is
frustrating. I sometimes wonder if some members of SLT are a bit insulated from what
we are dealing with in our communities.

•

Mixed messages from leadership to Board members and local communities as evidenced
by North Metro Line opening message problems

•

The SLT may meet with the GM and communicate with him but the communication stops
right at that level. Mid level managers and supervisors at all levels and departments feel
unheard and unappreciated. The agency is perceived by riders and emnployees as being
in distress, and unfortunately, the buck stops at the GM.

own personal experience in interacting with transit leaders from around the

•

Mr. Genova and his staff have been called upon several times to address
national audiences and cross-disciplines on various aspects of RTD's
operations, such as PTC, governance structure, opportunity zones and
electronic fare collection, to name a few. I believe that Mr. Genova and his
staff are called upon so frequently because of they've brought the agency to
the forefront of integrating technology with transit. Also, Mr. Genova and
his staff are still called to present on FasTracks 15 years after the measure
passed.

•

Over $40 million budget shortfall for 2020 speaks for itself. Shortfall required myriad
cuts to balance budget.

•

RTD did not get to be in financial stress over night. This is a problem that has been
ongoing and is reflected in these goals. The primary goal of the GM is to make the
agency healthy, and it is not.

•

RTD has long lasting budget problems which don't seem to improve, suggesting we need

a structural imbalance between our revenue and expenses.

The agency is in financial trouble because of Fastracks. Hard to blame Dave for Cal

Additional Comments – Needs Improvement

•

Average citizen and rider has little idea of financial problems

•

Certainly, the GM and staff do some work on the items checked. "Meet" with regional leaders suggests that RTD should be listening and engaging their
concerns. I see examples of that, but believe there is much work to be done in these relationships and in our efforts toward collaborative communication. I
also believe that the information given to the board is often not sufficient for the decisions we are asked to make.

•

GM is failing to be a good leader to his team.

•

I appreciated the openness to listen to and support measures to address community concerns on train noise. More personal engagement would be really
helpful, in my view -- the GM with appropriate board members meeting with community officials and other agencies. When Peggy Catlin and I met with the
Jeffco Commissioners they remarked they'd like to see more. Yet when the exec committee urged just this approach for the proposed service cuts, the plan
introduced had a mobile lab instead. Generally, though this question addresses outreach only in a narrower sense, I am quite concerned that we are
shortchanging our responsibility to communicate with the people relying on our system on a day to day basis. Without intending it, I know, I believe it
telegraphs a lack of respect or concern.

•

I cannot begin to tell you how many times I found out about an issue through the media. It seems to me that the Board should get a "heads up" before the
media has the story on air.

Additional Comments – Needs Improvement

•

In the north, stakeholders and community members often have a negative view of RTD and the interaction is not positive. There appears to be a fairly
widespread belief that service is not adequate, and it would be very beneficial if there were an outreach program to address these negative beliefs and to
change this attitude.

•

Only met with GM to discuss on-going problem areas. GM still not proactive in this regard - meaning the burden is on the GM to reach out to Board members
to arrange regular meetings. The fact that a Board member can contact the GM to set up a meeting does not mean the proactive requirement has been met.

•

The Board was amazingly uninformed about the NMHM situation, and it is possible that there are numerous other similar situations that simply did not come
to light. The GM would do well to skip some presentations and meetings and do more identifying and addressing.

•

I truly appreciate Dave's willingness to meet with important stakeholders on a regular and "emergency" basis. As of late (especially), Dave has been present
to field questions and endure criticism from my stakeholders. And, I appreciate his regular communications efforts. No problem there. I just feel that Dave
could do a better job of communicating with Board members on big or late-breaking issues. I appreciate a no surprises philosophy. When I am contradicted
by staff members at a public meeting with no warning from Dave it is a problem. Additionally, we certainly could have avoided a media mess on the Medal of
Honor issue with more information and not having an apparent assumed outcome. While I certainly appreciate that Dave is extremely busy it sometimes
seems that Board communications outside the established routine are often after-the-fact and damage control.

The GM excels at all tasks that are safety and security related. That
is truly his area of expertise. Perhaps he should go to work for a
safety and security firm. RTD is a transportation agency and
although it is true that we should always strive to be safe, that is not
our priority. Our priority is providing adequate service to our riders.

Additional Comments – Needs Improvement
•

Currently the item checked seems to be reactive more than proactive. It was difficult to mark the GM down on this, as he has met or exceed the other components of this goal. Never-theless, it has definitely left a black eye on the agency.

•

For me the issue is with the low moral of our employees which is causing our inability to provide reliable service to the community.

•

Here we have the same issue - the goals are not" maintain an adequate workforce" - the goals are " monitor" -"conduct awards and appreciation events". There are a lot of staff who might
reasonable be expected to have these goals, but the GM needs to have concrete measurable performance goals that address the health of the agency and the quality of the service that it
provides. I hope that all succession and leadership plans are current. This is not a problem that began this year - this is an ongoing failure of the head of the agency.

•

The experience with the operator shortages on light rail right now is what dominates in my review of this item -- but still seeking info (know some is coming at some point) and concerned
about whether we've become top heavy and how we determine and assure our compensation plan is appropriate, among other items. In addition, what we hear about our HR capability and
response, and meeting the needs of the organization in staffing and development, is troubling for sure. Again, we don't have much to go on in this.

•

The failure to retain employees is leading to a proposal or significant service reductions. The union believes the stated reason of mandated overtime is not the sole issue. Whatever the true
issue, the responsibility to correct this problem lies solely with the GM.

•

The GM does a good job with employee recognition. I can't really judge the training and development programs. The two items regarding workforce (work group and incrementally
optimizing service) suggest incremental changes and successes. The board was getting information that the problem was getting better until the service cuts were proposed in a rather
precipitous way. I also did not think we were given the information needed to decide the pension issue.

•

Total failure.

•

Union CBA has problems. We need a blunt and honest discussion with parties AND board.

•

We seem to have a big problem in maintaining operators and maintenance employees. Yes, there is nationwide labor shortage, but we do hear grumblings that there is also a work culture
problem. I believe we have not adequately addressed this culture problem, through understanding what is problematic and what needs improvement, so we might be able to maintain
employees more effectively.

Additional Comments – Needs Improvement
•

Concerned about the disparity in the mid-year financial plan and the $40+ upcoming shortfall.

•

Failure.

•

Finances are in bad shape.

•

I am a bit concerned that the Board had to say whoa to staff initiated service cut-backs (due to labor issues) without local input. It seemed fast-tracked to me.
While I understand the urgency of the matter, staff needs to understand the pressure of local interests. I think we might have endured another public relations
black-eye with out taking the time to check in with our local stakeholders. I do appreciate Dave's town halls and outreach in this regard.

•

It's great that RTD can balance its annual budgets. I am concerned however that in the long term, it appears to be less possible to balance budgets. This
indicates to me that we have an imbalance between our revenues and expenses and this does not seem sustainable to me. We need to address this problem and
not keep kicking the can down the road.

•

See prior and subsequent comments

•

The 2020 budget was balanced after staff reported a shortfall in excess of $40 million. At the same time, significant service cuts were recommended. Additional
cuts were required to balance the budget. We should not go into a fiscal year anticipating such a large deficit for which we must correct.

•

The problem of the last few years that are beginning to surface include many of these subjects. We are struggling to balance our budget, our state of good
repair is in jeopardy, the Pension Trust is unsustainable, and we are unable to complete the remains of FasTracks. I'm sorry that we are in such a miserable
state, and certainly it is not entirely the fault of the GM's performance in 2019 - but sadly, he gets paid to prevent this slide into disrepair and disfunction, so he
gets to bear the brunt of the blame. We have been going downhill almost from the day Dave Genova "took the reins" and he has been unable to turn the agency
around. Perhaps the recruitment of a large group of stakeholders in the Reimagine Advisory Council and Technical Working Group will be able to effect some
improvement.

While generally we are bringing this item to the fore in our financial

are in has compromised the agency's ability in some areas to
maintain its assets. In addition to the operator shortages on light
rail, we hear about power outages or other switch/electrical issues
as a frequent cause of service lapses; is this due to aging
infrastructure, or an issue of maintenance? In addition, the excellent
work the vehicle maintenance crews do to extend the lifespan of our
rolling stock may be in jeopardy with reports of a reduction in the
crews who do the actual maintenance.

• Because I checked 'meets goal' in the prior item on Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods, it didn't offer the
chance to include an explanation, so here it is: I believe our service planners are a dedicated, capable group. Their job will
be facilitated once we've had a chance as an agency to explore our basis for prioritizing service delivery. Not just the
ridership versus coverage question, but taking into account the billions in commitment this region has made in building a
rapid transit backbone, together with regional growth projections and land use aims -- and working from there in a way
that aligns how we operate within all of that plus given the evolving transportation landscape. If we were in better shape
otherwise, we'd have to ability to do this thoughtfully as planned during the T2 study, and I would certainly have indicated
'exceeds goal' in rating it. But I fear we are in danger of foreclosing that laudable process.
• Comments above are sufficient.
• Dave needs to shift gears and concentrate on making what we have work well for transit riders in the District. With the
opening of the N line next year the major construction era will be over for a number of years.
• For me, I am very concerned about the state of RTD. I would say in a word that we are in crisis and we need immediate
strategies to bring back credibility to the District.
• I believe RTD's positive performance in the next 12 to 24 months is paramount. Dave has to pull the SLT and the Board
together to work collaboratively to make real progress on labor issues and complete the N-Line without a delay into 2021.
I believe the talent is there to accomplish these goals. While Reimagine RTD is a worthwhile endeavor, we must remember
that the fundamental functions of RTD are how we are measured. This will require laser focus, perhaps the shifting of
priorities, and increased internal communications to keep us all on the same successful path.
• I don't believe we can achieve the staffing needs by year end, and I am concerned about a proactive means to manage the
2020 budget and mid-year financial plans

Additional Comments (Cont’d)
• I think Dave is an excellent human being. This is not about his character. This is about his character as a leader. I don't
have confidence in his ability to lead this agency further.
• It unfortunately seems that a lot of problems are materializing at one time. I appreciate all the hard work expended by
the GM and staff and know they are addressing a slew of difficulties. I do think the time is now to look at long standing
personnel, budget and partnership problems.
• One Board member stated that the agency is “in crisis.” I agree. We have had a series of public failures that have harmed
the reputation of the agency and undone the prior good work of your new AGM of Communications. It sometimes appears
that the tail is wagging the dog - the senior staff operate outside the knowledge or direction of the GM. Some senior staff
appear to be intolerant or at least indifferent to Board members. There has been a failure to follow through or follow up
on items by the GM. When the GM meets with community leaders and Board members, he takes copious notes but merely
acknowledges their comments seemingly unable to offer ideas that may be explored to address identified issues. It does
not appear to be a situation of having a moderated and responsible response mechanism but often a failure to be able to
offer creative ideas. The GM appears to have reluctance to demand better from his senior staff.

• This has been a difficult year for transit agencies across the nation. I see RTD as taking the same steps to address the
challenges as other agencies. Mr. Genova is thought of as a leader in the transit industry, exemplified by his election to
APTA executive committee, the number of presentations he and staff are asked to give and moving the needle on FTA's
position on the University of Colorado A Line and the G Line. The number of local events he attends is unbelievable. The
operator headcount and financial situation RTD is in is not isolated. It's not a symptom of mismanagement or risky
financial maneuvers. It's a national economic condition that is affecting public agencies of all industries.
• Very tough environment. Regarding finances-- Need mindset that we are in recession NOW. Projections for revenue need
to be minimal expectations.
