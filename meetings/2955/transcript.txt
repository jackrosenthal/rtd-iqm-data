Nov 19 2019 0300 PM GM Oversight & Performance
Management Committee
BOB BROOM: November 19th-- meeting of the GM Oversight and Performance Management
Committee to order. I don't think you'll need to take attendance, do we?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We can go around the room. And then that way it'll be-BOB BROOM: OK, Claudia?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Claudia Folksa, Director District E.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Barbara McManus, Executive Manager Board of Directors.
TROY WHITMORE: Troy Whitmore, District K Director.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Angie Rivera-Malpiede, District C.
NATALIE MENTEN: Natalie Menten, District M.
VINCE BUZEK: Vince Buzek, District J.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lynn Guissinger, District O.
SHELLEY COOK: Shelley Cook, District L.
DOUG TISDALE: Doug Tisdale, District H and member of the Committee.
JEFF WALKER: Jeff Walker, District B.
BOB BROOM: And Bob Broom, Chair District F. I'm going to ask Barbara to go through this
process.
PEGGY CATLIN: This is Peggy Catlin, District N.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Anybody else?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Anybody else on the phone? OK.
BOB BROOM: OK. I'm going to ask Barbara to lead us through this process we're going to do
today, so that we can get started.

BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, so I'm going to pass out to non-Committee Directors a packet
that doesn't have the evaluation criteria in it. But it has everything else in it that we'll be looking
at.
SHELLEY COOK: Thanks.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Who didn't get one?
TROY WHITMORE: We have a different set.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. You get a different packet.
TROY WHITMORE: It just has instructions and descriptions.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So Chair Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Broom.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Sorry, Lynn.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It's all right.
VINCE BUZEK: Pardon my reach.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It's OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Angie Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Whitmore and Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Barbara, just a quick question for clarification.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Why are the packets different?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because the Committee does the evaluation. And there is an
evaluation criteria-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Oh, I see. I see, OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --section at the bottom. And part of that information is not public
information yet. So we'll go through the evaluation.
And then at the end of this meeting, we'll collect those packets back. And then when the Chair of
the Committee sit down with the Dave Genova and ask Dave Genova for his response, then we'll
go over his response with the consensus of this Committee on December 3rd. And at that point,
everything will become public.
LYNN GUISSINGER: But the meeting's public today unless we go into Executive Session,
right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's correct.
NATALIE MENTEN: Wasn't the evaluation also the responses to the survey, I should say.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, only the mid-year and year end overall.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
JUDY LUBOW: That's Claudia's book.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, here.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Here's one for you.
JUDY LUBOW: Can you give me a one second summary?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: I'm sorry I'm late.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I just passed out-- this is a copy of everything that each Committee
member has. The only difference is that the members of the Committee have evaluation criteria
on their side, because they're the voting members of this Committee as we're moving through.
These packets will be collected at the end. And then when the Chair of the Committee and the
Chair of the Board sit down with Dave and go over all of this with him, he'll prepare a response
that he'll bring back to this committee on December 3rd.

JUDY LUBOW: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And at that point in time on the 4th after that Committee, then all of
the information becomes public. But right now, it's not.
SHELLEY COOK: And do all of our reviews become public at that point?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
JUDY LUBOW: And what about this, our discussion now? Because it's not executive session.
But it's confidential, isn't it?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. That's my concern, too.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So what I'm thinking is we're going to go through this evaluation, and
you're sitting in on the evaluation. We're not going line through line through anything that was
on the survey. We're just going to be discussing what Dave has presented to us and evaluating
that against what we all approved that he was going to be valued against for the year 2019. And-JUDY LUBOW: Isn't this the definition of personnel? I mean, isn't this something that is covered
by executive privilege not to be-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It can be, but it has to be a 2/3 vote to take it into Executive
Session. But it seems like-JUDY LUBOW: It seems appropriate to me. I mean, this is a-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree.
JUDY LUBOW: This is personnel matters. I feel that way.
DOUG TISDALE: The Committee could vote to go into Executive Session. That would be up to
the members of the Committee, whether you want an Executive Session. And we have six
members present, so it would take four members voting yes-JUDY LUBOW: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: --to Executive Session.
BOB BROOM: And the other thing is, for the meeting on the 3rd, Dave can request it be -DOUG TISDALE: He can request it at that time. He can request that it be open. Even if we
decide to go into executive session, he could say, no, I want it open and for the public.
JUDY LUBOW: But for this meeting, we can ask. We can have a motion to make it--

DOUG TISDALE: A Committee member could make that motion, yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would like to make that motion that this stay an Executive
Session.
VINCE BUZEK: Second.
BOB BROOM: Discussion? I call it. Question, that all those in favor, say aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Aye.
VINCE BUZEK: Aye.
TROY WHITMORE: Aye.
BOB BROOM: Well, hold your hand up. OK. We got three. Those opposed?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I knew that would happened.
DOUG TISDALE: Motion fails.
VINCE BUZEK: Who's the seventh member we're missing?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Shontel.
DOUG TISDALE: Director Lewis.
SHELLEY COOK: Isn't she coming?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: She said she was.
DOUG TISDALE: She said she was coming, yeah. She said she going to.
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
BOB BROOM: I did get an RSVP from her.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: May I ask for a point of clarification? If Director Lewis does
come in, can we take the vote again? Or is it done at this point?
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's done at this point. And I have to step out and get the CRS
language in order to go into executive session. So I am going to pause everything and-DOUG TISDALE: Well, but it didn't. Motion failed.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh.

[AUDIO OUT]
BARBARA MCMANUS: I though I heard the word pass.
JUDY LUBOW: I did, too. I did-DOUG TISDALE: I thought I said did not pass or fail, one of the other.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Whatever.
DOUG TISDALE: But in any event-- yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Are you not concerned about keeping this private till we
discussed it?
DOUG TISDALE: Personally, I have some concerns. But I will share with you that I think we're
all professional, responsible, elected public officials. I'm assuming that our discussion will reflect
that and that there's no reason we can't have that discussion in public.
I think that it serves a very valid purpose. And I know that Director Broom is the one who
indicated this earlier. And you reflected that in the Executive Committee meeting that we had
just last week I guess it was, that it was understood this was going to be an open meeting and not
executive session.
So that's kind of, I think, how I look at it, too. I mean, I really do think there is a temptation on
the part of some to say, well, this will be a great chance for venting. We're all professionals.
LYNN GUISSINGER: My would be David.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah. Me, too.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So is he OK with this being public?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: You know, I would not want my review-DOUG TISDALE: I mean, because recall-KATE WILLIAMS: --to be aired to all of the members of my organization. I think that's between
me and the people to whom I report.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: Isn't this phase considered sort of work product, because it's not released yet?
And in keeping with that, it seems like you have a non-public session.

DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. No, I heard what you said.
JUDY LUBOW: There's a purpose for personnel matters to be private.
DOUG TISDALE: Personnel matters can be, yeah.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, but the reason is, one, to protect people and, also, to further greater
honesty. I mean, there really is a reason to have it private.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And let me ask this. Does Dave know where the reviews came out and
still want it to be public?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. Dave is aware that the evaluations have been done. And he's aware that
this Committee is now meeting, so that the Committee, the six members and, if she arrives,
Director Lewis is the seventh member, will then go through a process of saying, all right, the
Committee's assessment by majority, or plurality depending on how it works, is needs
improvement, achieve goal, exceeded expectations on 10 different goals. That's what we're here
to do today.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So our reviews don't count?
TROY WHITMORE: Yeah, we need to get started.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that-BARBARA MCMANUS: No. So on this page here, it shows what the ratings were, the synopsis
of what the ratings were from the survey. But the line by line what's in the survey will not be
discussed today.
KATE WILLIAMS: What page is that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's only for Committee members.
VINCE BUZEK: So I have a question on the member's-BARBARA MCMANUS: Only the Committee gets the evaluation.
KATE WILLIAMS: Oh.
VINCE BUZEK: --packets.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because they have to pass them back in.
VINCE BUZEK: --where it has the vote. We didn't do this the last eval. We only do at the end of
year evaluation?

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And it's only members who get to vote. Is that correct?
DOUG TISDALE: That is correct. Yeah, that's right. That said, understand Dave, when Chair
Broom and I-- there she is.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Hi.
JUDY LUBOW: We are having a vote.
VINCE BUZEK: When Chair Broom and I sit down with him, we'll have the benefit of all of the
information, the survey, his accomplishments memo, the complete evaluation report that was
distributed to all of you confidentially last week, and the evaluation that the Committee will do
now, so that he can then, based upon all of that, come back to this Committee with a response on
December 3rd.
BOB BROOM: OK, let's get moving. Because we're not going to get anything done if we spendSHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
BOB BROOM: --the entire first half of the meeting.
JUDY LUBOW: Well, we can have another vote with her.
BOB BROOM: No, we cannot. We've taken a vote. We're going to move forward.
LYNN GUISSINGER: They voted not to make this a private meeting.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Oh. Well-KATE WILLIAMS: By Dave's choice.
SHONTEL LEWIS: There you go.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: Fully informed.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Makes decisions.

DOUG TISDALE: All right. Barbara, please continue.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK. So the first page is just the overview memo that Dave sent before
discussing-DOUG TISDALE: And you got yours? Yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --all of the highlights of the yearly evaluation. The evaluation itself
starts on page three, which may be different on your packets. I don't know if it is or it isn't. I
think only all but one are the same.
So we're going to look at the core. These are the core goals. We're going to look at what was
approved by the Board of Directors that Dave would be evaluated against, and also looking at his
response, as well as what he feels his rating was as opposed to what the Board feels the rating
was.
KATE WILLIAMS: Can I ask a question?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
KATE WILLIAMS: So those of us who are not on the Committee-DOUG TISDALE: Right.
KATE WILLIAMS: --are welcome to sit here, but we don't get that information.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, you'll get the information as we move through it.
DOUG TISDALE: You have all the information.
KATE WILLIAMS: No, I do not.
JUDY LUBOW: No, we do not. The stuff with the blue on the top?
KATE WILLIAMS: I do not have that piece of paper.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, yeah. You were given that last week. You got that last week.
JUDY LUBOW: Right. We did not bring it with us.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. But, no, you got it last week.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK.

BOB BROOM: Barbara has a good reason why that is.
KATE WILLIAMS: Because you have to turn these back down. I got it.
BARBARA MCMANUS: This is [INAUDIBLE].
KATE WILLIAMS: So that my question stands. So those of us who are not on the GMOC
Committee can be here. We should probably mostly be quiet because it's not our vote. And we
don't get some of that information.
JUDY LUBOW: You've got to zip your lip, Kate.
[LAUGHTER]
KATE WILLIAMS: That'll be the day, but -- I'll give it my best shot.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well, we're invited to contribute, just not vote, correct?
BOB BROOM: That's correct.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thanks.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Yeah, I'm not going to have you just sit here mum. But-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, they're allowed. Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I'm thinking that when you did the survey you went through all
this evidence already. So you know, you tell me when it's a good comfortable time where we can
have a discussion and move forward.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't only think my vote's going to be different here than it was on my
evaluation.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Nor [INAUDIBLE].
VINCE BUZEK: This should take about 5 minutes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, it may not be.
KATE WILLIAMS: [INAUDIBLE] [? discuss. ?]

DOUG TISDALE: Because in terms of goal number one, just to summarize, court rule one, there
was a tie in terms of a majority. So an equal number of people said needs improvement as said
achieves goal. And it's an assessment for the Committee now.
Do you think it's achieved goal? Do you think it needs improvement? Do you think it's exceeds
expectation?
The reason for, as I understand it, how this is put together having Dave's memo here is that it is
possible-- emphasis on the word possible, not speculated that people actually did this. But it is
possible that some people might not have read the memo when they were filling out the form, but
rather were responding based upon their own perceptions. And so the material is set forth here. I
certainly would still say that it's at least achieved goal. So I'll go first.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Could you actually articulate the first one, what it is?
DOUG TISDALE: Say it again now.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Can you read the goal?
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, OK. Thank you, yes. Court rule number one, successful delivery of
transit services that's attaining 80% of the performance measures. And you will achieve the goal
if you achieve 80% of RTD approved performance measures. And Mr. Genova attached the
information documenting that he did, or that the agency, in fact, did achieve 80% of approved
performance measures, and then creates, collaborates, explains, and implements unincorporated
slash urban slash suburban local area service standard and presents a plan to not significantly
reduce service levels, and monitors DTP performance and compliance, and reports this
information to the board.
And looking at page four of the committee packet, for example, I see presents a plan to not
significantly reduce service levels. You go down to the last bullet, and he implemented changes
that resulted in a positive gain of service hours for base system and so on. And I don't want to
burden this all with my views Looking at the report, I see it as at least achieved goal.
SHONTEL LEWIS: May I ask a question?
DOUG TISDALE: Sure.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Did you all get an opportunity to see the document that I submitted, because
I missed the deadline?
VINCE BUZEK: No.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No.

SHONTEL LEWIS: Would you like me to print that out, as [? you all ?] [? are-- ?]
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] Yeah.
[? NATALIE MENTEN: ?] Sure.
JUDY LUBOW: Well-BOB BROOM: We're not going to-JUDY LUBOW: We're not bound.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We're not bound, but yeah.
BOB BROOM: --take the time during this meeting for people to read that.
SHONTEL LEWIS: That's why I sent it ahead of time, so that folks could get it ahead of time.
BARBARA MCMANUS: But we're not going through any of the survey here today. We know
what the survey results are. They're here.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Some of them.
JUDY LUBOW: Except hers, yes. The important one.
VINCE BUZEK: I'm still not clear on the process. And so it seems like 15 board members
submitted evaluations, but-BARBARA MCMANUS: 14.
VINCE BUZEK: 14. And then-SHELLEY COOK: No, 15.
SHONTEL LEWIS: [INAUDIBLE] 15.
BOB BROOM: That's how we ended up with a tie.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Seven make the decision.
VINCE BUZEK: So the seven members of this are the ones that make the final decision, and the
other eight don't count? I don't-DOUG TISDALE: No.
KATE WILLIAMS: Correct.

VINCE BUZEK: I'm missing that. Could you-KATE WILLIAMS: That is correct.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm missing it, too.
DOUG TISDALE: No, no. Jeff?
JEFF WALKER: If I may?
DOUG TISDALE: Sure.
JEFF WALKER: This Committee takes all of the comments into consideration when we're
discussing the performance of each goal. So they do count. They just don't count directly. But we
do take that in sum. We do take all of the comments in sum.
BOB BROOM: What I'm trying to gain from this is what guidance am I going to give Dave
when we go to meet with him-VINCE BUZEK: [? Got ?] [? it. ?]
BOB BROOM: --to address the concerns. And so obviously, there's not much point in anybody
who said achieve goals to talk at this point. I'd rather hear from people feel he didn't achieve it to
explain what wasn't achieved, so that I can pass that along. That's very simple.
VINCE BUZEK: It's just that getting back to the process, I mean, it just seems strange that the
packet we have upon which we're going to vote has nothing but Dave's comments, and they're all
stellar and glowing, and has none of the comments from the other packet where there are all the
comments about needs improvement. It's just all the positives, and then please vote. It just seems
a little unusual to me.
DOUG TISDALE: If I may, part of it is you know what you said.
VINCE BUZEK: Sure.
DOUG TISDALE: And you've already read what other people said.
VINCE BUZEK: Got it.
DOUG TISDALE: And apparently, even the 15th one-- although I did not get that.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I-DOUG TISDALE: Apparently, other people got that. I did not get that.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No.

JUDY LUBOW: But no, she's [INAUDIBLE].
SHONTEL LEWIS: They were saying they did not get it.
[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] I didn't get it.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: It hasn't been distributed. My agreement was to give it to Dave. And I'm going to
give it to Dave.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, OK. But the idea is that all of this information will be shared with
Dave.
VINCE BUZEK: Got it.
DOUG TISDALE: All of that-VINCE BUZEK: Right.
DOUG TISDALE: --none of that is going to be capped up. But now you try to-- and it used to
matter, because this Committee used to provide a recommendation on raise and bonus. Those are
frozen in the contract. This Committee is not going to recommend or propose a raise or a bonus.
KATE WILLIAMS: How about a demotion or a cut in salary? Is this Committee going to
propose that?
DOUG TISDALE: This Committee doesn't, pursuant to the contract, have any authority to do
that. The Board certainly could consider that. The Committee is not chartered to do that.
KATE WILLIAMS: And what is the Committee's purpose then?
DOUG TISDALE: To accept the information from all the Directors, to share with the General
Manager in as constructive way as possible to try to work together collaboratively to see if there
are shortcomings where they can be fixed.
KATE WILLIAMS: [INAUDIBLE]
JUDY LUBOW: Can I-- I'm bursting.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, if you're bursting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I get it.
VINCE BUZEK: That's Kate's job.

JUDY LUBOW: I wrote something up about just a list of some of the major glaring problems
that we have. That may not come out with the review that you're doing. To me, it seems like you
guys are going to make recommendations, and basically they're not going to include the people
that aren't voting in your Committee. And that's the majority of people on the Board. I'm really
missing how valuable your recommendation is going to be.
BOB BROOM: If you put it in the survey, then it's going to get to them.
JUDY LUBOW: But today, you're ignoring the survey.
BOB BROOM: Well, but you know-JUDY LUBOW: I'm sorry.
BOB BROOM: If you've got two different opinions on the Board or four different opinions on
the Board, somebody has to synthesize that and determine what is the most important part of this
that we need to communicate with Dave? You can't tell them to do two different things. I mean,
that doesn't work.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Would [? it ?] just give him the feedback?
JUDY LUBOW: The process that you are following is not going to get my concerns. And I think
they're very valuable.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I agree.
JUDY LUBOW: I think we have a lot of really valuable things to say to Dave that I don't think is
going to be said through that process.
VINCE BUZEK: Was this the same process as last year?
KATE WILLIAMS: No. Last year, the Committee voted on Dave's contract, which is where he
got his [INAUDIBLE].
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it was part of the process.
VINCE BUZEK: Oh, OK. OK.
DOUG TISDALE: It is fair to say it is the same process as last year, except for the fact that
process also included voting on the contract.
VINCE BUZEK: So the format was the same with the voting on the box and this kind of a
packet.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it's more refined as we move along. But, yes, it's the same.

VINCE BUZEK: OK.
BOB BROOM: Is that [INAUDIBLE].
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I seem to recall-BOB BROOM: I mean, you were the Chair last year.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, it's the same. It's the same. The contract came up, because it was the end
of a term. So we had to make a decision about what we wanted to do about that, continue or-VINCE BUZEK: Makes sense, that makes sense.
JEFF WALKER: OK. But every-- if I may continue-DOUG TISDALE: OK.
JEFF WALKER: Every opinion counts. And there have been changes to this process that have
been suggested and implemented that were put forth by people who were not on the Committee.
I can't go down the list of them now.
But I know that that every comment counts. And I've read all the comments that were submitted
by the Board members. I've read Dave's. So they're all in there in [INAUDIBLE].
JUDY LUBOW: Why aren't they here with us now while you look at this? I don't get it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And especially for the Committee.
JUDY LUBOW: I don't get it.
DOUG TISDALE: Claudia's had her hand up for a long time.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: So I think what I'm hearing-- and since I can't see this, but this is 100%
what I hear from Director Buzek of a glowing report of Dave's self-evaluation. And what is
absent are the concerns and issues that have been brought up by all of the members of our Board
of Directors. And we don't have those documents to compare. And it feels very self-serving I
think. That's my takeaway on that.
I did want to address the 80% issue there. And it was some time ago. And I think when I first got
on the Board, and Phil Washington was Chair-- I mean, Executive Director. Our performance
measures for something like 95%.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Director Lubow can-- yeah.

NATALIE MENTEN: And Angie.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: --and Rivera-Malpiede, and Bruce Abel kept chipping away at it, bringing
it from 95 to 94 to 93. And now, stunningly, we're down to 80. So you can just drop it down to
70 if you want. You know, why not?
BOB BROOM: But this is what was agreed to up front.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I'm just saying that has how our service has devolved over my tenure.
That's all. Thank you.
BOB BROOM: OK. Chair.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you. Relative to everyone else's comments, those absolutely are on the
record for Dave. They will be shared with Dave. Chair Broom and I will share every piece of it.
Nothing that anyone has said will be ignored, cast aside.
What we as the Chair of the Committee and the Chair of the Board are to do is to say, here is all
the negative comments. Here are some that we think based upon the Committee's view deserve
even more special attention. Every comment will be shared. Every comment is important.
But we have to provide some additional emphasis on some where we have that. And if you say,
this listing of goals doesn't cover what I'm concerned about, then the question is it's the same
response as was made to Director Williams last year. Then when we create these criteria, which
we've already approved for 2020, it is appropriate to speak up then.
You cannot change the rules in the middle of the game. You can't tell a General Manager this is
what you have to do, and then once he does it say, no, no, no. I was thinking of something else,
and you're not doing what I was thinking of.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Do you have reason to think that we're going that?
DOUG TISDALE: That's the point. I'm sorry, I wasn't quite done. That's the point that we have
to share.
JUDY LUBOW: But do you get the point that there was a majority or almost a majority of
people with negative comments? I don't get that feeling from you guys that this is incredibly
important to deal with this?
DOUG TISDALE: Have I not said that clearly enough? Let me try one more time.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well, let me just say that-DOUG TISDALE: No, if I may, let me just please-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Don't mix it up. Just address the issue.

DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Don't mix it up. Nobody's changing the goalpost.
DOUG TISDALE: No, OK.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: What Judy wants to know is why the concerned issues aren't present
alongside this narrative. That's it.
DOUG TISDALE: And I will just conclude if I may. They are number one, to say again-because, apparently, it was not heard. And I apologize that falls on me. I'm a poor communicator.
Every single negative comment will be communicated to Dave without exception, without fail.
There is not a one that will not be communicated to Dave no matter when they were submitted.
Every single comment good, bad, or indifferent will be shared with Dave.
Number two, if there is a concern you have that is not addressed in the core goals or the task
goals, then it may be of interest to you, but it wasn't expressed in the goals. Thank you.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] I have a simple little one.
BOB BROOM: You know, my goal as Chair is to call balls and strikes. I'm not here to be on one
side or the other. I just hope you understand that. So I'm listening to all this, but I'm not going to
weigh in particularly and tell you you have to do it this way or you have to do it that way. That's
not my style.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do have point just asking a plain clarification.
JUDY LUBOW: I asked first.
BOB BROOM: No, she's been-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Have not you and the Chair already met with Mr. Genova?
BOB BROOM: We met with him for a few minutes, yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. So you have met with him already about the comments.
DOUG TISDALE: To let him know that there were negative comments, yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Absolutely.

VINCE BUZEK: I have a similar. What I don't see-- and Doug knows this from last year, I do
my own self-evaluation. And my Board is doing my evaluation at the same time every year. It's
very awkward.
What I do not see are any negative comments from Dave about himself. And when I do mine, I
know what I have not done. And I step up to the plate, and I tell my Board what I have not done.
I do not see anything here where Dave Genova acknowledges what he has not done.
BOB BROOM: That's a legitimate point.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. So as a member of the Committee, I would like to address
the first core goal and say that I vote for needs improvement based really on the last quarter.
When I looked at the July evaluation and then looked at this evaluation and did a measurement, I
based it on on-time performance and the issues that are across the board, the media, the
community.
And we have lost so much service. We are in a crisis with the number of dropped bus routes and
rail drops that I don't think we're even at 70%. So that was the reason I put needs improvement.
So I think it's a fail, for me.
VINCE BUZEK: And process wise, is this how we do it? Do we mark our sheets and turn them
in? How-[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] Well, our names are on there.
BOB BROOM: We're discussing. And then you mark it, and then we turn them in.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. I agree with Director Malpiede.
JUDY LUBOW: Me, too.
BOB BROOM: Are there any other comments?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I am also in agreement-DOUG TISDALE: I just-- oh, I'm sorry.
SHONTEL LEWIS: --with Director Malpiede. No, you're fine. And I just want to honor the
voices of the rest of the folks who are in this room who don't think that their voices are being
heard. And so I can read some of these comments if that is of interest to any of you. If you feel
like that would help elevate your voices and your responses, I'm happy to do that-- someone has
a hand.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Go ahead.

LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that the third one here, present a plan to maintain existing service
levels, we clearly are not at that point. So I think that that makes it needs improvement as it is.
DOUG TISDALE: I'd just like to ask a question. Director Second Vice Chair Malpiede said
we're at 70%.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Where does it say that? Do you have any place where it actually says that, the
we're at 70%?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: [INAUDIBLE] very first thing, achieve at least 70% of RTD
Board-approved performance metric.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So on page three-DOUG TISDALE: No, I know. No, no. She said we're not at-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I believe we're not even at 70%.
DOUG TISDALE: What evidence? Any evidence? Anything?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm going to base it on all the emails I get every morning on
Rider Alert for H, L, D, C, every single one of them. Every time I'm on the street, there's no bus.
Every time I go to an RTD Board meeting, I'm being told that there's more and more service cuts
being done.
And what it's saying to me is we are in serious trouble. We're about 70% of service. I think that
we're seeing the implications of that happening across the region, not just in my district. This is
not an emotional thing. This is a factual thing that I'm dealing with my constituents emailing me,
calling me, and getting the service cut levels on my phone every day.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I might also add that we've seen declines.
BOB BROOM: The most recent monthly report doesn't reflect that.
KATE WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Bob. Say again.
BOB BROOM: The monthly report does not reflect that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: How much are you seeing our service [INAUDIBLE]?
JUDY LUBOW: 99.8% they say.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I believe that is totally incorrect.
SHONTEL LEWIS: If that were to be the case, one might question why we would need to look
at-[? [INTERPOSING VOICES] ?]
SHONTEL LEWIS: --in services if we're not dropping runs. But the reality is that we are seeing
runs being dropped.
BOB BROOM: Yeah, but if you're one of the 1%, I mean, you know, that's something that you
obviously notice.
JUDY LUBOW: We don't have confidence in those figures.
KATE WILLIAMS: Plus, you need just one of these to site needs improvement. And we have
already established that-VINCE BUZEK: Right.
KATE WILLIAMS: --the [INAUDIBLE] services [INAUDIBLE].
VINCE BUZEK: Presents a plan to maintain existing service levels, we're talking about cutting
them dramatically. So there is no plan to maintain existing service levels. So those are all Poors
that follow those sentences.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yeah, any one of those means it's needs improvement.
JEFF WALKER: If I may? That plan won't take effect until next year. And our evaluation is for
this year.
VINCE BUZEK: So the second point, there are clearly some people that think this needs
improvement and clearly those that don't. Are we going to spend an hour debating and
defending? Or are we just going to say what we think and what our vote is?
KATE WILLIAMS: And just do a percentage. So you can do, based on the number of people
who responded, you could do GM has 57% needs improvement, and 43% meets goals, and 0%
exceeds goals. You could just say that for each one of these categories. And I think that
everybody would feel a little better. Yes guys?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Absolutely.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, and I think, by the way, that's what Barbara described we're doing.
Because it's going to say how many say needs improvement, how many say achieves, how many
say exceeds.

JUDY LUBOW: [INAUDIBLE]
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I think they're talking about all of them, not just the Committee. But you
take all of the 15 responses and say 57% say goal number one needs improvement, achieve goal,
exceeded goal, whatever it is.
BOB BROOM: But this Committee should have a better feel for the. Because we've been
involved with the setting up the criteria and that type of thing.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: But you ask these people.
BOB BROOM: And we were involved six months ago when we did the previous interim review.
And now, we're looking at it again. And so all we're asking is for the Committee, the Committee,
to vote again on this. And then we'll get this done and move forward.
JUDY LUBOW: But we might have-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: But with all due respect, Chair, I would like to ask you to consider this.
Everyone at this table took the time to come to these meetings to serve their constituents and to
thoughtfully go over all of these elements, to go to the retreats, to work on it all year long. It's not
just a 10 minute, oh, yeah, flip it here and there.
And I think that they are owed at least, I would like to see, what the entire body evaluated every
little thing on. Sure, you guys go and vote the way you want to. But I want to see what the body
as a whole is thinking. And I think that everybody here has a right and deserves that.
BOB BROOM: Well, to the extent that you filled out the form, you already done it.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I know mine. But I don't know the group, the aggregate, right?
DOUG TISDALE: Sure you do.
BOB BROOM: It's been reported.
JUDY LUBOW: Excuse me, do you really want your process and an alternate process, where
people who are not comfortable with it will also go to Dave and say, here's what we think? That's
not-DOUG TISDALE: Mr. Chair, if I may? We sitting here did not start this fire.
KATE WILLIAMS: (SINGING) We didn't start the fire.
DOUG TISDALE: We did not create the GMOC. It was created a number of years ago. We're
just operating under the charter. The Board has the power at some point if it wants to change the
charter.

KATE WILLIAMS: How about tonight?
DOUG TISDALE: But you don't-- yeah, that's the thing. But you don't just do it in the middle of
a meeting and say, oh, I don't like that. I'm not going to follow the rules.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I'm just saying I want to have a view into the aggregate voting of all of the
things. I don't need it, names or anything. It's anonymatized.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, no.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: But-BARBARA MCMANUS: [INAUDIBLE]
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Why can't we have-- where is that? Is that here?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK. Well, I'm not seeing it. So I apologize.
DOUG TISDALE: Was I not clear that Dave is getting everything from-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I want it. I want it.
DOUG TISDALE: --everybody?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I want it.
DOUG TISDALE: You already did. You got it last week. You got it last week.
BOB BROOM: No, thanks.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: That has all the percentages?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. You got it last week.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I missed it. I apologized.
TROY WHITMORE: Clarifying, we all got that, not just the committee.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK, OK. All right.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. You got it last week.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Then I missed it. I apologized.

JUDY LUBOW: I guess what-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I don't know what it is.
JUDY LUBOW: --I have to say is that this has to be relevant. And I really thought we were
going to come here and talk about what are we going to do with Dave. And instead, we're going
to have this little Committee will vote. And they're going to vote this. And they're going to-- no.
This is a major discussion. We're not having it.
KATE WILLIAMS: Natalie, hasn't had a chance?
NATALIE MENTEN: May I bring something up?
BOB BROOM: Natalie?
NATALIE MENTEN: First of all, I got the packet. I read through the whole thing, so get that out
of the way.
[? JUDY LUBOW: ?] Congratulations.
NATALIE MENTEN: When this Committee comes out with the recommendation, they still
come to the Board. And there's a presentation or comments in open session. Are we going to
have that at all?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So this year, it's different. Because we're not voting to move anything
forward for Dave. There's no dollar amount attached to what this review is talking about.
So there's nothing for the Board to approve. So we're going through this process today, the
evaluation. Then on December 3rd, the Chair of the Committee and the Chair of the Board will
sit down with Dave and go line by line with these evaluations, the survey against what he has
provided to us.
And then on December 3rd, he comes back to this Committee. And he defends what he's already
given against what we approved he would be evalued against.
DOUG TISDALE: Well said.
SHONTEL LEWIS: And then?
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] And then? And then it goes on.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: Well, maybe so, maybe no.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, he does.
BARBARA MCMANUS: At that point in time.
BOB BROOM: So then go back, and we talked to Dave again, you know, in terms of what I'd
like to have is something like three or four major things that he needs to work on and ask him to
respond to what he's going to do to work on these three or four major board concerns.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So Mr. Chair, if I may, I disagree with you. I think if we find a
majority of this Board has no confidence, then I think we need to have a different discussion
besides something to work on, but to maybe look at a different-BOB BROOM: But that's not this Committee's charge.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's not this Committee.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Can I say something?
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes, please.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So what I'm hearing is that there are concerns outside of this process
and outside of this evaluation that this Board has concerns about.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And at that point in time, we can at anytime have an executive session
during any open meeting when all 12 Directors are here. They are not right now.
BOB BROOM: 15.
BARBARA MCMANUS: 15, I'm sorry.
[LAUGHTER]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: That's Barbara's way of trimming or budget.
[LAUGHTER]
DOUG TISDALE: We just saved money.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Sorry, not in this group. And then anything outside of this process that
needs to be discussed that this Board is unhappy with, that's how we do it. But that's not what's
happening here. So I would like to offer that as a path forward.

BOB BROOM: This is a preview of kind of where we're headed if we continue to discuss the
process. I'm going to ask everybody on the Committee to fill out their votes and hand it in.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, [INAUDIBLE] do that.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: Good idea.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think that's a great.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Great idea.
VINCE BUZEK: I think that makes sense.
JEFF WALKER: So the whole purpose of this discussion is so that Mr. Broom and Mr. Tisdale
can talk to Dave and share with him the amalgamation of all of your concerns.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: They've already talked to [INAUDIBLE].
KATE WILLIAMS: The concern I'd have is that-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: Wait, wait.
KATE WILLIAMS: --they are arguing.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: Excuse me, I'm sorry.
BARBARA MCMANUS: One at a time, please.
JEFF WALKER: I have the floor. I have the floor.
BARBARA MCMANUS: One at a time, please.
JEFF WALKER: So they've spoken with him already, but that's at a high level. Now, Dave is not
here. So we have his comments. You all are here or at least have the opportunity to be here or
call in or something. So we have your comments. We don't need those written.
So what we need to do, instead of talking about the process, is just get down to the meat of it and
say, here's what we think. Go around the table say, here's what you think, not about the process,
but about the performance. And then so these two guys can meet with him again and say, here's

what we've heard in more detail. And here is what we're hearing that you need to do in more
detail.
BARBARA MCMANUS: In terms of this criteria.
JEFF WALKER: In terms of these criteria.
DOUG TISDALE: Right. And if I may just supplement to that, the point is he has to know when
he comes to meet with everybody on December 3rd what is he responding to. And it seems
unfair to tell someone here's what we're measuring, tell us how you did.
He gave us all that. People have responded and said, I disagree with that. I think we're providing
20% of service according to Second Vice Chair.
[? KATE WILLIAMS: ?] That's not what she said.
DOUG TISDALE: He has a right to respond to that. That's what this is all about. So as Chair
Broom points out, if we say here are the areas of greatest concern, isn't it just fair to tell him
that? Wouldn't you want to know that if you were in that situation?
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] Didn't he get all of our comments?
DOUG TISDALE: I'm sorry, let me just finish my thought if I may. It'll be short. Or would you
rather somebody blindsided you, and you think that's fair to you?
KATE WILLIAMS: I don't think that's what any of us suggest doing. And my concern is that, if
it's left to you all, who plainly disagree with what some of us have used as criteria and/or are
rendering as judgment, then I don't want to be offensive, but I don't have the trust that you would
actually bring the concerns forward in the way that the Board as a whole would mean to have
them brought forward.
BOB BROOM: Well, you know, let's stop for just a second now. We have an opportunity at any
time to ask for a meeting and go sit down with him and tell him what our problems are. You
always got that alternative.
And he would be more than happy to sit down with you. I mean, I know I would be if I were in
his shoes. I'd want to hear from an individual if they were really unhappy.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK. So maybe the option is each and every one of us needs to sit down with
Dave, bring our copy. Can I have a copy of my review that I spend a lot of time on? And I can
take it and hand it to Dave and say, here's what I think, General Manager Genova. So we can
move to that. I think that's a bad use of time. But if that's the only way to make sure that Dave
understands what people here who've spent-- I've spent a lot of time and thought-[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] I have, too.

KATE WILLIAMS: --on that process.
BOB BROOM: Well, in my notes, I was going to first thank everybody for spending all the time
that they did to go through this in giving comments. Because in the past, most people just filled
the thing out, no comments, and just went forward-- so very little feedback to Dave from this
Board in the past as a result of that that was really concrete. You know, it's kind of hard to
respond to something if you don't know exactly what the problem is.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So wouldn't having an executive session instead of, as you said-BOB BROOM: Go ahead and finish.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --taking individual meetings with the General Manager and just have
an executive session?
LYNN GUISSINGER: A Board executive session.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that's what we [INAUDIBLE].
KATE WILLIAMS: I do, too.
JUDY LUBOW: You mean Board without Dave?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, with Dave.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: But an executive session.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well, you know, we voted on that already. And everybody voted it down.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, that was for this meeting. We're saying in another meeting with
the full Board, all 15 members there. Go into an executive session and have the conversations
that everybody was expecting to have today, some of which may or may not fit the criteria that
we're evaluating him against. Yes, he needs to hear everything. And he needs to hear how you
feel.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Excuse me, Miss. McManus. Are you also evaluating Dave?
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, I'm not.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK. I'm confused.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'm just following the process.

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Because you're saying we're evaluating him and we're doing that, and I
appreciate that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We, as the Board.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: But you're not the Board.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: We are the Board.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK. We, as the Board Office. I apologize.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I just think it's important to make that distinction. And you know, this is
Chair Broom's Committee. And I think he should run it.
BOB BROOM: Yeah, you know, 15 people to deal with at the same time in executive session is
pretty problematic.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's typical for an Executive Director or General Manager to answer
directly to their Board. I have to do it. I don't like it. But my board is not-BOB BROOM: Do you have 15?
KATE WILLIAMS: I have 12. And they're from all over the-DOUG TISDALE: That's where Barbara got that number.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's [INAUDIBLE].
KATE WILLIAMS: And if I sat down at a meeting with my 12 members and half of them had
the reaction that we are having, I would be looking for a job myself. And I have been in a similar
seat today in many ways, so just FYI.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would just like to say half of this Board is new. We've been
here for almost a year. And so when we did the July event, thing, a lot of us said we don't have
enough information, we're new.
[? CLAUDIA FOLSKA: ?] It's true.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This is now six months. So now, we've had a half a year to do an
evaluation. And I think the July one was people really didn't feel that they could do anything
from measurement, because we didn't have that experience.
This one's pretty telling in terms of our experience as a Board member for the last six months-or the last year cumulative, was why I think in my opinion I was able to garner so much more

response in direct answering. Because I've been able to experience it, look at it, and evaluate it
based as a Director for District C. So I just want to say that for the record in terms of the
comments.
BOB BROOM: OK. I guess from the Chair's viewpoint, I think we should finish the process.
And you know, if Board members feel like they want to have an executive session of the full
Board, not this Committee, then they should take that up. And if they feel like they want to go
talk to Dave, they should go talk to Dave. But wait until this process is completed before you
request those one-on-ones with him to go over the evaluation process. Because I think that's
asking too much to have-KATE WILLIAMS: I thought we were going to do an executive session.
SHELLEY COOK: I think an executive session makes sense.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I think that's the better way, what Barbara said.
KATE WILLIAMS: All of us together.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] So what do you mean wait until it's completed? At what
point do you consider that point?
[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] December 14th.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
JUDY LUBOW: December 17th?
BARBARA MCMANUS: 17th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So you want us to go through this process and then have the
executive session?
BOB BROOM: Right. If the process is not satisfactory at that point in time, then that's your
prerogative.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would argue that we do that now and stop the process, so that
when we complete it we have done our due diligence to make sure that when we sit down for
that final product we're all in alignment with this. I think it's going to skew it completely if we do
this, act like there's nothing. Because it seems to me that, I agree, these are just line remarks.
There are no remarks here from the Board. And as a Committee member, if it's just us, if it's just
us seven, I can only speak for me. But I know by reading the comments that there is a majority of
this Board who has some serious concerns that is not going to be weighted in this.

BOB BROOM: Well, and that's something that we'll be telling Dave when we meet with him.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: When do you meet with Dave?
SHELLEY COOK: December 3rd.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Maybe a special meeting between the 3rd and the 17th?
DOUG TISDALE: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.
SHELLEY COOK: She said maybe a special meeting between the 3rd and the 17th?
DOUG TISDALE: Oh. I thought your question was when are we meeting with him.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. And you said December 3rd.
[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] That's another question.
DOUG TISDALE: I thought I heard that. The Chair and I are meeting with him next week.
SHELLEY COOK: That's what I wanted to know.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. I thought it might have been. So I wanted to make sure I answered that,
because the Chair and I are meeting with him next week.
JUDY LUBOW: About this?
KATE WILLIAMS: OK, you said-JUDY LUBOW: About these?
KATE WILLIAMS: --Dave and Bob will talk that Dave, Doug and Bob, on December 3rd. I
wrote that down.
DOUG TISDALE: I was going to say. I thought I said it several times actually. And I apologize.
I'm not communicating well tonight. So it's my fault.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's not next week.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That-DOUG TISDALE: No. I said the Chair-- I'll try again. The Committee's meeting today. Next
week, the Chair and I meet with him to share what the Committee discussed today.

KATE WILLIAMS: What's the date of that? Sorry.
BOB BROOM: Hasn't been set.
DOUG TISDALE: It hasn't been set. It will be next week.
KATE WILLIAMS: Oh, OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Then December 3rd, which has been set, is the date when the Committee will
meet with Dave for Dave to respond to the Committee relative to the survey, all the comments,
and the Committee's assessment. So again-- and Director Williams wrote it down correctly.
December 3rd the Committee meets. Dave will be with us. There have been several questions
today by a number of you.
Will that be executive session? It may or may not. Dave has the right to demand that it be an
open session. But, again, at least I know the tape remembers me. We're meeting on December the
3rd. We're meeting on December the 3rd. December the 3rd is when we meet.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's a Tuesday?
DOUG TISDALE: And it's a Tuesday.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And we're going to meet at our regular 5:30 time.
DOUG TISDALE: And we'll meet here at the regular time with Dave on December the 3rd.
KATE WILLIAMS: And then that's the one where Dave has the right to ask if it's public or not
public.
DOUG TISDALE: Correct.
KATE WILLIAMS: And by public, does that mean it will be recorded, broadcast or public?
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, just like this.
BOB BROOM: Just like this.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: This is being recorded.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: December 17th, that goes into a Board meeting. And kind of similar
thing happens.

BOB BROOM: But you'll just get a report for me about what the Committee has done at that
point in time.
KATE WILLIAMS: So there's not a meeting where we're all discussing the consequences of
what we're doing or anything?
BOB BROOM: It's not an agenda item. It's just a report from the Chair is all it is.
KATE WILLIAMS: And by the way, Dave can look at what's going on right here, right now.
And he probably, if he has any sense, he is since this is his public record.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it's not live. But-KATE WILLIAMS: But, I mean-- yeah. [INAUDIBLE] Dave. Dave's not here. No, he can look
at it. So anybody who feels like Dave isn't getting what you have to say, as soon as this meeting
is over, he can get it. And nobody's ever accused him of being stupid. So he's probably going to
know.
BOB BROOM: Can somebody just, you know, speak to core goal number one?
KATE WILLIAMS: Yeah, sorry [INAUDIBLE].
NATALIE MENTEN: Can I mention one thing?
BOB BROOM: Sure. [INAUDIBLE]
BARBARA MCMANUS: [INAUDIBLE] Natalie.
NATALIE MENTEN: It won't be complicated. I don't think the recorded vote of the executive
session, I don't think things are recorded for that to be put into the minutes.
DOUG TISDALE: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear.
JUDY LUBOW: And I can't understand it.
NATALIE MENTEN: There was a 3 to 3 vote. There were no names taken for that 3 to 3 vote. I
would think that everybody would want that part of our record.
LYNN GUISSINGER: That's a good point.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: And so before you go too much farther, one might want to add that in.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I agree.

SHELLEY COOK: That's a good idea.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think, too.
KATE WILLIAMS: And I have a question. Did somebody say there were seven members on this
Committee?
NATALIE MENTEN: That's correct.
KATE WILLIAMS: What happens with a-- 3 to 3 vote doesn't equal 7 members?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Because Director Lewis wasn't here at the moment.
NATALIE MENTEN: That's why it should all be recorded on your-KATE WILLIAMS: Who else is [INAUDIBLE]?
NATALIE MENTEN: There were three people over here.
SHONTEL LEWIS: 3:00 is a work day.
NATALIE MENTEN: And there two people down there.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I've said this several times to several people.
NATALIE MENTEN: But it didn't go in the [INAUDIBLE], and it should.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL LEWIS: Unless someone's going to give me a check-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL LEWIS: --I will be here at [INAUDIBLE].
KATE WILLIAMS: I got it. I just wanted to know why 3 and 3 equaled 7 members.
TROY WHITMORE: Well, can we record the votes now and then move ahead with the next
procedure?
BOB BROOM: Sure. Would the three people that requested it please raise your hands?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So Whitmore, Buzek, and Rivera-Malpiede.
BOB BROOM: OK.

SHONTEL LEWIS: So if we're just doing this process, could I chime in?
BOB BROOM: No.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It doesn't matter. It's all over.
KATE WILLIAMS: Are you on the Committee?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: Well, yeah. Absolutely, you can.
BOB BROOM: No, you can't.
VINCE BUZEK: That's just an historical-BOB BROOM: We've already-BARBARA MCMANUS: It's a historical vote. It's not a vote now.
VINCE BUZEK: It's historical is all this is.
DOUG TISDALE: It was voted over an hour ago.
TROY WHITMORE: [INAUDIBLE] do not know what's going on.
KATE WILLIAMS: But she's here now.
DOUG TISDALE: It was voted over an hour ago. And it was.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: We've already been in an open meeting for an hour.
DOUG TISDALE: In order to have a reconsideration, someone in the prevailing side must move
for a reconsideration. The prevailing side was not the people who proposed it.
KATE WILLIAMS: Got it.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
KATE WILLIAMS: No, it's the tie. So there's no prevailing side unless your vote counts for
more.
BOB BROOM: Back to core goal one, does anybody have any further comments on core goal
one?

VINCE BUZEK: No.
BOB BROOM: No. Then would you please vote on core goal one?
TROY WHITMORE: Done.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] Done.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, core goal two is on page 10.
DOUG TISDALE: Do you want me to read that for the benefit of the Committee?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No, it's OK. Because I mean, I don't need it. Everybody else can read it. I
mean, I'm not going to see what everybody is voting, so it's irrelevant to me at this point.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: But Thank. You so much for asking. No, I meant that. I did. I sincerely
meant that.
DOUG TISDALE: Apparently, it was viewed as sarcastic by a number of other members, which
is really kind of sad.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No, I thought it was very kind.
DOUG TISDALE: It really is kind of sad.
JUDY LUBOW: No, isn't it. It's all funny.
DOUG TISDALE: Gosh, because I took it nicely.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Good. All right, that's all that counts.
DOUG TISDALE: But I guess it just proves how naive I am.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: It's fine. I get it. You get it. That's what matters.
BOB BROOM: The majority rating from the Board at end of year was need improvement.
Would anybody like to speak to that?
TROY WHITMORE: No.
DOUG TISDALE: I actually do have a question about this one, and that is strong and ethical
leadership. I was trying to understand what the comments were on needs improvement. Because,
I mean, he certainly communicates with SLT, talks with-- I won't go on. I'm just asking can

somebody help me-- at least Director River-Malpiede said, look, we're not delivering 80% of
service. But if they say that, they're lying to us.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] [? I ?] [? might ?] [? call ?] that.
DOUG TISDALE: SLT is lying to us. We aren't delivering 80% of service. So it's needs
improvement. On this one, I'd like to hear some kind of thought on that.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'd like to call out, so-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: It may be just inappropriately titled-- strong and ethical leadership,
articulates vision, forms cohesive team, regular team building session, builds and maintains
effective executive team, and handles conflict. And so for me personally, if you all have received
this, I said that General Manager David Genova has yet to share a compelling vision on how he
and SLT will lead the agency toward strong financial health, increased ridership, or improving
the conditions for operators and mechanics.
SLT appears to lack the cohesion, racial diversity, and ability to consider an alternative approach
to transit. General Manager Dave Genova appears to lack the leadership needed at this point in
time to lead the agency and tends to have a very hands-off approach. Furthermore, General
Manager Dave Genova tends to avoid difficult conversations and difficult decisions, creating a
stagnated and confusing environment at a time when bold leadership and progress are in dire
need.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right. I'd like add to that.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: One of my big issues of concern is the lack of knowledge of the
political environment in which we as District Directors reside and that Mr. Genova understands-case in point, being with Mr. Genova as happenstance discussing just something on the way to B
line mentioned that he was meeting with newly elected councilwoman Candi CdeBaca.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I said, may I join you? She's in my district. And he said, I
didn't know she was in your district.
So he invited me. And I went to Director CdeBaca's office on the day that he invited me. And he
forgot the meeting, but called in. When I called, he thought it was at 11:00 instead of 10:30.
But I understand he also met with Councilwoman Sandoval, who is also in my district. And then
when there was an issue about the N line, he thought it was in Shelley's district. And I had to tell

him that it was in my district. So I had some real concerns about his geographic knowledge of
the political environment in which we are all elected members.
TROY WHITMORE: And I have an anecdotal story mentioned by at least three of us. I certainly
have no problem with the ethical side of things. I mean, he's a fine person. And it pains me to be
negative.
But when I look at cohesive team and I look at the effective executive team, we had a classic
blunder with the N line announcement that put four of us in a horrible embarrassing situation,
where presentation was changed from first quarter to 2020. Nobody told us. Now, that
information filtered all the way down the Lisa Trujillo who's doing the presentation. This is not
stuck with Michael Ford and Dave Genova.
And I'm up they're talking about first quarter. And as far as we know-- gung ho. And then the
hedging starts. And it started with Natalie before the meeting. And I guess I just kind of let it go.
She was cautious. It wasn't public. But then [? Alan ?] and Michael hedged. [INAUDIBLE] and
then [? Alan ?] goes into a diatribe about how he's betting his career on it getting done that year.
To me, there's a complete breakdown of communication between Michael Ford and Dave
Genova there and the lieutenants. And it was frankly embarrassing. And we have a seated
council member there who witnessed it and called us on it in front of everybody, 60, 70 people in
a room, right?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: And recorded in the paper.
TROY WHITMORE: record in the paper. So there is a breakdown there that needs to be
addressed.
BOB BROOM: Yeah. Now, this is the type of input that we need.
DOUG TISDALE: Right, right. Yup.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would just add one more on last Friday, because I think these
are all cumulative if you want direct response. When our senior AGMs do not know how much
we pay our drivers-[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] I agree.
JUDY LUBOW: --and state that in front of our elected body and the media, that is
unconscionable. For the Chairman to have to-[? TROY WHITMORE: ?] The Chairman?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --say what it is--

[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] And didn't think we had a budget problem.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --and did not think we had a budget problem, we are really
sending mixed messages. And that's from the senior leadership. It is a great concern.
TROY WHITMORE: And to add to that, I thought, otherwise, the team did a pretty darn good
job. And I told Dave that today. So if you find a conflictual message there, Bob and Doug,
maybe part of that's my fault but I thought Fred handled the heat fairly well. And Dave did OK,
you know, Michael, sort of OK. Pauletta was fine. And Bill didn't really have too much to deal
with.
But I thought they were in fairly cool under control or a little bit of fire it was a pretty mellow
button
it was
TROY WHITMORE: You know, the Board Chair had to tell him what the starting salary was.
BOB BROOM: [INAUDIBLE]. Go ahead.
KATE WILLIAMS: Can I give a quickie, little quickie that most of you are probably not
exposed to? I happen to be an EcoPass holder at my office. It's a large part of income that we
bring in and the face that we present to the public.
And the email that told you how to re-up for your EcoPass, when you click on it, it said this
email is no longer available. And I happen to be somebody who has some pull at RTD. So I
could call. But of the thousands of people who purchase our EcoPasses, they could not renew.
Because the email they were given to do their renewal was wrong.
BOB BROOM: Claudia?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you. I would like to say I got an email today from a constituent
who tried to submit a complaint on our website, and it's not working. And you know, there have
been consecutive complaints to me about that and that the Submit button doesn't work. But that's
not-- I mean, I think these are glitches that can be corrected. And I'm not too concerned about
that.
What I do want to remind everybody was-- and I wished I could forget it-- but that fiasco on the
museum-KATE WILLIAMS: Oh, don't.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: --was off the charts. And it cannot be trivialized. I mean, Director
Williams is not the only one that received death threats from people that weren't even in
Colorado. And you know, that I think was the most glaring, troubling misstep I've ever seen,
ever.

BOB BROOM: OK. [INAUDIBLE] Vince?
VINCE BUZEK: OK. One of the things is conducts regularly scheduled team building sessions
with the Board. Because I don't know what that is, I would guess it hasn't happened. So I mean,
that's just one more thing. And I want to just follow up on what Director Whitmore talked about,
that meeting that we were at where things fell apart.
They didn't just hedge. They interrupted Director Whitmore and stopped him and said, no, no,
no, no. This is what we're saying. It's 2020.
And to say it was embarrassing and humiliating is an understatement. It was terrible. And then
when I asked questions about where did this message come from, the response I got was, where
did the first quarter of 2020 come from? I never heard that.
TROY WHITMORE: That's absolutely right.
VINCE BUZEK: It had been in seven printed material packets for meetings that we had done in
local communities first quarter 2020.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
VINCE BUZEK: And then the response I got was I never heard that. First quarter 2020? So
either-- I'm done.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I've heard it from Mr. Stopplecamp plenty of times.
VINCE BUZEK: I've heard it from him and Director Genova and other people.
BOB BROOM: Director Cook?
VINCE BUZEK: It was very frustrating [INAUDIBLE].
SHELLEY COOK: Speaking specifically about leadership, the National Medal of Honor
Museum, where he won where if Dave and/or our Chair were interacting with the outside folks
on that, that would've been something where you would expect him to be more engaged and
involved. But that's not the only case where I've noted it anyway. And that's most recently with
the budget.
As I understand it, were upside down. We're heading into troubles if we're not over there. And
yet from what I can tell, in prior years, the GM has been silent on or has brought forward a
recommendation that the Board has mainly assented to.
And so what I'm seeing is a lack of his leadership in addition to Heather's. I don't see him leading
stuff like that when it's really the vital pieces of what we do. So I would just add that to that
piece right there.

TROY WHITMORE: And Mr. Chair, stop me if this isn't appropriate. But there was a comment
that I thought was something that I have thought about, but didn't ever voice in regard to
Heather's role. And I thought it was very insightful in light of some of the issues we have.
She appears to be Chief HR Officer and Chief IT Officer, as well as a tremendous pressure
packed job as CFO. And it seems like there's not a senior person, at least that we've been
exposed to, that works in that HR in that troublesome problem that we have and maybe a little bit
on IT. And I kind of wonder if the organization is struggling, because she has got so much
responsibility. I thought that was a very good statement. Are you following what I'm saying?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: But Director Whitmore, that was my statement.
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: And I've been talking about that position for a long time. And I think, you
know, if she's going to have three executive jobs, she should be paid appropriately for those. But
it's not fair for any one human to try to do all of those things.
And I don't care how much of a genius Heather is, I think it's an unfair responsibility. She is
meant to be the CFO. And if we need a CIO and an HR person, then we need that. But those
responsibilities are currently under her.
SHELLEY COOK: And the decision about how that's structured is the GM's.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: That's correct.
TROY WHITMORE: Well, I appreciate Claudia putting it in. [INAUDIBLE].
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If I might, just one last comment about the National Medal of
Honor Museum. For me, it was really a very devastating experience. I had Mayor Hancock call
me at 8:00 AM the next morning screaming at me, embarrassed that I did not vote in the
affirmative for the City of Denver and told me that Mr. Genova had promised him eight votes.
And I said to him that was incorrect information. So really I'm just so concerned about how the
decisions are being made and who's making them and who is part of that process.
BOB BROOM: OK. One last bite of the apple, and then we're going to vote.
KATE WILLIAMS: Excuse me. There's one last-LYNN GUISSINGER: I have one comment on the National Medal of Honor Museum is that I
got a call from the Governor's Chief of Staff, Lisa Kaufman, telling me how important this was
to the Governor. And Dave was going to those meetings. I called Dave, and told him that. And

he said he would follow up and call her. And he never did and didn't bring that back to the Board
that this was important to the Governor. It was left us to argue that in the meeting.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: Excuse me. Did you-- you talked to the Governor's office before we had the
first vote? And they told you it was important?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, after.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, after. OK. OK. I just wanted to make sure I understood that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lesson learned.
DOUG TISDALE: Because I was talking with the Governor a lot after the vote, because the
Governor and Mayor Hancock certainly abused me.
LYNN GUISSINGER: But that should have been brought to us-- the problem was that we were
not given the information that was needed that this was so important to everybody around us.
BOB BROOM: And that's why I tried to postpone the vote.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Right.
BOB BROOM: Chanel?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Shontel. Director Lewis, actually. But we'll go with Shontel today.
[LAUGHTER]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Lieutenant Colonel, to you.
KATE WILLIAMS: That's what he said, isn't it?
TROY WHITMORE: I think I called him Bob instead of Mr. Chair.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No, I call you all by your first name.
TROY WHITMORE: I started it.
SHONTEL LEWIS: One thing that I wanted to add as a new elected with the University of
Colorado A line is there have been ample opportunity for Dave and staff to be proactive in our
communication. And there have been times where I have received numerous complaints from my
constituents that Dave and staff have been aware of and hadn't made me aware of. And so I was

kind of blindsided and going into conversations without having the information that I needed,
which is why I ended up scheduling biweekly meetings with Dave so that I could be proactive in
that.
DOUG TISDALE: And let me ask you, because I think that is part of some leadership I'd like to
know. I mean, he has been meeting with you at least on the telephone twice a month for how
long?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Well, not twice a month, sometimes he cancels and isn't able to reschedule.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, well once or twice a month for how long?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I think I scheduled them in maybe June?
DOUG TISDALE: OK, so the past six months?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: That was not his leadership to be clear.
KATE WILLIAMS: That was her leadership.
SHONTEL LEWIS: That was my leadership.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. No, I know.
BOB BROOM: OK. Let's vote on this, and we'll move on.
JUDY LUBOW: Did you get your answer, Doug?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Oh, I did.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: I certainly did.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Core goal three is on page 14.
DOUG TISDALE: I'm going to take a point in personal privilege here, be right back.
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
BOB BROOM: OK, comments?

[SIDE CONVERSATION]
BOB BROOM: Comments?
VINCE BUZEK: Core goal three.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We're on number three.
[? NATALIE MENTEN: ?] Strong financial management, well, this is one that everybody
should be talking.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah. I mean, we're [INAUDIBLE] quite a bit.
[INAUDIBLE] some of it's been addressed.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm happy to-VINCE BUZEK: I'll start if that's OK. Strong financial management, but the achieving goal, it
sounds like it's a compliance issue when it's really more than just do you comply with presenting
a budget, you know? It's more than that. And even the General Manager's own comments go
beyond compliance.
So I was a little confused in the way this was structured, the way the core goal was described,
and whether it was a need improvement, achieve goal, and so forth. Seemed to be more, if you
just fill out some forms, you've met your goal, when it's I think much more than that.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] [INAUDIBLE]
JEFF WALKER: We've had that discussion before about the breadth of these goals. For some,
I've heard that before. But these are based on the job description. And the job description doesn't
necessarily have a component in it. The job description doesn't have a component in it where
they have to achieve certain measures, other than making sure that we are in compliance with the
various regulations.
VINCE BUZEK: Right, but his own self-evaluation goes beyond just the compliance stuff and
goes into performance. And I think from looking at the overall stuff, I think a lot of the
comments dealt with things more than just compliance.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And it says leading to a balanced budget, which means-VINCE BUZEK: Well, sure, we've got a balanced budget right now even though we had to slash
$40 million.

LYNN GUISSINGER: [INAUDIBLE] this year or next year, yeah.
BOB BROOM: So financial management means you get a clean audit and you have good
relationships with your rating agencies. It's a fairly broad term.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. It also means you're strong and thriving and successful financially I
think. I mean, and it's more than just compliance if there's an element of performance beyond
just you're compliance.
JEFF WALKER: So some of the other things that we talked about in previous years is that there
are some things that he can control, the agency can control. And the agency cannot control-- we
can't control how much people spend year after year. But he has come to us with a balanced
budget for 2020. In the side, I work for a department. The whole department budget with my
salary, that was it. I bought a computer. So the CFO for the city did some magic. And I had a
balanced budget again. So we do have a balanced budget. Your point is well-taken. I do
understand it. But he's-VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate that.
JEFF WALKER: My review is achieved, because I think he's at the goal.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BOB BROOM: OK.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Any other comments?
VINCE BUZEK: No, that's all I had. Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Let's go ahead and vote.
PEGGY CATLIN: Mr. Chair, this is Peggy.
BOB BROOM: Hello, Peggy.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, hi Peggy.
PEGGY CATLIN: I do have a comment on that.
BOB BROOM: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: You know, the Board bears some responsibility for that. Because that's one of
our chief primary responsibilities is fiscal responsibility. And I was reviewing our financial
policy that we approved.

And in that financial policy, it states that we will use the Leeds School of Business forecast. And
no where in our financial policy does it say that-- in fact, our staff is not supposed to create
forecasts for the sales revenue-- sales tax for revenues or ridership. Our Board policy that we
passed specifically states that.
So the staff is bound by what we task. And that is that we would use the Leeds forecast. That
being said, we of the Board could direct staff to consider those forecasts. But in their judgment,
would they like to prepare a budget that was more conservative?
But I think we need to take some responsibility and provide some leadership to them and really
take a serious look at the financial policy-- or fiscal policy, excuse me. So that's my little-- I'll get
off my soapbox now.
BOB BROOM: Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Good point.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, that was great
BOB BROOM: Thank you.
JUDY LUBOW: This is Judy. I agree with Peggy. I think that the Board-- I think a lot of people
share responsibility for a lot of what's going on. But nonetheless, the General Manager is the
point person and gets paid the most to make sure that this agency runs well.
And as far as I'm concerned, when I look at and see the requirements oversee the development of
the annual budget and financing plans for the future, to me implied in there is that it's a healthy
budget and that we are financially healthy.
SHELLEY COOK: Agreed. Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I agree, yes.
SHONTEL LEWIS: One thing that I'd like to mention is one of the things that I haven't seen as a
member of this Board is how we all address the deferred projects list. That list continuous to
grow, and we have yet to see a plan on how might we fund some of those projects. And we could
talk about that later in this evaluation, because I bring it up. But I think that's important for
strong financial management as well. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: For me, I really got stuck on the potential litigation and what we
may end up having to pay Denver Transit Partners, that whole processing. And I'm hearing
anything from $12 to $101 million. I mean, I don't know what it is. But it concerns me greatly
about how that's going to have an impact on our overall financial systability. [INAUDIBLE].
[? SHELLEY COOK: ?] Sustainability.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Sustainability, I put them both together.
VINCE BUZEK: Forgot a syll-ah-ble.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
[LAUGHTER]
But was trying to [INAUDIBLE].
BOB BROOM: OK. It's 4:30, let's keep moving.
VINCE BUZEK: Number four.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Board page 17.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: Well, these are mostly positive comments, so does anybody want to comment?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I believe he achieved this goal.
[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] [INAUDIBLE] number 11.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: Page 17 [INAUDIBLE]. Page 22, core goal five. Needs improvement, anybody
want to expand on that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: It seems like we addressed it in some of the other comments.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I would agree.
SHONTEL LEWIS: One thing that I might add in terms of effective communication is, in Dave's
meeting with partners, I don't know if he's leveraged those relationships in a way that advances
or benefits the agency. And so I think that's an opportunity for growth and development.
DOUG TISDALE: And I'm sorry, where were you on that? It sounds like a good comment. But
expand that again, please? I just had trouble hearing.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah. So I know that-- and I can read my full comment if you'd like. But I
know one of the things that Dave has talked about is that he's proactively going out to meet with
other thought leaders.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.

SHONTEL LEWIS: And I'm not sure if Dave has utilized those relationships in a way that could
advance the agency or move us forward in a positive direction.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, I agree.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Or useful, maybe not positive.
DOUG TISDALE: Thanks.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. Let's go ahead and vote on this.
BARBARA MCMANUS: 38 is the next page.
DOUG TISDALE: Page 38.
BOB BROOM: Safety and security-- achieve goal. [? This is our ?] number one [INAUDIBLE].
SHONTEL LEWIS: No, I think-BOB BROOM: Claudia?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you. I've had conversations with our AGM of Safety and Security,
Mr. Meader. And it has been made clear to me that-- well, he mentioned it to me in that I asked
him for a copy of it. But in a ranking of transit agencies in America, we rank, like, number five
and in America for the top unsafest, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Unsafest?
BOB BROOM: Top unsafest.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yeah. And we have had some pretty severe problems in our system. And I
know that Mr. Meader would appreciate a full-time employee to analyze the data, so that they
can identify where those problem areas are and get ahead of it. But we're not putting the
resources necessary to make our systems safe. And that's the security thing, not just other unsafe
problems. But, you know, [INAUDIBLE].
BOB BROOM: Other comments?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I did put that he achieved this goal. And I'll end on two comments. And one,
this is an area I think that Dave actually excels.
And I think there is an opportunity, as we're thinking about operator shortages, how you might
address the on-the-job injuries, as we're seeing an increase in that. One of the things I read
recently is that there is one full-time mental health professional that is employed in-[INTERPOSING VOICES]

SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah. And I just thought that was really, really cool, particularly as we are
looking at what to do with our unhoused neighbors. So I just thought kudos for that.
BOB BROOM: [INAUDIBLE]?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: My only piece has to do-- I also put that this was an achieved
goal, because I think this is Dave's strong point. But the one thing is about training for officers
that are working for us to have cultural sensitivity training just working with diverse
communities. It's something that I've talked with Mr. Meader about as well. So that's my only
comment on that.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. Let's vote.
DOUG TISDALE: And I'm sorry, let me just come back on this one and say, in fact-- again, just
trying to deal with this based upon the rules we set up for Dave, we said exceeded expectations
you just have to have one of these things.
And one of them is to complete live video capability on all buses. We said if you hit that mark,
you get an exceeded expectations. He hit that mark. We have live video capability on all buses.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] [INAUDIBLE]
DOUG TISDALE: I mean, if you want to say no, I just don't want to give him one on general
principles. OK, at least say that out loud. Or say, I disagree with that standard. We shouldn't have
approved that. Or say, yes, he exceeded expectations. It's got to be one of those three.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] He's got live video capability on every bus?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
[? ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: ?] Really?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well, capability versus is it actually working and doing what it's intended
to do?
DOUG TISDALE: Well, in so far as I am aware, yes. It is intended to. Now, is there potentially a
glitch somewhere? I suppose that could happen. But he has reported to us, and I have heard from
others, he has completed live video capability on all buses for ability to view one camera on each
bus at the Security Command Center. And I'm [? seeing here-- ?]
BOB BROOM: Plus, he has to meet all the achieved goals.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, yeah. Yes. That is correct. So if you see one that you don't think he
achieved, but I just heard consensus for achieved goals. And you only have to hit one other thing
to hit an exceed.

VINCE BUZEK: I'll change my vote.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
TROY WHITMORE: So [INAUDIBLE] in [INAUDIBLE].
BOB BROOM: Page 43, is next?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, task goals, all right. Number two.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Page 42.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, 42, 43.
JUDY LUBOW: Page 42?
BARBARA MCMANUS: And 43.
JUDY LUBOW: [INAUDIBLE]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: And this has got a needs improvement. Any comments?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I have question.
BOB BROOM: Sure.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: So we've hired a woman. Her name is Dr. Ruth-- I don't know her last
name.
BARBARA MCMANUS: She's no longer with us.
JEFF WALKER: She's not here anymore.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Oh, OK. So she's not there.
DOUG TISDALE: Who?
BOB BROOM: Dr. Ruth.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well, this person was supposed to improve our human capital situation.
But she's not here, so OK.
JUDY LUBOW: What happened to Dr. Ruth?

JEFF WALKER: She went to Xcel.
BOB BROOM: I haven't heard.
JUDY LUBOW: What?
JEFF WALKER: She went to Xcii.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, OK. Thank you.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BOB BROOM: [INAUDIBLE] goal number two, any comments?
[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] [INAUDIBLE] two?
BARBARA MCMANUS: [INAUDIBLE] two, page 42.
DOUG TISDALE: Page 42 and 43, and then Dave's comments [INAUDIBLE].
BOB BROOM: Going, going?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: [INAUDIBLE] they are not captured in the criteria necessarily, but I think
where we are with regard to the shortages has to be a part of [INAUDIBLE].
LYNN GUISSINGER: It has to [INAUDIBLE].
JEFF WALKER: That's in the exceeded.
SHELLEY COOK: [INAUDIBLE] run [INAUDIBLE] process [INAUDIBLE] regarding service
delivery and headcount available. OK, good point.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We haven't incrementally taken care of the problem.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'll comment.
SHELLEY COOK: With pretty significant consequences.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'll comment. I believe this is an area in which there is the most opportunity
for a successful outcome. General Manager Genova has been keenly aware of the impacts of the
six-day mandates. And to his credit, he has explored ideas in how they might recruit more
operators.

I do believe he has gone to great lengths to explore incentives to recruit. The opportunity for
General Manager Genova lies in his ability to implement and execute in that exploration along
the same lines of workforce, particularly the lack of racial diversity within the agency and
particularly with the senior leadership team. He is an opportunity for successful leadership
planning to assure that we are diversifying our workforce, implementing strategies to address
retention, and succession planning, which we have not seen today. General Manager Genova has
shared both the union pension and salary pensions. While we remain strong on the salary side,
there is true opportunity for improvement for our represented employees.
BOB BROOM: Claudia?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes. Thank you. Director Lewis, just in case, I may or may not be clear
on what I just heard you say. But I think that General Manager Genova has a succession plan.
And it is that Mike Meader would be the acting CEO if he should be removed or go away for
whatever reason.
Now, with that said, I think that's inappropriate. It seems to me that the person who would fill
that position should be the COO.
SHONTEL LEWIS: So I would just like to clarify. When I say succession planning, I'm talking
about for the full agency. So as we're looking at folks retiring, where is that information going?
How are we preparing for that information? How are we ensuring that the agency is racially
diverse, socially, economically diverse? And so more of not an individual-- and I agree, that is
inappropriate. Not an individual, but, like, how are we paying preparing for that as an agency?
BOB BROOM: Mr. Chair?
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a question, I think I understand it. Is that
comment intended to support the fact that you think he should be scored needs improvement,
because he hasn't updated departmental succession and leadership plans? Or is it an achieved
goal? I just want to make clear, because I didn't understand it.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I was just making a general observation with all of the things that I look for.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: But I will tell you for that one I scored-- hold on. I just flipped from the
page-- needs improvement.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. Again, and I'm just trying to make sure that I-- because we've got to
communicate this to Dave.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Sure.

DOUG TISDALE: Which of these bullets on page 42 is it that warrants a needs improvement? It
can just be one of them. It only has to be one in order to hit a needs improvement. So there is no
problem.
SHONTEL LEWIS: So I actually named a few of them.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: The Board and union salary pension plans was one where there was an
opportunity. Update departmental succession and leadership plans was another opportunity that I
believed that Dave could benefit from. And then in terms of address human capital, I spoke about
the operator shortages, which you can go down to the last two bullets.
DOUG TISDALE: I'm trying to see it. Because I see the first two. So you're saying that he's-SHONTEL LEWIS: That should be sufficient, because he only has to hit one.
DOUG TISDALE: No, I know. That's my point, yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: And you're saying he hasn't hit the pension. I thought he had actually. But the
updated departmental succession, I hear what you're saying. OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And incrementally optimized service and [INAUDIBLE] Board process
to be bring balance regarding service delivery and headcount available.
DOUG TISDALE: Which?
LYNN GUISSINGER: The second to last one.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I don't think we've been incrementally taking the steps [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: [INAUDIBLE] solve the problem.
SHONTEL LEWIS: And that's how we got back [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG TISDALE: Right, oh there was headcount available.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: I couldn't see.

SHONTEL LEWIS: It's OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: It's OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you. All right. Yeah, OK. I see it. Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you. One of the things that I've noticed is that when the staff does bring
a recommendation for service changes, sometimes there is an addition of ours sometimes that's in
that production. Sometimes there is a balance of both.
A lot of times, we argue in favor of routes that serve our districts, generally speaking. So we
have approved a lot of hours that staff has not recommended that we have out there. If I can pick
some low hanging fruit?
[? BARBARA MCMANUS: ?] Please.
JEFF WALKER: The R line, for instance, that's running 15 minute headways all day every day-not all day, but during the daytime hours from Peoria down to RidgeGate. And I think last time I
checked it was 5,000 boardings an hour-- a day, a day. Those are a lot of operators. That's a lot
of hours that could be put towards other places. And that's part of the reason why we have this
operator shortage, because we, the Board, has not voted to allocate resources where-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
TROY WHITMORE: Let him finish. Let him finish.
JEFF WALKER: So that's just one example. But that's happened time and time again with, now,
flex rides, used to be [INAUDIBLE] rides, various bus routes, et cetera. The W line, when that
opened, there was a whole lot of bus service that went back in to that one. So we voted on this
stuff. The Board has. And so some of these shortcomings and operator headcount are our
responsibility, because we haven't managed to the conditions of the larger economy. Now, I'm
done.
SHELLEY COOK: Fair enough.
Can I speak? Can I?
BOB BROOM: Sure.

NATALIE MENTEN: The R line is a big problem with feds. The feds are requiring that
headway, just making that on the record, because we've got conversations going with them.
Because of the federal money going down on that Southeast tail of it, they're the problem. And
I'd love to know when we're going to get past that. So I think Dave's having communic-- just
clearing that one up that that's a hurdle we won't be able to change.
JEFF WALKER: Right. The proposal was to have 15 minute increment just down to Florida on
the new section of it, not all the way down to the end to the Southeast line.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Can I ask a clarifying question? Are you saying from January to up until
now that's been proposed to the Board, and we haven't acted on that? Or are you just saying
historically?
JEFF WALKER: Historically.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Got it.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
[? BARBARA MCMANUS: ?] Good question.
[? LYNN GUISSINGER: ?] Did you pizza?
DOUG TISDALE: Where are you parked?
[LAUGHTER]
BOB BROOM: Page-[? TROY WHITMORE: ?] Short-term?
Short-term.
BOB BROOM: 46.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
KATE WILLIAMS: Where is our parking?
BOB BROOM: Ensure fiscal sustainability. Comments?
[? TROY WHITMORE: ?] No comment, not with this. [INAUDIBLE].
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

BOG BROOM: Going once? Going twice? Let's vote.
SHELLEY COOK: You know, you can offer your ship within its protocols and run it into a rock.
So I'm not sure that the criteria listed are capturing what we really expect from the CEO in terms
of the agency's fiscal financial wherewithal.
DOUG TISDALE: Mr. Chair?
BOB BROOM: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: You know, that's a very legitimate observation. It's a challenge. And the
problem is-- and I don't mean to kind of jump on people when I say, well, OK, fine. This is what
you approved. But at some point, you know, this is what we approved. General Manager
manages to that.
But you're right that sense of nuance, that sense of subtlety associated with what those standards
are is something that we expect from a General Manager, a CEO, in any company. Certainly any
company I've ever been associated with or represented, you expect that. And I hear you that, I
think in large part, from a lot of the directors that, OK, fine. These are the standards.
And your comment is you can operate a ship according to protocols and still drive it into the
rocks. And I hear that that's, as much as anything, what's driving a lot of this. And we have to be
able to communicate to Dave that nuance.
Now, some of that is saying to him try to read the Board's mind. And that's perhaps unfair. But
some of it is, you know, that's why you get paid the big bucks. Try to read the Board's mind.
SHELLEY COOK: No, I don't think that's what I'm asking him to do at all. I think that
underlying our criteria is the assumption that he'll do the best thing for this agency with regard to
our finances. And he is largely mute on that. When we have presentations, they are by Heather.
If we're doing something wrong with regard to our overall direction, you don't hear from Dave.
So I think if we're all basing our votes on that, we assume there's assent there. That's what he
wants us to do. So anyway, go ahead. Sorry.
JUDY LUBOW: No, go ahead.
LYNN GUISSINGER: The number three there, work collaboratively with partners and
stakeholders to identify possible efficiencies and identify possible opportunities to enhance
revenue and reduce costs, I think as an agency we have a long way to go to really work with our
partners who come up to us with good ideas. And I don't think that's certainly all Dave's fault.
But he hasn't shifted and moved us forward with a vision that lets us work well with our local
and state governments in terms of collaborators for these sorts of things.
BOB BROOM: We had two in the queue. [INAUDIBLE]. Kate?

KATE WILLIAMS: I'd like to point out that the reason that this document is so large is because
I perceive that David has named everything that has been done in the agency. And I think that
there's 2,700 employees here. He could name 2,700 things when, in fact, you know, he didn't do
all these things. His staff did these things. And I think, if we held Dave to the real big goals
instead of all these finite details, that he would be more able to fulfill his job description.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you. I agree with Kate. I have two comments. One is that we see every
month all these events that our General Manager goes to. And in a certain sense, it's admirable,
but it's bean counting.
What we're really paying the big bucks for is to prevent us getting into big trouble. And we're in
big trouble. I don't care about the bean counting. I really don't care.
And all of this, a lot of it's bean counting. Because we didn't know how to do this. We're all
learning.
But I think in the future I would like to see him, any manager, responsible for keeping the agency
running well. We don't have that here. You know, it's just not in there. It's, like, it's ridiculous.
So I find this standard-- and I've always found it. I've always found the standard irrelevant to my
feeling about how the General Manager is doing. But I didn't know how to fix it.
I think now in my eighth year-- I've been here longer than God has. I have more of a sense of just
basic what are the big goals. That's what you should be held to, none of this bullshit. Sorry.
[? KATE WILLIAMS: ?] [INAUDIBLE] out there. Whoops.
DOUG TISDALE: Chair?
[? KATE WILLIAMS: ?] Beep, beep.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, you're [INAUDIBLE].
JUDY LUBOW: I'm not. I'm not done. But I'd also like in particular to talk about that I think
implied in presenting a balanced annual budget is that it's a strong budget showing the agency
being strong. Similarly with minimizing debt, when I heard that we're not going to be able to
balance our budget six years from now, I realized there's something very wrong here, you know?
And so we're not minimizing debt effectively. We might have done it on the annual budget, but
not in a way that we're a sound organization. And so I don't think-- I think there's a need
improvement. That's what I voted for anyway. Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Chair?
DOUG TISDALE: It was perhaps as much an editorial comment as a substantive comment. But
just in response to Director Williams saying, well, you can't take credit for all the achievements

if somebody else has done it, isn't it then fair to say, by that very same logic, it isn't fair for you
to take a bullet if somebody else had?
KATE WILLIAMS: Nope, the buck stops on his desk. And he is ultimately responsible.
DOUG TISDALE: So it only works one way.
KATE WILLIAMS: That is correct. Leadership is [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG TISDALE: OK. I just wanted to understand. You don't get credit for anything your
employees have done, but you take all the blame for everything they've done. Is that-KATE WILLIAMS: That is not what I said.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: What I said is I do not believe that we need to read a bullet here that says
Dave Genova provided 100% of requested Access-a-Ride trips. No, he did not. There are a
number of people in the agency who did. Let me give you another bullet.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
KATE WILLIAMS: You know?
DOUG TISDALE: This is helpful.
KATE WILLIAMS: So this document is, you know, just documenting every steps that RTD did.
And Dave did not do these things. His staff did these things. And it would be fine if this
document said, the staff of the Access-a-Ride department, who reports to the AGM who reports
to me, did these things. But Dave Genova did not do them.
DOUG TISDALE: No, you answered my question. I thank you.
BOB BROOM: OK. Have we voted now on core task goal number three?
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
BOB BROOM: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Page 49.
BOB BROOM: Task four, rule four-- address future transportation needs and methods. On this,
the majority rule is exceed expectations? Are there any problem areas, though?
JUDY LUBOW: There's another one. Dave completed State Highway 119. Wow.

BOB BROOM: Let's vote.
JEFF WALKER: Which-- I'm sorry. [INAUDIBLE] ask a question?
BOB BROOM: Sure.
JEFF WALKER: Director Williams, which page is that on and which bullet?
KATE WILLIAMS: [INAUDIBLE] several times.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Achieve goal number two.
BOB BROOM: Number 40, page 49.
DOUG TISDALE: Page 49?
JEFF WALKER: No. Director Williams just called our a bullet. And I'm just-KATE WILLIAMS: Bullet number two-- complete State Highway 119 BRT preliminary
engineering.
JEFF WALKER: What page?
SHONTEL LEWIS: 49, at the top.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Page 49, [INAUDIBLE] achieve the goal-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: Oh, OK. OK. I'm sorry.
SHONTEL LEWIS: But what you're asking is that it's in the accomplishments on page 50.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, yeah. That's what I was looking at, OK.
KATE WILLIAMS: Sorry.
JEFF WALKER: OK, yeah.
BOB BROOM: Moving right on-JUDY LUBOW: Yeah, right.
BOB BROOM: Page 52, our final task goal number five, [? most ?] rating was achieved goal.
Ensure asset management, state of good repair, any comments?

BOB BROOM: The deferred projects?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
BOB BROOM: [INAUDIBLE]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: What are you referring to? Where do you see deferred projects?
SHONTEL LEWIS: So that list continues to grow. And so when we talk about maintain RTD
assets and infrastructures for preventative maintenance programs and mid-term financial
[INAUDIBLE]-DOUG TISDALE: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I was just making mention of how do we start to-DOUG TISDALE: Deferred maintenance.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah-- address the differed projects, that growing list.
BOB BROOM: OK. Any comments? [? Let's ?] [? not ?] vote. And we'll turn these in.
VINCE BUZEK: Do we peel off the top page that has our name? Or are we not anonymous on
the Board, on this Committee? I don't care, but I'm just curious.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So you'll get these back next time. Your name is on it, so you can get
back.
DOUG TISDALE: So you get that one back.
