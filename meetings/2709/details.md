### D. Election of 2018 Board Officers

Chair Hoy remarked that, as stated in the Board Bylaws, in the first official meeting of the year the Board elects the Officers of Chair, First Vice Chair, Second Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer. Barbara McManus provided each Board member with a copy of the rules of engagement for the nomination and election of Officers in accordance with RTD’s Bylaws and Robert’s Rules of Order. The election begins with the position of Chair and worked through the process to all Executive Committee seats. Board members making the nominations, seconders, and any other requested speakers would be given three minutes to speak on behalf of their candidate for each position.

Chair Hoy noted he would ask for other nominations and, when there were no more nominations, the nominations would close and votes would be cast by secret ballot. Two Board members who were not running for the position, along with General Counsel would count the votes and provide the tally back to the Chair Pro Tem for announcement. He added that, if no candidate receives eight affirmative votes, the vote process would be repeated. Chair Hoy said that, should the vote go into multiple rounds, Board members who wished to speak further on behalf of a candidate with new or additional information to share could do so. He stated the vote would be done in round-robin fashion and each speaker would be limited to three minutes.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated, if Chair Hoy planned to run for the office of Chair again that the meeting be run by First Vice Chair Francone.

Chair Hoy stated that would be the process, if he were nominated he would hand the meeting over to First Vice Chair Francone.

Chair Hoy asked if there were any other nominees.

Director Folska, Ph.D., called a point of order and an explanation of Roberts Rules stating that it was inappropriate for Chair Hoy to be conducting the election and requested the Board to pass the gavel to First Vice Chair Francone.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, explained that it was not improper and that Robert’s Rules stated that the Chair should not hesitate to put the question to a motion to appoint officers or elect delegates even if he was included.

#### 1. Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement with the newly approved officer signatures.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Sisk stated that he had been on the Wells Fargo Board of Advisors and that recent allegations in the way that the Wells Fargo corporate offices had conducted themselves had been deplorable and he would like the agency no longer bank with Wells Fargo. He added that he would vote no because voting yes condoned actions of Wells Fargo.

Director Menten requested more information regarding the Wells Fargo allegations. She asked about why the recommended action had not gone through the normal process of approval through the Financial Administration and Audit Committee.

Ms. McKillop, Chief Finance Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, explained that the wording in the motion was not supposed to have read that it was recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee. She added that the motion was done at the Special Board meeting due to the election on new officers and the need to immediately have the new signatories on file.

Chair Hoy asked what would happen if the Board voted no on the motion.

General Counsel Asphaug explained that there would not be a method for new officers to sign checks and that would be a problem. He added that if there was a need to change banks that would be addressed at another time.

Director Sisk stated that there was information that was readily available regarding Wells Fargo and that there had been some discrepancies that may be illegal.

Director Williams stated that there were some issues, but that the meeting tonight was to approve the signatories not to address the issues surrounding Wells Fargo.

Director Anderson seconded Director Sisk and stated that she had removed assets from Wells Fargo, but that the Board must move to approve the motion and would be voting yes.

Director Tisdale stated that maybe we need to start looking for another bank.

Director Francone stated that she would support voting yes but requested that more information be presented and the issue be resolved in a timely manner.

#### 1. Safety Management Systems (SMS) Framework

Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer, recognized Shirley Bennett, Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental, Richard Lobato, Manager of Safety, and Skyler Mott, Safety Compliance Officer, stating they were part of the Safety Team. He then provided an overview of the Safety Management Systems (SMS) framework presentation, and highlighted the following items from the presentation:

- The SMS is part of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) effort to improve safety in public transportation. The FTA mandated the use of the SMS defined as a “formal, data driven, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risks and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk mitigations”.

- The purpose behind the SMS is to “improve public transportation safety and provide transit agencies with a structure for understanding and addressing safety risks through proactive and timely organizational decision-making… [The system] proactively detects safety concerns and organizational factors, and corrects them using data-driven prioritization.”

- Traditional Safety

o        Management reviews accident/injury/incident data and decides that the rates are too high, then directs safety to implement tactics to reduce rates.

o        Reactive to accidents and incidents: Individual focus

o        Safety solely in the hands of the Safety Department

- System Safety

o        Proactive approach – Reporting, Data, Trend Analysis

o        Focus on management and organizational systems

o        Continuous management process that spreads throughout the organization – Safety, Responsibility, and Accountability.

- Critical Concerns

o        Two Types of Accidents

§         Individual Accidents

- Those resulting from the actions or inactions of people

o        Organizational Accidents

§          Those resulting from actions or inactions of organization

o        SMS addresses both types of accidents

- Public Transportation Safety Program Regulations

o        MAP-21(Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act): FTA was directed to establish a Public Transportation Safety Program to strengthen the performance of the public transportation safety industry

o        Adopt the Safety Management System as the basis for the FTA’s new Public Transportation Safety Programs

§         - NPRM: 49 CFR Part 670: Docket No. FTA-2015-0009

§         http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-08-15/pdf/2015-20021.pdf

o        Colorado PUC is our State Safety Oversight

§         49 CFR Part 674: State Safety Oversight Program Standard

- Why the Safety Management System?

o        SMS allows public transportation agencies to examine how organizational factors contribute to incidents, accidents and near misses.

o        Organizational factors include how an agency:

§         Allocates its resources

§         Defines and establishes operational procedures

§         Supervises frontline personnel

§         Trains staff

§         Collects and Analyzes data

§         Resolves human performance issues

- SMS helps answer questions we should be asking:

o        What are our most serious safety concerns?

o        How do we know this?

o        What are we doing about it?

o        Is what we are doing working?

o        How do we know what we are doing is working?

- SMS Framework Components

o        There are four SMS Framework Components (The Four SMS Pillars)

1.       Safety Management Policy

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked how the SMS program would interface with CDOT and local jurisdictions within the district.

Mr. Meader stated that he personally works with the airport and CDOT and meets with other agencies and districts regularly regarding SMS implementation.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if the SMS had been woven together throughout agencies and districts.

Mr. Meader explained that they were not directly woven together because it was not currently mandated to do so.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that it seemed like an excellent opportunity during the implementation and development of the program to fully integrate it with all agencies. She also asked if there was live camera feed from different locations within the district, especially parking structures or large hub areas.

Mr. Meader explained that, from an emergency management perspective, RTD and other agencies were woven together and that the agencies do joint exercises with other agencies and from an emergency management stand point. He added that RTD does have live feed cameras throughout the district that go to the security center.

Director Menten asked about the safety email address and if it was for the pubic.

Mr. Meader explained that the email was safety@rtd-denver.com and currently was only an internal email and that, once the infrastructure was in place, it would go public in order to report safety concerns.

Director Menten asked what the phone options were in order to report a safety concern.

Mr. Meader explained that RTD currently has the Transit Watch Application and the safety Hot Line number which was posted on the website and the security command center number was 303-299-2911.

Director Francone asked what were the possible legal implications of noncompliance with MAP-21 and when the transit plan was brought forth that it would be done with enough time for the Board to review.

Mr. Meader stated that the safety plan would definitely be presented with enough time for review. He requested an offline conversation regarding compliance with MAP-21.

General Manager Genova stated that the ultimate implication of noncompliance would be withholding of federal funds and that the agency had until April 2018 to receive FTA approval.

Director Broom stated that there was a recent rail accident and asked if there were mechanisms in place to pass on lessons learned from accidents or incidents to all transportation agencies.

Mr. Meader explained that there was an APTA Rail Safety Committee, Tracks Committee, that was a main driver for understanding rail accidents and policies commenting that General Manger Genova served on that committee for years. He added that both the FRA and FTA played a large role in sharing and reporting that information.

Director Deadwyler asked if the SMS was being sent to RTD contractors.

Mr. Meader explained that everyone that worked for RTD including contractors would be provided the information and be required to be trained and adhere to the SMS Plan.

General Manager Genova added that one of the new changes from the FTA was that oversight now applied to all transportation modes and would be included under the SMS plan.

Director Walker asked if the plan included identifying problem areas and determining how to resolve those issues. He added that it was incumbent upon the Board to support these programs financially in order to increase safety across the agency.

Mr. Meader stated that the program enables RTD to analyze and mitigate safety concerns.

Director Solano requested that two safety concerns that had been expressed to him be addressed regarding the number of security personnel on Route 88 and the response from the RTD Safety , Security, and Asset Management Department.
