IV.

Retiree Awards
Chair Hoy stated that there were a number of retirees for the month of December and
asked the General Manager and staff to present the retirees.
General Manager Genova asked Bruce Abel to approach the podium.
Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, noted that the first retiree of the evening was Anita Davidson. He said that
Ms. Davidson was retiring after 29 years of service to the district and she first served as a
bus operator and then as a revenue instructor. He noted that her retirement plans included
traveling to Albania to work for the World English Institute.
Ms. Davidson commented that the retiree award meant a lot to her. She added that
sometimes drivers get on the road and do not realize how important their jobs were to
everyone else. She said that she remembered one time when a man kept saying that he
was going to blow his wife away and she asked if he had any children and what would
happen to them and to him if he did that. She said that RTD serves many people day-today from all walks of life and the agency has so many neat things going on and it had
been great to have been a part of it.
Mr. Abel also recognized Gary Hull, who had 20 years of service with RTD. He thanked
Mr. Hull’s wife for sharing him with RTD for the past 20 years and said that Mr. Hull’s
retirement plans would include sleeping in late and working for RTD as a part time driver.
Mr. Hull said when he first started working for RTD people told him that 20 years would
fly by in the blink of an eye and they were right. He thanked RTD for the ability to provide
for his family and for all of the people he had met along the way.

Chair Hoy added that it was always great to see the people who had worked so hard for
RTD and noted that they are what made RTD a great organization.

Public Participation
Gary Van Dorn, Denver, said that he was speaking on behalf of the National Federation of
the Blind of Colorado (NFBCO). He commented that Civic Center Station was absolutely
gorgeous, but after exploring the station, he noted that half of the braille was incorrect or
that signage required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was missing. He stated
that the NFBCO was unhappy that proper signage was not installed or was incorrect, and
they were also dismayed that RTD did not consult with them in advance of Civic Center
Station’s re-opening. He stated that he would like to work directly with the General
Manager to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
Chair Hoy said that Mr. Van Dorn’s concerns would be investigated right away.
Chair Hoy added that Mr. Joe Triplett, a constituent who regularly attends Board
meetings, was unable to attend and asked that the Chair extend a happy holiday message
from him to the Board.

Chair Hoy said that college passes were offered through the respective universities or
colleges in the college pass program.
General Manger Genova noted that, for college passes, RTD had a master contract with
each college or university that opted into the program, and the cost of the pass was then
passed onto each student through their student fees, whether they used the pass or not.
Chair Hoy added that Front Range Community College did not like the concept of the all or
nothing pass, and that was why they were not participating in the college pass program.

Director Deadwyler asked if the article Director Broom mentioned was correct in that RTD
offered student passes at $24.50.
General Manager Genova said that any student up through high school, or age 19, could
get a 50% discount on a pass, and currently a local monthly pass would equate to $49.00
for K-12 students.

Director Tisdale stated that, in light of the circumstances the previous day in Washington,
he would like staff to provide information to the Board as it became available.
General Manager Genova noted that it was very early in the investigation, and that train
was not under Positive Train Control (PTC), whereas RTD’s system was.
Director Williams thanked Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, for her input earlier in the day at the Pass Program
Working Group (PPWG) and for all of her efforts in the process.

items A-G on the unanimous consent agenda.

Packet Pg. 28

Safety Management Systems
• As part of FTA’s new National Public Transportation Program, FTA
developed the Safety Management System (SMS) Framework, a “formal,
data driven, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety
risks and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk mitigations.”
• The purpose behind the SMS is to “improve public transportation safety
and provide transit agencies with a structure for understanding and
addressing safety risks through proactive and timely organizational
decision-making…[The system] proactively detects safety concerns and
organizational factors, and corrects them using data-driven prioritization.”

Why SMS? Traditional Safety vs. System
Safety
• Traditional Safety
- Management reviews accident/injury/incident data and decides that
the rates are to high, then directs safety to implement tactics to
reduce rates.
- Reactive to accidents and incidents: Individual focus
Executive
- Safety solely in the hands of the Safety Department
Management
Commitment
• System Safety
- Proactive approach – Reporting, Data, Trend Analysis
- Focus on management and organizational systems
- Continuous management process that spreads throughout the
organization – Safety Responsibility and Accountability.

Are we addressing both types of accidents?

organizational factors contribute to incidents, accidents and near
misses.
• Organizational factors include how an agency:
- Allocates its resources
- Defines and establishes operational procedures
- Supervises frontline personnel
- Trains staff
- Collects and Analyzes data
- Resolves human performance issues

SMS helps answer questions we should be asking:
• What are our most serious safety concerns?
• How do we know this?
• What are we doing about it?
• Is what we are doing working?
• How do we know what we are doing is working?
