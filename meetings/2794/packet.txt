From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

Subject:

Amendment to 2018 Amended Budget

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 3, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 to amend the
2018 Amended Budget for the Base System for 1) the inclusion of a new capital project, and 2) increase
to the appropriation.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
The revision to the appropriation in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Base System consists of a new
capital project for $21,733,160 for the continuing purchase of 27 Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs). Originally
approved in the 2018-2023 SBP, this project was inadvertently omitted from the new capital
appropriation in the 2018 Amended Budget. The purchase of the LRVs will be fully funded from
previously-issued COP (Certificate of Participation) funds.
The result of these revisions is an increase in the District-wide appropriation of $21.7 million to
$1,990.5 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.
Only the change to the Base System appropriation and District-wide appropriation is shown below. The
FasTracks appropriation is excluded because there are no changes to FasTracks. No change is made to
the estimated operating and non-operating revenue and neither is summarized below.

DISCUSSION
The project for the purchase of 27 LRVs to be made by the Base System was carried as a line item in
the approved 2018-2023 SBP. When developing the 2018 Budget, which uses the SBP as a basis, the
project funds scheduled to be drawn in 2018 were inadvertently omitted from the new capital

Packet Pg. 41

11.A

appropriation. The total project funds were to be drawn over a period of 3 years from 2016-2018.
Funds for 2016-2017 were programmed and appropriated in their respective budgets but funds for 2018
were missed, and there was not a sufficient amount to carry forward to cover the expenditure in 2018.
The purchase of the LRVs will be fully funded from previously-issued COP funds, which is already
included in the 2018 Budget. No new funding will be needed to complete this purchase.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Capital expenditures in Exhibit I for the Base System will be increased by $21,733,160. No
additional funding beyond previously-issued COP funds is needed to cover this expenditure in 2018.
The debt service reserves in the Net Position section of Exhibit I will be decreased by equal amount
to show use of COP proceeds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 to amend the
2018 Amended Budget for the Base System for 1) the inclusion of a new capital project, and 2)
increase to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
2. Do not amend the 2018 Amended Budget. This is not recommended because the 2018 Budget
would not reflect adjustments necessary and the purchase of the LRVs would not be completed.

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4

Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed 2019 Requested Budget to the
governing body on October 9, 2018. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2019
Requested Budget for public review on October 10, 2018. A public hearing to solicit formal public
comment for the 2019 Recommended Budget is scheduled for the November 27, 2018 regular meeting
of the Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 54

12.B

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2019 Recommended Budget (combined Base and
FasTracks) is $1,316.4 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $755.4 million, interest
expense of $152.1 million, capitalized interest of $21.4 million, new capital expenditures of $90.0
million, debt payments of $76.8 million, FasTracks management reserve of $0.9 million, FasTracks
Internal Savings Account of $84.9 million, contingency reserve of $5.0 million, Board-appropriated fund
of $39.8 million, capital replacement fund of $16.4 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4
million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $58.2 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry-forward) is $719.4 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry-forward
is $2,035.8 million.
Overview of the 2019 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,236.8 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $22.7 million (1.9%) in
2019 from the 2018 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $16.8
million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $45.5 million, and 3) an increase in investment income
of $3.9 million, offset by 1) a decrease in grant revenue of $42.9 million, and 2) a decrease in other
income of $0.6 million.








Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $163.6 million is budgeted to
increase 11.5% over the 2018 Amended Budget based on the fare change proposal
presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. The percentage increase
is higher than the fare rate increase that will take effect in 2019 because it is driven by
ridership growth on FasTracks, in part due to full-year ridership in 2019 on the G Line and
partial year ridership for SERE. Based on the model, a higher proportionate amount of fare
revenue is allocated to FasTracks and a lower amount is allocated to Base than in previous
periods.
o On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 8.8% over the 2018
Amended Budget to $125.3 million in 2019.
o For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 21.2% to $38.3 million over the
2018 budgeted amount.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat on Base with ridership increases attributed to
FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.1% in 2019 over that projected
for 2018.
Sales and use tax revenue of $668.3 million in 2019 is expected to increase 5.6% or
$45.5 million over the 2018 projected level according to the most recent September
quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $370.9
million, a decrease of $42.9 million from the 2018 Amended Budget.
o Total Base System grants are estimated to total $146.6 million in 2019; of that
amount, $103.2 million is new grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is
$43.4 million. Base System grants are projected to increase $3.9 million from the
2018 Amended Budget. This includes increases in FTA grants for capital maintenance
(5307), fixed guideway (5337), and bus facilities (5339), offset by some decreases in
CMAQ grants.
o FasTracks grants are budgeted at $224.3 million, which is a decrease of $46.8 million
from the 2018 Amended Budget. Of the amount, $224.3 is the projected carry-



forward grant funding to 2019. Operating grant revenue is estimated to decrease $2.9
million while capital grant revenue is estimated to decrease $43.8 million, a result of
project completion and the winding down of associated grant revenue.
Combined investment income of $15.7 million is projected to increase $3.9 million over
the 2018 Amended Budget due to expectation of higher interest rates on investable fund
balances.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $0.6 million from the
2018 Amended Budget. This recurring revenue is increased at the CPI but is offset by the
Build America Bonds subsidy which declines as the bonds are paid off. Other income also
includes payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line (FasTracks
Operations) and DUS rental income (Base).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $755.4 million on a combined basis in 2019 (excluding
depreciation), which is $55.0 million higher compared to the 2018 Amended Budget. Base System
operating expenses are budgeted to increase $13.0 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are
budgeted to decrease $4.3 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
increase $46.4 million.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the Mid-term
Financial Plan, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial
Plan, plus operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2018, and other miscellaneous increases
unknown at the time of the Mid-term Financial Plan. For FasTracks Project, the decrease is due to
completion of several FasTracks projects and capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors.
For FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to both direct costs and full allocation from Base
to FasTracks of costs of operating the new service corridors, including the opening of SERE and startup/operational costs for North Metro, and a higher estimated service payment to Denver Transit
Operators for Eagle partially due to the early implementation of the University of Colorado A line 4-car
consist in 2019 due to capacity issues. This accelerates by one year what was assumed in the
Concession agreement. For FasTracks, operating expenses are derived from the Mid-term Financial Plan.
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2019 is $30.3 million for Base System, $14.6 million for
FasTracks Project, and $5.5 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and maintenance projects
approved in the Mid-term Financial Plan for the Base System for 2019 total $7.6 million (in 2018
dollars). It should be noted that reductions were made overall to departmental operating budgets
including expense projects to bring expenditures into alignment with the Mid-term Financial Plan for Base
and FasTracks.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at an estimated price of $2.30 per gallon, compared to a budgeted price of
$2.20 per gallon in the 2018 Amended Budget, resulting in an incremental higher cost of
approximately $1.0 million over the 2018 budget. Senior staff is reviewing opportunities to lock
diesel at a favorable price for 2019. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.90/gallon in 2019 vs. $2.65/gallon
in the 2018 budget for an increase of $1.1 million coupled with an increase in gallons used.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of additions for approved Mid-Term Finanical Plan expense projects and expense
projects carry-forward, as well as costs for North Metro operations not finalized in the Requested
Budget.

Packet Pg. 56

12.B

The 2019 Recommended Budget includes funding for both start-up costs related to RTD operation
of the North Metro commuter rail line and costs for operations assuming August 1, 2019 start of
revenue service. This budget of approximately $24 million covers staffing, consumables and spare
parts to be purchased for maintenance of the infrastructure and passenger facilities, training and
other support needed to prepare for revenue service, power, security, vehicle maintenance,
insurance, and contingency.
Interest expense in 2018 is budgeted at $152.1 million on a combined basis, a decrease of $1.1
million from the 2018 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to the effect of refundings and
rescheduled amortization. Of total interest expense, $19.4 million is budgeted for Base System and
$132.8 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks interest expense includes the TABOR interest
expense of $35.9 million which is paid with the DTO service payment.
Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $21.4 million, the same amount as in the 2018
Amended Budget, all of which will occur in FasTracks Project for the North Metro debt.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2019.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $76.8 million on a combined basis, which is $12.1
million higher than the 2018 Amended Budget due to payment of principal on the 2015A COPs
beginning in 2019 and the inclusion of the TABOR principal payment of $9.4 million in 2019.
Of
the total, Base System principal payments are $62.6 million (increase of $3.6 million) and FasTracks
principal payments are $14.2 million (increase of $8.5 million). No new debt issuances are planned
in 2019 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to
fund major capital purchases and construction in 2019.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2018 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2019. The capital
carry-forward will be $719.4 million made up of $136.5 million on the Base System and $582.9
million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $90.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $120.1 million from the
2018 Amended Budget due to project completion in FasTracks and the completion of LRV purchases
on Base System. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $89.3 million to $39.6 million in
2019 due mainly to completion of purchases of LRVs, a reduction in North Metro mobilization and
system work, offset by purchases of Flatiron Flyer vehicles and work on the Longmont Station.
For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $30.8 million from the 2018 Amended
Budget to $50.3 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $12.1 million less on capital
support projects (only the Welton blank-out sign replacement project is programmed in 2019), $21.7
million less on rail transit (the final purchase of the 29 LRVs was funded in 2018), and $3.4 million
less on capital support equipment (the major project here is the Oracle upgrade). These decreases
will be offset by an increase of $3.9 million in facilities construction and maintenance (a variety of
needed projects throughout the District), and an increase of $3.4 million in fleet modernization and
expansion (on-going purchases of 30-ft and 40-ft transits, Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride cutaway
buses). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Mid-term Finanical Plan in
October 2018 and is the amount identified for minimum critical projects within SOGR priorities.

expenditures for 2018 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2017 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve changes include an increase in the Base System yearend unrestricted fund balance from the 2018 Amended Budget to $41.7 million. This projected fund
balance is in alignment with the Mid-term Financial Plan after incorporating all revenue and expense
adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected
due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2019 (this will become evident in the
2019 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to
increase by $3.0 million to $23.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected to remain at $0,
and the unrestricted operating reserve is projected to increase by $0.7 million to $15.4 million.
A $5.0 million contingency reserve is carried for the second year for the Base System. The purpose
of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through the fiscal year. The funds will
be used at the General Manager’s discretion to fund unbudgeted inflationary increases, respond to
emergencies, new regulations, and cover cost overruns within his Board delegated authority.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the reserve funds are maintained at 3 months of
operating expenses. Additionally, in FasTracks Project, the FasTracks management reserve was
reduced by payment in settlement of RRP North Metro project claims and is now budgeted at $0.9
million. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $84.9 million in
2019 from savings from construction under budget and internal account growth.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $21.4
million over the 2018 Amended Budget. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal
policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations)
per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2019 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2019 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base
System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve for the Base System. The
objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately
three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The
2019 budget reflects maintenance of the FISA at a level deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to
FasTracks operations and maintenance.
On a District-wide basis, the total of these fund balances (excluding the FISA) for 2019 is projected at
$129.9 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $39.8 million, 2) the capital replacement
fund of $16.4 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4 million, and 4) the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance of $58.2 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances
listed for 2019 is projected to total $80.5 million.

Attachments
As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2019 Recommended Budget and Fiscal Year
2019 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/non-operating sources,
debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital expenditures, and fund balances
of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached is the Program Capital Summary
including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget Changes Since Posted Budget summary
(Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary (Attachment B), and Capital Carry-Forward
Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 for the adoption of the 2019 Budget, Resolution No. ___,
Series of 2018 for the 2019 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 for the
appropriation of 2019 Previously Appropriated Capital.
2. Revise the 2019 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2019 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District will not
be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by December 31,
2018. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2018, State statute (29-1-108
(3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations
and maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4

Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

Subject:

2019 Access-a-Cab Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to provide a subsidy
for Access-a-Cab for calendar year 2019.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
In March 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-a-Ride
program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers may schedule same day trips with participating taxi companies. Current
participating companies are Metro/Yellow Transportation, zTrip, Green Taxi, and Union Taxi. All persons
using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use RTD paratransit service.
The service provided is not RTD-branded transit service but rather taxi trips subsidized by RTD. The
passenger pays the total cost of the trip, and RTD provides a subsidy. The current subsidy is $12.00 per
trip.
The Access-a-Cab program has proved to be very popular. It is also beneficial to RTD because RTD pays
a smaller subsidy per ride than trips taken on the RTD-operated Access-a-Ride service. Trips taken by
those passengers on the regular Access-a-Ride service costs RTD an average of $67.00 per trip, as
opposed to$12.00.
In 2018, Access-a-Cab provided approximately 137,662 cab trips at a total cost to RTD of $1,651,944.
While we do not know whether those same trips would have been taken on Access-a-Ride, if those same
trips had been taken on Access-a-Ride, the total cost to RTD would have been approximately,
$9,223,354.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The budget for 2019 is as follows: Metro/Yellow $1,800,000, zTrip, $75,000, Green Taxi $150,000,
and Union Taxi, $435,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab service is budgeted annually based on
ridership and anticipated demand and must be approved by the RTD Board of Directors on an annual
basis.
Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2019 recommended budget. Funds for Accessa-Cab service in future years will be requested as part of the budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to
provide a subsidy for Access-a-Cab for calendar year 2019.
2. Do not approve the recommended action for the Access-a-Cab program and attempt to absorb
the increase in ridership onto the Access-a-Ride program at an increased subsidy per boarding.
This alternative is not recommended as it has the potential of raising the cost of Access-a-Ride
services.

Cost Sharing Agreements
funding for 2019

-

Non-urbanized

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for non-urbanized services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County. These
Agreements are for calendar year 2019 and for amounts not to exceed $387,271.00 for Boulder
County, $380,813.00 for Adams County and $135,243.00 for Jefferson County.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU),
along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized (i.e.,
rural) areas. The section of the Act that addressed the provision of services in non-urbanized areas was
called Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEALU provisions were moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21)
and the specific provisions regarding 5311 funding changed. Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to
various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas
of the District and to provide local match money for federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311
(non-urbanized) services in the District. RTD has provided financial assistance for the provision of nonurbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial assistance for the provision
of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $387,271.00 in 2019. RTD shall also contribute funding
to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount
not to exceed $380,813.00 in 2019.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $135,243.00 in 2019.
Non-urbanized service performance will be assessed at the end of each year to determine if performance
expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreements is warranted.
Performance is evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will
not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it
into conformance. The provision of non-urbanized service in 2018 (thru August) resulted in monthly
performance that ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger

Packet Pg. 84

13.D

boarding ranging from approximately $.87 to approximately $4.61 (subsidy reflects only the RTD
contribution).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the non-urbanized services is included in the recommended 2019 RTD
budget and is subject to formal budget adoption. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for non-urbanized services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson
County.
These Agreements are for calendar year 2019 and for amounts not to exceed
$387,271.00 for Boulder County, $380,813.00 for Adams County and $135,243.00 for Jefferson
County.
2.
Do not approve the funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination
of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties
which would have a negative impact on the individuals that depend on this service.

Subject:

City of Englewood Trolley Cost Share

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
Englewood Trolley circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year
2019 and is for an amount not to exceed $433,738.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The service, named the “art shuttle,” was implemented in 2004 as
a free service. In September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, RTD took over funding of
the art shuttle because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood
continued the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood also covered all
marketing and related expenses. In 2018, the City of Englewood gave the art shuttle a new name and
look – The Englewood Trolley. The Englewood Trolley shuttle continues to be a free service that is
sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would
have been paid if the Englewood Trolley charged a RTD fare.
The Englewood Trolley currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service
on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. For 2019, RTD has agreed to extend the hours of operation from
6:30 AM to 8:00 PM for one year. This extension of hours is being implemented to accommodate
employees at Swedish Medical Center and Craig Hospital where shifts end at 7:30 PM. The Englewood
Trolley operates between the Englewood light rail station and Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital.
The Englewood Trolley operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15) to twenty (20) minute frequency.
Ridership has averaged 649.0 boardings per day or 26.3 passengers per hour thru 2018 3rd Quarter.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the Englewood Trolley
in an amount not to exceed $433,738 in 2019.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the Englewood Trolley will be
assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to
determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in
terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation,
RTD and the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into

13.E

conformance. The provision of the Englewood Trolley service through the 3rd Quarter in 2018 resulted
in 26.3 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per Englewood Trolley passenger trip of $1.91. The
City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the Englewood Trolley.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the Englewood Trolley is included in the recommended 2019 RTD budget and
is subject to formal budget adoption. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support
for the operation of the Englewood Trolley circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This

2.
Do not approve entering into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood. This course
of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the Englewood
Trolley circulator service which would have a negative impact on the residents, visitors and
businesses in the City of Englewood.

City of Boulder Hop Cost Share

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at
Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2019 and is for
an amount not to exceed $1,559,509.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday. RTD staff has been working with the City staff in a Hop redesign
planned originally for 2018. Part of the redesign has taken place with the remainder planned for 2019.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,559,509 in 2019.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will
confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through the 2nd Quarter of 2018 resulted in 22.4 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP
passenger trip of $1.93.

2. Do not approve entering into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder. This course of
action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP
circulator service which would have a negative impact on the residents, students and businesses in
the City of Boulder.

Bus Donation to Flat Rock Law Enforcement
Training Facility

Safety,

Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the donation of a 40 foot bus that has reached the end of its useful life, to the Flatrock Training
Center to provide a permanent asset for regional law enforcement and first responder training.
The recommended action proposed supports the following GM Goals:
Core Goal #5 Effective Communications and Community Outreach
DISCUSSION
RTD is required to conduct Emergency Preparedness Drills and Exercises throughout the year to ensure
local /regional first responders are familiar with and adequately trained to respond to emergencies on
RTD vehicles. This requirement is a part of the new Safety Management System Regulations 49 CFR
Part 674 and 673 and our goal to be better prepared for emergency response. RTD receives requests
throughout the year to provide a bus for such training and currently we must pull a bus to provide that
training.
The donation of this bus to the Flatrock facility will provide a permanent asset for all local and regional
first responder agencies to train to better respond to emergencies that involve RTD buses. The Flatrock
training facility is currently used by over 50 agencies (list attached) in the Denver Metro and surrounding
communities; and is open to all agencies. This donation will benefit RTD’s employees and customers by
having better trained first responders in the event of an emergency anywhere in the District.
The Procedure for Disposal of Vehicles in the Procurement Manual states buses will be sent to auction
when they reach the end of their useful life. There is also a procedure in the Procurement Manual that
allows for donations to charitable organizations:
1.4.7 Donation to Charitable Organizations. Under special circumstances, donation to charitable
organizations can be considered. If the items were purchased with Federal funds, FTA permission
must be obtained. If purchased with only RTD funds, Board of Directors’ approval will be
requested.
The bus that will be selected for donation was not purchased with Federal funds and therefore a
Board of Directors action can authorize this donation to the Flatrock Training facility.
FINANICAL IMPACT
RTD typically receives between $500 to $1500 for each bus at auction.

2. Do not approve the donation of the bus to Flatrock, sell it at auction, and continue to pull buses out of
service throughout the year to ensure adequate first responder training.

Adoption of the Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 7, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached Investment Policy which contains no recommended changes from last year.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2017. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. No changes are recommended this year.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
A copy of the policy is attached in the form adopted by the RTD Board in November 2017.
Recommendation
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the attached Investment Policy with no changes.
2. Adopt the attached Investment Policy with changes

Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Bill Van Meter to a term expiring 12/31/2019
and reappointing Sylvia Francis to a term expiring 12/31/2020 as trustees for the Salaried Employee
Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability, and Task Goal #2 –
Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts.
Sylvia Francis current term expires 12/31/2018.
Series 2010 for reappointment.

She meets the criteria from Resolution No. 2017,

Scott Reed a Trustee who is a Pension Plan participant has retired from RTD; thereby leaving a vacancy
for an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Benefit (Pension) plan to serve as the same trustee
on both of the Trusts be selected by the Board.
The application and screening process has now been completed, and Bill Van Meter is recommended for
appointment as a trustee to the Plans to carry out the remaining term of Scott Reed who has retired.

for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.

2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD financial support
and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $780,000.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Task Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of
Transit Services.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry between six (6) to twelve (12) riders, and
the vehicles are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render
regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools
eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, RTD and DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of
2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed
that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable
mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area.
Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus
routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and
increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the

Packet Pg. 115

14.J

advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
93 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI (Enterprise) took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the
vanpools carry an average of 5.5 riders per van and the fleet is at 77% capacity.
Vanpool performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations
have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreement is warranted. DRCOG vanpool
performance through September 2018 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat of
approximately $3.09.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the DRCOG vanpool program is included in the recommended 2019 budget
and is subject to formal budget adoption. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Provide RTD financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the
Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2019 and shall be in an amount not
to exceed $780,000.
2.
Do not approve the financial support and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program.
This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would eliminate this transportation option for
residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area
and could result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

Adoption of the 2019 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 7, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2019 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2019, there are
41 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the same number as in 2018.
No new performance measures are proposed.
Core Goal #1: Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they integrate with the Board’s 2019 priorities of enhance
safety and security, service and human capital balance, fiscal sustainability, future transportation
needs, and asset management/state of good repair.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2019 are
brought to the Board of Directors for approval at this time because the measures are used in
development of the 2019 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2018 to 2019 are listed below:


Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on-time performance
o A change is proposed to the Regional on-time service measure only from 92% to 88.0%.
Traffic congestion is having a major impact on Regional service on-time performance
(OTP). For example, from 2014-2017, travel time and variability for I-25 southbound
weekday a.m. peak traffic has grown by an average of 9% every year (variability is the
extra time that travelers must add to their average travel time when planning trips to
ensure on-time arrival).
Other factors having an impact include the I-70 corridor
construction, drivers buying their way into HOV lanes, ridership growth from elimination of
Express service, service increases, and regional population growth. Year-to-date through
8/31/18, all regional routes combined had 87% OTP and it is unlikely that this will improve
over the next year.



Goal 5.1 Improve ADA on-time performance
o It is proposed that this measure and its definition be changed for 2019. The goal in 2018
and prior of 96.0% reflected carrier on-time performance (OTP). Changes to our Access-aRide service contracts regarding criteria for issuing liquidated damages for late trips no

Packet Pg. 117

14.K

longer make it necessary to have a separate OTP definition for contractors. Passenger
OTP is now relevant and is defined as an operator arriving for pick-up within a 30-minute
scheduled window. Any vehicle arriving at the pick-up location beyond the scheduled
window is considered late. The ADA contracts state that OTP should meet the same OTP
standard as fixed route, which is 86%. Passenger OTP was 88.1% in Q2. The proposed
goal for 2019 is 86.0%, making it consistent with fixed route.


Goal 6.2 Increase in ridership
o It is recommended that the ridership increase for 2019 be established at 4.1% which is
based on the fare revenue model. The fare revenue model incorporates the fare rate
increase approved for 2019, and assumes first time full-year ridership for the G Line and
partial year ridership for SERE in 2019. Overall system ridership is projected to be flat for
Base System with ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. The measure includes all
passenger boardings not limited to revenue ridership. Ridership estimates for the Mall
Shuttle and Free MetroRide are included in the measure.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2019 be established at 14.2%. This
is the percentage increase in total fare revenue in the fare revenue model over the 2018
projection. The proposed percentage increase of 14.2% is higher than the fare rate
increase that will take effect in 2019 because the 2018 fare revenue projection is
expected to come in about $3.5 million under budget. The increase is also driven by fare
revenue increases from ridership growth (see 6.2 above). The fare revenue model
assumes full-year ridership for the G Line and partial year ridership for SERE.
o It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2019 be established at
13.6%.
This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2019
Recommended Budget over the 2018 projection.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2019 Performance Measures are being utilized in the development of the final 2019 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopts the attached 2019 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In
2019, there are 41 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the same
number as in 2018. No new performance measures are proposed.
2. Modify the recommended 2019 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2019 Proposed Performance Report and make required
adjustments, if necessary, to the 2019 Recommended Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2019 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2019 Proposed Performance Report. This is not the recommended action because
it results in no measures for ridership, fare revenue, and total operating revenue and does not aid
in the development of the 2019 Budget.
