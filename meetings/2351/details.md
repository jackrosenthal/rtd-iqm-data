#### 2. Approval of SumTotal Systems Contract Increase

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the SumTotal Systems, LLC (Contract Number 14D0002) to increase by $290,933.23 the contract amount not-to-exceed limit from $343,003.80 to a total contract amount of $633,937.03.

Motion:                Director Lubow made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 15, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, introduced Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology and George Hovey, Program Management Office Manager.  Heather Copp restated that the recommended action is for an increase in the contract amount and that the funding for this item is available in the existing budget.

Kim Heldman explained that TruTrack, the original union payroll time tracking system, is now known as SumTotal.  Because of its age of 10 years plus in operation, the system continues to present a number of challenges, including the lack of replacement parts.  Earlier this year the decision was made to use SumTotal as the replacement system.  Due to the nature of the complex formulas used in tracking RTD’s union employees; hours, it was discovered that the out-of-the-box system did not cover all of RTD’s unique payroll elements.  Staff stopped the project at that point and made sure the vendor had a clear understanding of RTD’s needs.  Staff is asking for a contract increase so the additional requirements can be incorporated into the system.

Director Hoy asked if the funding was already in the budget.  Kim Heldman replied in the affirmative.  Director Hoy requested clarification if this was an amendment to the contract or a new procurement process.  Kim Heldman noted that this was an addition to the existing contract.  She added that staff went for a sole source request in 2014 for a new system.

Director Lubow wondered if this recommended action would have been served better by a Request for Proposal (RFP) given the needed customizations.  Kim Heldman replied that an RFP would have been likely in hindsight.  Given the intricate nature of the formulas necessary to calculate RTD’s union payroll, staff estimates that SumTotal would have been chosen through the RFP process.

Director Solano asked how union employees currently enter their time.  Kim Heldman said that they punch in on a time clock.  Director Solano noted that this type of system is ancient.  Kim Heldman clarified that the new system would use time clocks as well; however these will be modernized and updated to today’s standards.  Director Solano wondered if union employees could use laptops or handheld devices to turn in their time sheets and measure their productivity throughout the day.  He thought that this would be beneficial when accounting for out of the ordinary circumstances such as snow, traffic, flat tires, among others.  Heather Copp explained that operators do not have RTD email accounts.  Two desktop computers are available at the garages for employee use.  Time clocks are available on the way to their vehicles thus allowing for proper time keeping. She added that the software in the back end does all the calculation needed for the routes, duration of shifts and any out of the ordinary circumstances.

Director Lasater explained that in a credit card facility, a Tier IV facility is the bottom of the rung.  He wondered if these classifications are similar to the classifications used by SumTotal since it is described in the Recommended Action report as “Exceeds Tier IV facility requirements.”  He wondered if that meant that this company was at the bottom of the rung for cloud facilities and backups.  He added that in his personal company he runs a Tier III/almost Tier II facility.

Director Lasater mentioned that he does not like sole sourcing.  An RFP process is critical for transparency.  He added that there are a myriad of payroll processing companies that could possibly be better and cheaper.  He pointed out that for these reasons he would be voting against this recommended action.

Director Deadwyler expressed her concern because she wants to make sure that this recommended action will be enough for the new software to last 10-15 years and another ask will not be necessary in two years.  She said that too many times the Board has approved recommended actions that end up not working as intended.  She wants to ensure that staff has done the proper research.  Kim Heldman explained that staff did a deep dive and has a solid understanding of what is needed for the union time tracking system.  She is convinced that the vendor also has a deep understanding of the needs and is on board to provide the needed service. Director Deadwyler asked for the life expectancy of the equipment being proposed.  Kim Heldman replied that she was not sure but could research and provide the Board with an answer.  She noted that the current system is 10 years old.  Heather Copp added that the current contract with SumTotal is 5 years.   She pointed out that the software will upgrade to a cloud based system.  Director Deadwyler agreed with Director Solano noting that a time clock system seems ancient.

Director Francone wondered how long the previous contract term was.  Kim Heldman did not have that information available but will provide the answer to the Directors.  Director Francone asked what the term of the new contract is and if it includes future maintenance expenses.  Kim Heldman replied that the term is 5 years and it does include future maintenance expenses.

Director Anderson noted that RTD has a unique situation when it comes to our bus and train operators.  She asked staff to confirm that the current system has worked well given RTD’s intricacies.  Kim Heldman said that Director Anderson was correct.  Director Anderson noted that the current system has been satisfactory and that staff has not received complaints from employees about missing payments; however the system does need an upgrade because it has been in use for 10 years.  Kim Heldman told Director Anderson that she was correct.

Director Solano expressed his concern that time clocks do not track productive and non-productive time.  He said that we needed a device that at the end of the year would be able to produce a graph tracking productive and non-productive times, i.e. flat tires, accidents, etc.  He also shared his concern about not being able to track contracted bus operators.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, said that First Transit and Transdev, the contractors RTD works with, are separate employers with their own payroll systems.  RTD pays the contractors based on revenue hour of services regardless of what the pay employees.  He noted that RTD employs a pay by exception system with union employees.  Street supervisors have the capacity to change the times in case of any anomaly.  Heather Copp noted that bus route information is one of the types of information programmed in the software’s back end.  Director Solano said that he would contact staff as he had other questions.

Chair Sisk noted that this item asks for another $300,000 in unexpected costs.  He agreed with Director Lasater about his dislike for sole source.  Chair Sisk said that he would be voting for this recommended action as RTD cannot afford to have our employees’ checks in jeopardy.

Director Archuleta asked what kind of operating system the new program will use.  George Hovey replied that it will be a hosted environment.  He added that he could provide Director Archuleta with more details regarding the cloud based system.

Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered if SumTotal has access to our employees’ personal information, like social security numbers.  Heather Copp replied that it is a tracking system that feeds into our system.  RTD does payroll for union employees and all their personal information is confidential.  Committee Vice Chair Menten noted that the Recommended Action Report, included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for September 8, 2015, included the following sentence, “SumTotal has an established security program that has had preliminary RTD review, further review is underway and this will be followed by regular monitoring of this hosting service.”  She said this statement made it seem like RTD had just started working with this company.  Committee Vice Chair Menten asked to meet with Director Lasater so she can learn more about the tiers he referred to.

Committee Vice Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

#### 3. Approval of InFax Contract Authorization

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to execute a five-year contract with Infax, Incorporated (Contract Number 15FH003) in the amount of $1,788,655.39.

Motion:               Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology, noted that Programmable Information Displays (PIDs) are used at Denver Union Station, Civic Center Station, Boulder Station, Boulder Junction at Depot Square and Denver International Airport as well as other locations throughout the District. With the FasTracks expansion and desire for additional functionality (i.e. software updates and real time information), staff released a Request for Proposals to extend, enhance and/or replace the in-kind system.

Director Lasater shared the concerns he has heard from his constituents regarding the difference between scheduled time and real time.  He wondered if this software would give constituents real time information on buses and trains.  Kim Heldman explained that for the present and the immediate future it will still be scheduled time.  She added that real time will be available for bus service later this year and in 2016 for rail.  Director Lasater asked what the causes are for the delay.  He is concerned with the transfers between the A Line and the R Line.  He added that other systems throughout the nation have this information readily available through smart phone apps.  He said that if RTD is a leader in the transit industry we should be able to provide this information.  Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, explained that in order to retrieve real time information on trains new infrastructure needs to be placed along the right of way.  This project is budgeted for 2016.  Director Lasater emphasized that the sooner this project is done the better.

Director Folska asked if the real time information will also be audible for those with low or no vision.  Kim Heldman replied not at this time.  Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, explained that the PIDs do have the capability to be audible when speakers are installed; however, this would need to be coordinated with the announcements from buses and/or trains since too much audible information has the potential to create confusion.  Director Folska wondered if the speakers for the PIDs are part of the budget.  Heather Copp said that currently they are not part of the budget.  Director Folska noted that she would like the speakers to be included in the budget.  Heather Copp pointed out that in order to do so a decision needs to be made regarding bus/train announcements at stations with PIDs.  Director Folska restated that the speakers need to be added to the budget as ADA considerations need to be present in all recommended actions.  Committee Vice Chair Menten asked Dave Genova to come back to the Board with more information on how to have PIDs with audible announcements.

Director Solano asked if the information on the PIDs will also be available in Spanish.  Heather Copp said that staff will come back to the Board with that answer.

Director Solano wondered if the real time information that will be available on the PIDs will also be available via smart phone applications.  Dave Genova noted that RTD will launch a smart phone application with real time information as soon as the information is available.  He pointed out that third parties will have access to the information if they would like to include it in their applications.

Director Francone wondered how much of the requested amount will be spent on the PIDs themselves.  Kim Heldman said that the funding will be spent primarily on equipment and installation.  Heather Copp noted that staff will provide the Directors with a breakdown.  Director Francone asked regarding the grant funding and the RTD match for this item.  Heather Copp replied that the Federal grant is paying for the majority of the cost with the RTD match at 20%.  She added that the recommended action is for contract approval.

Director Anderson shared her concern about confusing people with too many announcements.  She wants to make sure this is done right.  She said that she trusts staff to meet ADA compliance and that the priority is to have real time information for the riders.  She noted that she will be supporting this action as it works towards the completion of the overall system.

Director Deadwyler said that she has a hard time with these types of recommended actions which ask for funding approval in increments.  She thinks that the recommendation is incomplete as there are many questions that staff has no answers to.

Committee Vice Chair Menten wondered if the PIDs will be used for advertising.  George Hovey, Manager of Program Management, pointed out that previously it was considered as a possibility but determined not merited.  He added that the decision could be revisited at a later date.  Committee Vice Chair Menten pointed out that she would not want riders to miss transit information because of an advertisement on the display.

Committee Vice Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, said she was pleased to announce that there has been significant progress on the SMT project since the 2nd Quarter update.

Kim Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology noted that this project is a shared effort among many departments of RTD.  She highlighted the following accomplishments achieved since the 2nd Quarter update:

- Day Pass Printers – completed statement of work, executed contract, completed design review, printers ordered, brackets for installment being manufactured by bus operations.

- Merchant Agreements – finalized with RTD Legal and Finance, verbal agreement from King Soopers.

- Smart Card Hosting – completed statement of work, procurement in process.

- Stored Value Pilot program underway

- First Staff Pilot with RTD employees – over 50 RTD employees, minimal problems reported.

- Independent readiness assessment to be conducted by IBI Group.

Kim Heldman pointed the Directors to the SMT Systems Budget and Expenditures table as included in the SMT and Day Pass Printer Status Update in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for September 8, 2015.  She mentioned that the chart includes the budget breakdown for the Xerox contract.  She then highlighted the project elements with a yellow status, which means they have a current or anticipated issue with minor variance in scope, possible increase in budget or possible delay.  These items are:

- External Hosting of SMT Environment – procurement cycle timeline and complexity of the architectural design took additional time to finalize.

- Stored Value Internal Portal/Back-Office Enhancements – due to the timing, availability and competition for Xerox development resources.

- Handheld Smart Media Readers (HSMR) – Xerox needs to make programming changes to accommodate the new devices.

- Cybersecurity – RTD is dependent on Xerox to perform remediation before RTD can complete all the changes needed.

Director Folska thought that the Board had already approved funding for the HSMR.  Heather Copp explained that the Board had approved it in the Strategic Budget Plan.  The HSMR will be included in the 2016 Budget which will be discussed during the September 29, 2015 Study Session.  Kim Heldman added that the new HSMR will likely be iPhones with an attachment that will accommodate the necessary software for 2016.

Director Lubow wondered if the only merchant willing to sell Smart Cards was King Soopers.  Kim Heldman replied that the plan was to reach out to other retailers.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that Safeway is reorganizing with Albertson’s so at this time they are not interested but indicated they might be interested in the future.  He said that staff has reached out to Walgreens.  Committee Vice Chair Menten asked if Walmart is a possibility.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, noted that Walmart respectfully declined as they are not able to implement local initiatives that are not available corporate-wide.

Chair Sisk thanked staff for their great work.  He said he was sorry to see some downgrades; however, he noted that listing these spoke to the integrity of the process.  He suggested that staff give an SMT update during the November Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting since the next update is scheduled for December and the program is scheduled to go live in January, 2016.  Heather Copp replied that staff will place a quick update in the October and November Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting packets and allow a time for any questions.  Committee Vice Chair Menten agreed that more frequent updates would be a good idea since the SMT is close to kick off.

#### 2. State Audit Process Update - No Backup

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that Colorado State statute requires the State to audit RTD at least once every 5 years and more frequently if requested by the State Audit Committee.  The current year is the 5th year of the cycle.  He noted that RTD received communication from the State late last year that the audit was coming up.  Chair Sisk and then General Manager Phil Washington sent a Letter of Understanding to the State in late February/early March of this year.

Scott Reed noted that State statutes call for confidentiality until the audit is released to audit committee.  Because the auditor selection went through a Request for Proposal process, the focus of the audit can be made public.  This audit will focus on matters related to compliance with bus and light rail train operator safety requirements.  He said that the State pointed out that this audit is different from the one 5 years ago as that one directly focused on the former General Manager Cal Marsella’s contract and concerns expressed over severance package and deferred payments.  The past audit made specific recommendations to the Board.  The current audit will make recommendations before management.

Scott Reed added that the Audit Committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday, October 20th at 9:00 a.m. at the State Capitol Building in room 271 to review RTD’s audit.  He read the following statement from the State of Colorado to the Board, “Please inform the Board that RTD has been good to work with and responsive to the auditor’s requests for information.  We understand that the audits could be difficult at times and we appreciate the cooperation and efforts to make this a smooth audit and a value-added process.  We are in discussions with RTD at this point as our team works to write its findings and draft the report.”

Director Bagley recalled that RTD had to pay for the last audit.  He asked staff the price for the current audit.  Scott Reed replied that the total cost of the audit is $137,750 plus a 5% State Auditor Office fee.  RTD was billed $93,567.50 on June 30th and the remainder will be due once the audit is completed.

Committee Vice Chair Menten asked staff to confirm that there is a 5% surcharge to the State Auditor’s Office.  Scott Reed confirmed that she was correct.

Director Francone asked if the subject of the audit is confidential.  Scott Reed replied that the scope of the audit is public yet the specifics are confidential.  The process usually casts a wider net than they are looking into.  Director Francone wondered if it was confidential because the work was in process.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that State statutes call for confidentiality for all audits.

Director Francone noted that the audit seemed to be a performance audit.  She wondered if staff felt that the scope of the audit is appropriate.  Scott Reed replied that the scope as written felt appropriate.

#### 3. Second Quarter 2015 Performance Measures

Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, referred the Directors to the Second Quarter 2015 Performance Measure updates as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda Packet for September 8, 2015.  She noted that the only measures that did not achieve goals were:

- Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance

- Goal 4.2 – Level of Customers Complaints

- Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership

- Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization.

She added that RTD continues to exceed its vacancies goals in bus operator and bus mechanics due to retirements, system growth, and strong local economy.  She noted that Human Resources is trying out a “one-stop” recruitment process by providing applicants with drug screening and background checks at one time to shorten the cycle.

Director Lubow shared that during General Manager Executive Search Employee Listening Forums employees expressed their frustration at the length of the hiring process.  She pointed out that low income people do not have months to wait on a job offer.  She wondered if staff has asked employees for their feedback on this matter.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, replied that as part of the Strategic Plan staff is in the process of conducting market research with employees.  He reinforced Heather Copp’s remark regarding the economy; people are returning home to higher paying jobs or returning to old jobs.  Director Lubow noted that this implied that RTD cannot keep up.  Bruce Abel added that as the economy improves RTD remains static.

Committee Vice Chair Menten recalled that there were a substantial amount of comments from operators during the General Manager Executive Search Employee Listening Forums referencing how hard it is to deal with shifts, i.e. split shifts, end times, and others.  She said that these comments may be an insight as to the high turnover rate.

##### a. 2015 performance measures-Second Quarter

#### 4. 2016 Requested Budget (High Level Update)

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis reviewed the 2016 Requested Budget Presentation as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for September 8, 2015.  The presentation included RTD’s Vision and Mission, the 2016 Budget Theme, the Strategic Budget Plan Summary, 2016 Budget Assumptions, 2016 Budget Targets, Sources and Uses, and Next Steps.

Director Folska asked for clarification regarding the fund balances.  She thought that in the past the goal was 3 months of operating expenses yet the presentation mentioned 2 months.  Jannette Scarpino explained that for base operations the fund balance is 3 months, approximately $90 million.  For FasTracks, it was adjusted to 2 months of operating expenses in order to contribute to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  Director Folska wondered what the FasTracks fund balance would look like as RTD moves from capital programs to operations and maintenance.  Jannette Scarpino replied that the goals will remain the same and as staff starts sketching out the budget they will present those to the Board and adjust as necessary.

Director Francone wondered what items were accounted for in the non-departmental line item.  Jannette Scarpino replied that this line item is a catch all for items that do not fit in other categories, such as interest expenses and intern programs, among others.

##### a. 2016 requested budget 090815

#### 5. July 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller, reviewed the July 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report update as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee agenda packet for September 8, 2015.  He also distributed updated charts with the final Sales & Use Tax numbers as they were received after the agenda packet was distributed.  Overall, the Sales & Use Tax, Ridership, and Fare Revenue were lower when compared to the July 2014 numbers; however, when comparing 2015 year to date to 2014 year to date Sales & Use Tax and Fare Revenue have increased.  Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, noted that if the downward trends remain, management will meet with each area to discuss what can be delayed, postponed or eliminated in order to achieve budget targets.

Director Bagley thanked Doug MacLeod and Heather Copp for such a comprehensive yet top level update.  He said that it helps the Directors understand where RTD is at.  He noted he would not be surprised if Fare Revenue and Ridership continue to decrease given that the predictions are valuing retail gas at $2.00 per gallon by the end of the year.  He added that the Denver gas market is one of the highest in the nation.  He thinks that Sales & Use Tax may keep increasing.  Committee Vice Chair Menten thanked Director Bagley for requesting the extra information now included in the Monthly Financial Status Report.

Director Lubow said she was very thankful to have this information summarized in the report.  She noted that things are very volatile and wondered if the decrease in ridership is correlated to gas costs.  Doug MacLeod replied that gas costs seem to be one of the factors for ridership, though it is hard to pin down the exact reasons.  Director Lubow noted that gas prices may help us in our forecasts.

Director Lubow asked if staff knew why the Sales & Use Tax was decreasing.  Heather Copp clarified that Sales & Use Tax is not decreasing but rather the rate of growth is slowing.  She expects to see more information in the Leeds Forecast from the University of Colorado.

Director Lubow inquired regarding the state of the FISA account.  Heather Copp said the initial projections made may have been too optimistic.  Staff is examining the original assumptions and will bring an update to the October Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.
