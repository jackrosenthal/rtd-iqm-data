&

Board Meeting Date: September 15, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2014. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor in reviewing the
current Policy. No changes are recommended this year other than updating some staff titles to reflect
the current organization chart.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
A final version of the recommended policy is attached
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15 (2505 : Approval of Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

1.B.1.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 8

Attachment: Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15 (2505 : Approval of Investment Policy)

3.3 Yield

1.B.1.a

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Investment Policy FINAL 8-28-15 (2505 : Approval of Investment Policy)

1.B.1.a

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

1.B.1.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend
the SumTotal Systems, LLC (Contract Number 14D0002) to increase by $290,933.23 the contract
amount not-to-exceed limit from $343,003.80 to a total contract amount of $633,937.03.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current union payroll time tracking (Hardware and Software) system, TruTrack, is over ten-years
old and has passed its end-of-life. The TruTrack brand is now known as SumTotal. Because of its age
and operations, this system has presented a range of continued challenges to RTD:
 The current system is unstable, difficult to support and has had multiple outages, at times
occurring daily.
 Replacement hardware does not exist to continue to repair the onsite (RTD) hosted system.
 Replacement time clocks are no longer available.
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, a manual time tracking and payroll generation effort
spanning multiple work groups would be required.
Early in 2014 it was determined, in consultation with the Business Unit, that replacement of the existing
TruTrack system was absolutely necessary to assure the future ability to meet union payroll. There was
significant concern that the TruTrack system would not survive the length of time required for the
normal open procurement process. RTD’s union payroll structure is extremely complex and the existing
TruTrack system was configured to address all of these unique practices. In addition, there was a due
diligence review of available alternative technical solutions, concluding the cloud base SumTotal product
was the logical replacement system. With that, a sole sourced contract was advanced with SumTotal
(May 2014) to replace TruTrack with SumTotal’s new Workforce Management (WFM) hosted time
tracking system. The sole source was approved and the original bid was within the General Manager’s
contract authority. The project kicked-off July 30, 2014 with SumTotal project team arriving at RTD.
RTD’s union payroll system will be hosted at SumTotal’s datacenter. General information on this
service:
 Located in Columbus, Ohio
 Exceeds Tier IV facility requirements
 SSAE 16 certified operations; DOD and HIPAA certified and ISO 27001:2005 certified facility
 Internet connections to multiple Tier-1 ISP backbones
 Servers monitored every 5 minutes



Redundant high-capacity power supplies. UPS systems and standby diesel generators capable
of supporting the site indefinitely.
SumTotal hosts over 1,600 customers operating globally

SumTotal has an established security program that has had preliminary RTD review, further review is
underway and this will be followed by regular monitoring of this hosting service.
DISCUSSION
Late last year as the functional requirements were in development, it became apparent the “out-of-thebox” SumTotal system would not fully address the unique union payroll needs. In the spring of this
year, the project was stopped by RTD, pending confirmation that all needed functionality was fully
identified and documented, understood by the vendor and the initial and life-cycle costs to implement
were known. This extremely detailed effort included the staff from payroll, materials management, and
IT technical and business analyst staff. From this analysis, twenty-one unique customizations were
identified as necessary to provide for each element of the union agreement. To make these
customizations SumTotal submitted a requested contract modification for the additional funds. The
authority increase also addresses future maintenance expenses. If approved, the modifications will be
done during the fall, testing will be conducted late this year into early next year and with normal end-ofyear activities the go-live will be April of 2016.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The additional cost will be met by existing capital and operational budgets. These expenditures are not
a diversion from other efforts or assignments.
ALTERNATIVES
Three alternatives were considered:


Continue with Existing Contract and Accept the Completion Proposal
The current staff assigned by SumTotal has aggressively worked with RTD to understand and
document the complete set of requirements and needed outcomes. They provided a proposal to
bring closure to this deployment. In that the system is hosted in the cloud, RTD and SumTotal
will have a long-term relationship.
SumTotal will be responsible for maintaining the system and minimizing downtime of the system;
responsible for implementing a failover plan; with the hosted system RTD should realize
operational cost savings over the life of the system. SumTotal now understands the full breath
and complexity of RTD’s union payroll structure.



Terminate Contract and Pursue an Open Procurement for a Replacement System
This alternative would terminate the SumTotal contract. In all likelihood this would require
eighteen-months to two-years to procure, develop, and deploy a fully functional replacement
system. During this time, the RTD hosted TruTrack system will need to remain operational. This
could also be followed by legal action to recover some portion of expense from the unsuccessful
attempt at deploying the SumTotal system. e.g. return of time clocks.

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.2

During the procurement and implementation of the new system the legacy system must continue
in operations. Staff has considerable reservations that the system could remain viable for 18
additional months. It is possible that an open procurement in addition to taking nearly two-years
may cost more than the cumulative cost with this contract increase. In addition, we would lose
the sunk cost of $343,000.


Terminate Contract and Revert to TruTrack System
This is not a sustainable option as this existing system will fail, it is a matter of when. This
option is not viable.

Board Meeting Date: September 15, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to execute a
five-year contract with Infax, Incorporated (Contract Number 15FH003) in the amount of
$1,788,655.39.
BACKGROUND
RTD uses Programmable Information Displays (PIDs) including monitors and LED signs, to disseminate
information to its riders on travel status. RTD’s current system uses monitors at a number of venues
including Denver Union Station, Civic Center Station, Boulder Station, Boulder Junction at Depot Square
and the Denver International Airport (DIA). There are also LED signs throughout the region.
These displays provide scheduled departure information for RTD fixed route service and light rail. With
the advancement of Real-Time Traveler information, in the future these data will be extended into the
PIDs system.
The current system was deployed over six-years ago, functions well and has been reliable. With the
Fastrack expansion, desire for additional functionality (e.g. real-time information) and the importance of
this rider service, a procurement was released to extend, enhance and/or replace in-kind the system.
DISCUSSION
RTD released procurement Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 15FH003, it was issued May 20, 2015 to
provide for expansion of RTD’s Programmable Information Display System (PIDs). The contract has a
6% DBE participation requirement. A well-attended vendor briefing was held June 2. The proposal
period closed June 26 and two proposals were received.
One of the vendors did not comply with the Buy America contract requirement, nor appropriately
advanced associated waiver provisions and was disqualified. Staff conducted a careful and through
review of the proposal of the remaining vendor, Infax, Incorporated. Infax is the incumbent PIDs
provider. The panel specifically considered:
 System functionality and use
 Proposed Work Program
 History of firm conducting similar assignments
 Qualifications of key staff
 DBE participation
 Price

Packet Pg. 22

1.B.3

The review panel met with Infax representatives. The panel unanimously recommended selection of the
Infax base of the following findings:
 Infax had a considerable background of similar systems in transit, air transport and judicial facilities.
 The proposed staff was well versed in the system and had prior working experience with RTD.
 The proposed system was an enhancement of RTD’s current system and was a cost effective move
to address future needs.
 The proposed system and services addressed all RFP requirements.
 Infax had a proven record working with the proposed DBE firm Servitech, Inc. at RTD and other
locations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract is structured with a series of options that support current operations and future needs.
While the overall contract authority is for $1,788,655.39, the first set of executed options will address:
support and/or provisioning of new or additional signage at DUS, full implementation at Boulder Junction
at Depot Square, Oak Street Station, and US 36. The option also includes system licensing and an
extended warranty. This first option is primarily funded by a federal grant that does include a local
match and operating funds will address future warranty expense. The total cost of the first set of
options is $681,510.99.
Subsequent options address Fastracks, integration of real-time information, and possible replacement of
current light rail platform signage. Executing these options will be made based on future needs and will
be funded through the operating and SBP budgets. Further option executions are exclusively at the
discretion of RTD and there is no guarantee of additional assignments.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Execute the Infax agreement. Infax has a proven record in this space, is financially
competitive and meets the agency needs. Executing the Infax agreement is staff’s
recommendation.
 Extend the current system using RTD staff. Current staff levels are inadequate to address the
anticipated demands. Further the content system contains proprietary software that cannot
be modified directly by RTD.

Board Meeting Date: September 8, 2015

DISCUSSION
Stored Value is a product that can be purchased by the general public to pay for transit fares on fixed
route buses and rail platforms. Stored Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips.
These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is
loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare
needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card.
We are targeting January 1, 2016 for the Stored Value public pilot go-live which will include:
 Stored Value available for purchase at RTD sales outlets
 Changes to the web portal that focus on Customer Care functionality
 Changes to the SMT System to accommodate the new fare structure
 Day Pass Printers installed and functioning on RTD fixed route buses
There are a considerable number of related efforts underway for the January 1 public pilot launch of
Stored Value involving several departments within RTD including:

Second Quarter 2015 Performance Measures

&

Board Meeting Date: September 8, 2015

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2015. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance
measures tracked, RTD met 19 of the goals in their entirety in the second quarter vs. 19 in the first
quarter. Improvement occurred in most measures over the first quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q2; however, performance is
improving over 2014 and Q1-2015 in all categories. In Local on-time service, all carriers show
continued improvement and only RTD Local and First Transit-Commerce City did not meet goal.
Regional & Express on-time service also showed steady improvement, although the goal was not
met. The work that staff has done in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the
resources needed to improve, such as service changes and further operator training, is yielding
results. These staff targeted efforts will continue.
Light Rail on-time service also improved over Q1 and exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
There was virtually no change to this measurement in Q2 from Q1. Overall system complaints met
goal, but individually, three carriers did not. We have seen customer complaints increase across
the entire system over the past 2-3 years due to several factors including the fare enforcement
campaign, the stroller policy, and heavy/longer load times, TIC availability, SmartCards, and the
addition of West Line. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of
these complaints and to work with operators to address the valid issues.
In Q2, RTD and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal while First Transit-Commerce City, Transdev
and First Transit-Denver did not meet goal. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the
Operations/Customer Services report.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership in Q2-2015 is only slightly below goal by less than 1%. Ridership goal is a 0% increase
for 2015. Ridership actuals compared to budget will continue to be evaluated.

Packet Pg. 32

1.C.3

Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus operators and bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high
level of vacancies in this category and recruitment is on-going. Human Resources revised its hiring
practices to include “one-stop” recruitment and the use of outside agencies in order to shorten the
hiring cycle. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth, and the strong local economy.

(3) December 2014 was high due to the year-end accrual of expenses which were paid in 2015
(4) Increase due to drawing funds from the TIFIA loan - TIFIA loan of $280m has been fully drawn.
(5) Increase is due to funds being set aside for semi-annual debt service payments
(6) Variance is due to a timing difference between construction expenditures and bond and COP draws. Bond and COP draws will replenish this by year-end.
(7) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 amended budget
