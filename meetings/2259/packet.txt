Access-a-Ride/Cab 4th Quarter Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 2% through the 4th quarter of 2014 compared to the same period
of 2013. Productivity decreased from 1.24 to 1.22 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 4%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride
passengers allows RTD to accommodate increased total program ridership while limiting the need to
increase resources devoted to Access-a-Ride. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
increased by 2% compared to 2013. Total boardings increased from 872,980 total boardings thru Q4
of 2013 to 891,430 total boardings thru Q4 of 2014.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 3% during the 4th quarter of 2014 as
compared to the same period of 2013. Access-a-Ride is approximately 4% under budgeted revenue
hours through the fourth quarter of 2014.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 4th quarter of 2014 was 94.9% and decreased slightly as
compared to the same period in 2013. Our private contractors continue to address on-time performance
challenges. Several of the carriers are utilizing the radio and billboards as a means of attracting potential
operators.
Passenger on-time performance through the 4th quarter of 2014 was 83.9% and remained similar to the
same period in 2013 (83.7%).
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger increased slightly through the 4th quarter of 2014 as compared to the same
period in 2013 as complaints increased from .0009 complaints per passenger boarding to .0011
complaints per passenger boarding. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve
overall customer satisfaction.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Belmar CnR - This service was introduced in April 2013 with the opening of the West Corridor. One
of the 2 vehicles operated on a flex route during the peak hours and replaced parts of the Rtes 14
and 17 that had been discontinued or modified with the opening of the West Line. The flex route did
not pick up bus ridership as expected and was discontinued in August 2014, but the vehicle was
retained to serve on-request trips and Oak Station with timed meets. If ridership does not increase
by the August 2015 runboard, one bus will be recommended to be discontinued.
Evergreen CnR – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school closed whose students rode CnR and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. We are planning a Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) to be formed this spring.
CnR is the only RTD local service in the community.
Federal Heights – This was started in January 2012 with a CMAQ grant with the local share funded
by Federal Heights (no RTD funds). RTD recommended discontinuance of the CnR in January 2015;

however, the community and RTD agreed to keep the CnR for 1 year at a 50% cost share to each
party. In 2014 an advocate started teaching seniors how to use the CnR. This has worked and
ridership began rising in 2014. RTD will form a TAC to address Adams County CnRs in summer
2015.
Highlands Ranch - This opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands Ranch
CnR replaced the poorly performing Rte 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried numerous
adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued twice.
Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users. While the subsidy is
high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to Access-a-Ride where
the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially to the CnR in the
past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership.
Parker – This opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has made
adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker will cost share with the RTD for 50% of the
subsidy. A TAC was formed to reevaluate service and marketing to increase ridership.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2014

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2014 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Transdev (formerly known as
Veolia Transportation) continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident
investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. Three of the four passenger accidents that occurred in the 4th
quarter were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise
awareness of passenger safety to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors as a group did not meet the target of 88% Local On-Time Service in the 4th
quarter. Transdev met this goal with 88.3% Local On-Time Service. First Transit Denver and
Longmont nearly met this goal with 87.1% and 87.9% Local On-Time Service. RTD and the
private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time performance
with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the
OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are
impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely

Packet Pg. 27

1.C.4

manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.


OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors as a group met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding in the 4th quarter.
First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Longmont met the goal with .0004 and .0003
complaints per boarding in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address
customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance to retrain
operators on the importance of good customer service and automatic vehicle location software to
improve on time performance. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.

4th Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2014. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2013.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2014 is .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
For the 4th Quarter of 2014, RTD, First Transit Commerce City, and First Transit Longmont met the goal
of .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. First Transit Denver and Veolia had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0004 complaints
per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004
complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2014, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 4th Quarter 2014, the complaints in this category decreased 25.7% compared
to the same period in 2013. In many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category for 2014 is 4.8 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 6.4 complaints
per day.
Bus Early – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 22.6% compared to the same
period in 2013. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 31

1.C.5

YTD average in this category for 2014 is 5.1 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013
was 6.6 complaints per day.
Bus Late – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 3.4 % compared to the same
period in 2013. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons
including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same
number of passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address runningtime issues. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 12.4 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 12.0 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 8.9% compared
to the same period in 2013. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses and RTD is in the process of installing a system on its buses. These
incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as
needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe
driving habits. The YTD average in this category is 4.6 complaints per day. The comparable number for
2013 was 4.2 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 2.0% compared to
the same period in 2013. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 11.0 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2013 was 10.8 complaints per day.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 34.1% compared to the same period in 2013.
Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD
average in this category for 2014 is 0.3 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 0.5
complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 11.3% compared to the
same period in 2013. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting
fares to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that
passengers presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of
the fare policies. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 1.1 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 1.3 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 9.2%
compared to the same period in 2013. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 32

1.C.5

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is
8.0 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 7.3 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 11.3% compared
to the same period in 2013. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with
up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average
in the category for 2014 is 0.4 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was also 0.5
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 4th Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 8.1%
compared to the same period in 2013. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (156 of the total 3,999 = 3.9%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 11.0 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 10.1 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

4th Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of October, November, and December.
These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police
officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare
evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace
officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This
quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
