### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Fare Study Update

Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reminded the Board that public hearings were scheduled to start next week.  She reviewed a Power Point presentation that is available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Lacy Bell recapped the staff recommendation of passengers paying per boarding with a 2x day pass.  This recommendation would also eliminate rail zones and have fares based on the type of service (local/rail, express, regional, and airport).  She said that the fare levels included in the recommendation meet the Strategic Budget Plan revenue targets necessary to maintain planned service levels.

Lacy Bell outlined that there would be one public hearing in each District, with an additional hearing at the Blake offices.  Spanish translation will be provided at all hearings.  She said these were advertised on-board RTD vehicles, in print news media and online, both in English and Spanish.  Lacy Bell noted that there are other opportunities for comment.  There is a phone line, online comment form and survey that people may use who cannot attend one of the public hearings.  These options were also advertised on-board RTD vehicles.

Lacy Bell stated that the next steps are:

- Final Staff Recommendation for Board Approval

o        Target: April 14 Operations and Customer Service Committee

- Title VI Equity Analysis

o        Equity analysis is underway for the current staff recommendation

o        Summary of the results will be presented to FTA and the Board

- Begin Phase 3: Pass Program Evaluation

o        Determine opportunities for improvement of non-profit agency low income program

o        Develop action plan for pricing Eco and College Pass on smart card utilization data

She noted that this is an aggressive timeline with the Title VI Equity Analysis and Phase 3 beginning simultaneously with the public hearings.

Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing, explained that in the current Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program:

- RTD works with over 200 non-profit agencies to offer free and reduced fares to low income individuals including the working poor

- Agencies are responsible for verifying individual income eligibility and distributing fare media

- RTD provides 10-Ride Ticketbooks or monthly passes to non-profits for a discount (25%-60%)

- Maximum amount participating individuals pay is 50%

- $5.8 million in fare media provided in 2014

o        RTD subsidized $2.5 million

Tony McCaulay pointed out that there are opportunities for improvement in the program.  He said that the fare study goals for the Non-Profit Agency Program are to improve access, simplifying the program and streamline the administrative processes.  Staff plans to continue outreach within the non-profit community to have recommendations by July, 2015, for implementation in early 2016.

General Manager Washington stated that staff has received a great deal of input up to this point and we are still in the comment period.  He reiterated that staff has made a recommendation but it is not the final recommendation that will be brought to the Board for approval.

Director Menten suggested putting information about the fare study on the functioning kiosks throughout the District for additional outreach.  She asked if staff could provide her with how many people benefitted from the $5.8 million in reduced fare.  Tony McCaulay said that staff would provide the Board with the number of ticketbooks and passes that were purchased by agencies but did not track the specific number of people.

Director Folska asked Tony McCaulay to explain the various discounts offered.  Tony McCaulay stated that there are three aspects of the program.  Agencies can purchase 10-ride ticketbooks for a 60% discount or monthly local passes at a 40% discount.  For both of these options the agency must provide the tickets or passes at no cost to their clients.  The third program is available on all monthly passes.  Those are purchased at a 25% discount and the agency can recover up to 50% of the cost of the passes from their clients.  He said that staff is finding from the survey results that not many agencies are recouping any cost from the clients.

Committee Chair Anderson requested staff prepare a one sheet outline of the program to be distributed to the Board.  Tony McCaulay said that he would provide it as soon as it was finished.

Director Walker inquired if staff had been in contact with King County Transit as they have implemented a low income fare program.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, said that staff had not been in director contact but had been following the program, specifically the financial impacts.  General Manager Washington shared that he spoke with the King County CEO in Washington, D.C. about the program.  There have been significant costs to the agency and they have had 4 or 5 fare increases since 2008 for all other riders.  General Manager Washington stated that there is definitely a cost to an agency in having a low income fare program.  He said that staff would be looking to get additional documented information from King County.  Committee Chair Anderson noted that they have also cut service during that time.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their hard work during such an intense process.  She asked if staff could provide the final classification list of Express and Regional bus routes.  She feels it would be helpful to have this information when speaking with her constituents.  Lacy Bell stated that she would send the Board the information.

Director Lubow shared that she sent an opinion article written by former Boulder County Sheriff George Epp from the Boulder Daily Camera to several staff members.  In the article it discusses how RTD local bus fares have gone up about 60% since 2006 while the consumer price index rose only about 16%.  She wonders if those numbers are accurate and if so, could staff provide an explanation for why our increase is so much higher.   General Manager Washington said that staff would send the Board the information.

Director Deadwyler shared that in speaking with non-profits, she learned that while RTD may serve 200 agencies, there are over 1,600 in the state.  She wonders if we are willing to work with new non-profits and if so, how much might it cost RTD.  Scott Reed explained that the program is open to all qualifying agencies.  He said the cost is unknown as it depends on how many agencies participate as well as any changes that may result from the surveys and discussions with non-profits.

Director Archuleta requested a list of the participating agencies.  Tony McCauley said he would send it to the Board.

Director Tobiassen said that he has heard frequently from the non-profits about the need for an improved low income program.  He asked if staff envisioned the income requirements in the new version remaining the same.  He said he has also heard concern about undocumented immigrants.  He wonders how that might fit into our program.  Tony McCaulay stated that income guidelines could be reviewed but when 50% of your ridership already qualifies he is not sure how much those can really change.  Tony McCaulay said that he did not really have an answer for the undocumented immigrants as RTD does not require documentation of citizenship to get fare media; it would be up to each agency in terms of how they qualified individuals.

Director Folska shared that at the recent APTA Legislative conference she had lunch with the CEO of the Savannah Transit System.   She explained that the have a very innovative way of having very low fares, though she does not know all the details.  She suggested that staff look into this program.

Chair Sisk said that he too had been presented with the statistics referenced by Director Lubow.  He thinks that fare increases need to be discussed logically so he is interested to get staff’s analysis of the past increases.

General Manager Washington recognized Lacy Bell for her great work on this project.  He said she is really one of the agency’s superstars.

Director Hoy thanked the Board and staff for their continued support of the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride.  He noted that ridership was down in December, but it also appeared to be down for most Call-n-Rides.  He wondered if that was a normal trend for December or something else.  Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, said that Brain Matthews, Senior Manager of Special Services, was unable to attend due to an illness but she would have him follow-up with Director Hoy.

Director Francone thanked the Special Service team for their work.  She shared that she was visiting the senior resource center in Evergreen.  She said they are very interested in moving forward with a transportation advisory committee, which she hopes to be part of as well.  Director Francone passed along a comment from her husband that the South Jeffco Call-n-Ride has been working very well as a result of restructuring to better meet light rail schedules.  She said he really appreciates the service.

Director Hoy commented that something he is always concerned about is fare checks.  He shared that several weeks ago he got on a train at Denver Union Station for the Pepsi Center and his fare was checked.

Committee Chair Anderson said that when they were visiting a Congressional Representatives office during the APTA Legislative Conference one of the aides told them he received a warning during a fare check.

Director Walker stated that at Denver Union Station the other day security was checking fares before passengers got on the trains.  He noted that they were very courteous and helpful.  Director Walker thought they were doing a very good job.

#### 7. Light Rail Safety Update

Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Facilities, and Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the March 17, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Dave Genova explained that the rail regulatory environment is much different from that of operating buses.  While all accidents involving RTD vehicles or property are investigated, for any accident involving rail or on rail transit-controlled property, RTD must submit a report to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for approval.  He stated that these reports are highly scrutinized.

Dave Genova informed the Board that every month there is an Executive Safety and Security Committee (ESSC) that meets to review every accident and conduct trend analysis.  The goal of this analysis is to find anything that RTD can do to work toward prevention of those accidents.  He stated that minutes are transcribed and sent to the General Manager and Federal Railroad Administration.  Dave Genova said that several years ago the Committee noticed that 99% of the rail accidents happened Downtown in the street running environment and most of these accidents were between automobiles and trails.  He explained that based upon this analysis RTD put in some active flashing light train indicators.  As a result there was a dip in these accidents.  He noted this is just one example of staff’s efforts to reduce and prevent accidents.

Dave Genova explained that there is a difference between a reportable accident and a preventable accident.  An accident that is non-preventable can still be reportable per the PUC requirements; additionally, just because the driver of the automobile is cited does not mean it is non-preventable.

Dave Genova pointed out that there were 51 accidents in 2014, which is high, but only one accident was preventable.  He said on the surface the ESSC has not identified any trends that can be targeted but will continue to review.  He commented that between 2012 and 2014, 95% of all accidents had damage of less than $1,000 and 90% had no injuries.  He said this illustrates that a most of the accidents that occurred are minor.

Dave Genova noted that there have been two fatalities each year from 2012 to 2014.  In 2014 both fatalities were ruled suicides.  He said in 2012 and 2013 the fatalities were also non-preventable.

Terry Emmons outlined the rail operator training program.  It is an extensive 5 week program that combines classroom and hands on training with a Training Supervisor.  He said that his team is very excited to get the simulator as it will really enhance the training program.  Terry Emmons noted that in addition to operator’s initial training there are ongoing refresher classes, mandatory continuing education, and annual certification ride checks.

Director Bagley stated that the rail operator training is extremely important.  He asked staff to speak to the status of the commuter rail operator training program.  General Manager Washington said that Denver Transit Partners’ ramp up is underway.  He suggested bringing their General Manager and staff to a meeting over the summer to brief the Board on their program.

Director Menten inquired how our suicide statistics compare to other agencies.  Dave Genova said that RTD has had very few suicide events.  He stated that there are other transit agencies that have a huge problem with suicides, some even going to far as to engage in suicide prevention activities.

Director Menten wondered what sort of collision our cross arms could withstand at an at-grade crossing.  She asked if someone was sliding on ice would the arms really provide any resistance as they look pretty flimsy.  Terry Emmons explained that the gates are designed to be spring loaded; if there is an impact to the gates they open so as to not get damaged.  He said it would take a pretty good force to activate the springs but if someone was sliding they could continue to slide through the crossing.

Director Folska asked when staff anticipated delivery of the simulator.  Terry Emmons shared that two staff members will be traveling next week to do the factory acceptance testing.  Once the testing is complete it should arrive in May and be operational mid-June.

Director Folska said that when she was attending the APTA Legislative Conference there was a lot of discussion about removing the space between train cars for safety.  She wonders if this is something staff is familiar with.  She suggested staff look into some of the literature written around inattentive blindness.  She thought this might be useful, especially when doing outreach and education.  Dave Genova stated that discussion about the space between cars has been going on for years; however, implementation really varies depending on the system.
