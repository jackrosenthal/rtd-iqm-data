BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2023 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal Criteria and
Weighting

Committee Meeting Date:
November 16, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
December 6, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the performance appraisal criteria for the performance period
commencing January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2023, and for each performance period
thereafter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and Debra A. Johnson entered into an employment agreement, dated September 29, 2020,
which provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by which the
Board will annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. The deadline for the Board to adopt the
performance evaluation program was originally March 9, 2021.
On July 20, 2021, the Board approved a Third Amendment to the employment agreement establishing
the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation program for Ms. Johnson related to the
Board-adopted Strategic Plan values, Strategic Priorities, success outcomes, and metrics.
The Board formally adopted the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan on August 10, 2021, and in doing so
established the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and
Financial Success as well as the associated Success Outcomes.
Surveys were conducted in Q3 2021 to establish a baseline to measure the Strategic Priorities of
Community Value and Customer Excellence. An additional survey was conducted in May 2022 to
establish a baseline for the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership.
Subsequent surveys measuring Community Value and Customer Excellence were conducted in
September 2022 The next occurring up Employee Ownership survey will be conducted in Q2 2023.
On October 25, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the employment agreement
stating that, for the annual performance period commencing January 1, 2022, the Success Outcomes
include only Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success, with equal weight being
given to each for a total of 50% of the appraisal score.
DISCUSSION
For the performance period commencing January 1, 2023, and for each subsequent performance period
thereafter, the annual performance appraisal score will be comprised of 50% objective Success
Outcomes associated with their respective Strategic Priorities, with equal weight being given to each,

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

and 50% subjective Organizational Values, as adopted by the Board pursuant to the Strategic Plan,
including any amendments thereto.
If the Board does not provide an evaluation to Ms. Johnson by December 31 of the performance period
beginning in 2023 or any performance period thereafter, Ms. Johnson will be deemed to have met all
performance expectations for that performance period.
This recommended action aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the GM/CEO’s performance is reflective of the overall
performance of the agency as a whole.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action. Any performance
incentive for the 2022 performance period would be contemplated in a separate recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
GM/CEO Employment Agreement and Compensation
Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
November 16, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (“Agreement”). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022. The Third Amendment to the Agreement
provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and
benchmarking analysis that will be used by the Board in consultation with GM/CEO Johnson to
determine her compensation for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023.
DISCUSSION
Following a competitive solicitation, Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. was selected to conduct a
comprehensive and systematic benchmarking analysis of the total compensation package for the
GM/CEO, including both external market-based factors and internal equity considerations, to ensure
competitiveness in pay practices. This analysis is intended to inform the Board in its decisions on
compensation for the GM/CEO role relative to market considerations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this discussion item.
