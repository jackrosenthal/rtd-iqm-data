## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Tobiassen noted there were six retirees this month, three or whom were present.  He said that while we are always happy for our retirees, we do hate to see them go as they have much institutional knowledge.  He would like to congratulate them on their years of service and a job well done.

Interim General Manager Genova indicated that there were two retirees from Bus Operations and one from Rail Operations in attendance.  He asked Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, to begin the recognitions.

Bruce Abel asked Steve Gieske, General Superintendent of Maintenance, to join him in recognizing Lonnie Barlow, a General Repair Mechanic with 22 years of service.  Bruce Abel shared that Lonnie has been married for 40 years with six children.  He said Lonnie plans to get good use of his camper trailer visiting the Midwest.

Steve Gieske stated that Lonnie worked out of the Platte division as one of RTD’s dedicated Mall mechanics.  He said that by and far Lonnie was a leader who took care of those vehicles as if they were his own.  He does not believe RTD would have gotten the same level of performance out of the Mall vehicles over the years if it had not been for Lonnie’s dedication.

Lonnie Barlow said his 22 years have been good years and RTD has been good to him.  He is happy to hear that RTD thinks he has been good for the company as well.

Bruce Abel commented that in the old days he would ask Mike Gil, former Deputy AGM of Bus Operations, to join him, and in the new days he would ask Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy AGM of Bus Operations, to join him but neither were able to attend this evening.  He acknowledged Kerry Ross, a Bus Operator from the Platte division with 24 years of service.  He shared that Kerry has a new dog named Billy as well as two children and several grandchildren.  In retirement Kerry plans to do more fishing, skiing, hiking and geological searching, travel to Europe, and learn to play the piano.  Bruce Abel thanked Kerry for his years of service to the District.

Kerry Ross thanked the Board and everyone at RTD.  He said it has been a wonderful time.  He loves dealing with the public and made many friends.  It was always a very satisfying job.  He wanted to especially thank everyone at RTD for the pension plan.  He stated that it makes everything more secure for him in retirement.  He thinks it is a great plan and benefit and he is sincerely grateful for the plan.  Kerry Ross also believes the deferred compensation plan that was started in the late nineties is a wonderful addition to the pension plan.

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, asked Greg Pennington, General Superintendent of Rail Infrastructure, to join him in recognizing Darren Callahan, a Track Maintainer with 30 years of service.

Greg Pennington shared that Darren worked on the bus side in the service and cleaning area for about half of his career and moved over to light rail in 2000.  He said that Darren was very much someone you went to when you needed to get a job done.  Greg Pennington noted that Darren was one of the people involved with the development of RTD’s track maintenance program.  He stated that Darren would be missed.

Darren Callahan thanked the Board and RTD, and especially Terry Emmons and Greg Pennington as they were great to work for.

Chair Tobiassen recognized Beth Cooke, Fare Inspector with 29 years of service, Leonard Ford, Body Mechanic with 18 years of service, and Anthony Quintana, Bus Operator with 25 years of service, who were not able to attend the meeting.  He thanked them for their outstanding service to RTD.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Tobiassen indicated that the public participation section of the Board Meeting was open to anyone who would like to address the Board.  He reminded everyone that each speaker would have three minutes.

- Susan Dolph, DRMAC, stated that overall she gives RTD an A+ for outstanding service; however, she is concerned about the proposed changes to the 16th Street Mall Shuttle.  Oh behalf of those with mobility and other types of disabilities she is asking the Board to give serious consideration to leaving the 16th Street Mall Shuttle as is.  She thinks it would be very problematic for people with disabilities to need to go to 15th or 17th Streets to catch the shuttle.  She also wondered what RTD planned to do with the X, Y and Z stops if the Shuttle was moved.

- JM Fay from Arapahoe County had Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public Information, read her statement on her behalf as she is unable to speak.  JM Fay wanted the Board to know that there are a lot of problems with RTD but due to the three minute time constraint she would just provide the highlights.  She outlined the following issues:

o        Too many buses are not showing up, especially the Route 73 in her community.

o        Buses are late or deliberately do not wait for passengers to make connections and transfers only last for three hours.  This is a problem when someone misses their connection.

o        Route 73, 11, 38 and 76, among others, are set-up in a manner where one bus is always 10 minutes after the others so passengers miss it.

o        Her area can only access the light rail through Route 21, which only runs once per hour on weekends, which is a problem.

o        Fares were raised by 20% but only the 10-ride ticket books are discounted at King Soopers; passengers should be able to use two discounted tickets to purchase a day pass or be able to purchase discounted 5-ride day pass ticket books since Smart Cards are not available to everyone.

o        With elimination of Route 86X the buses are now overcrowded and passengers have to cross over an icy overpass.

o        The Trip Planner is not working and it is difficult to deal with Customer Care.

She expressed that the buck stops with the Board.  The community does not want to hear that RTD is short drivers due to screwy schedules which are causing drivers to quit.  People need to get to their destinations.  She said this will come out as many of the Board members are up for reelection and people are unhappy.

- Sharon Quigley, Boulder, indicated that she was here this evening to represent the countless FF4 commuters who were unable to attend.  She said that she was going to address the Board; however, she has learned from staff that there might be proposed changes so she would just submit the riders’ comments and petition she gathered.

Chair Tobiassen asked Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, to explain the proposed FF4 changes as he through this might address many of the public’s comments.

Bruce Abel explained that one of the major changes that took place with implementation of the Flatiron Flyer was the way passengers at Broomfield and Westminster could access Civic Center.  Previously these passengers would ride the BF or 86X to Union Station and then use the Metro Ride or 16th Street Mall Shuttle to get to Civic Center.  He said staff attempted to provide a single seat service from Broomfield and Westminster to Civic Center through the FF4.  He stated that the demand for this service has been unexpectedly high.  As a result, staff hopes to eliminate the Westminster stop along the FF4, which would address the overcrowding that occurs and allow the buses to utilize the infrastructure improvements along US 36.  A short-turn service between Westminster and Civic Center would also be added during peak periods.  He stated that staff is attempting to find resources and vehicles in the near-term but it would definitely occur by April with the approval of those service changes.

- Bill Silberstein, Boulder, shared that he has been riding RTD for 35 years.  He is here this evening to address the FF4 complaints.  He appreciates the quick response in making changes; however, it is not a complete solution for former HX riders.  Stopping in Broomfield still adds to the travel time.  He said that to him Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) means getting back and forth quicker.  Even with staff’s amended plan his trip is now a slower trip.  He hopes RTD will continue to be open to changes to this service.

- Nick Clabbers, Boulder, has been riding RTD for 4 years.  He said he recently graduated from law school and accepted a full time position near Civic Center.  Part of his reason for deciding to remain living in Boulder was because of his public transportation options.  He said the change from Route HX to the FF4 was pretty disappointing.  He appreciates the efforts to improve the issues.  He is in agreement that continuing to stop in Broomfield is not a full solution but he is willing to give the service another shot.  He thinks this will be much less intrusive than also having to stop in Westminster.

- John Desmond, Executive Vice President of the Downtown Denver Partnership, noted that the Board had received a letter of support of the 16th Street Mall Shuttle service changes to accommodate the Meet in the Street events.  He said he wanted to stress what a positive relationship the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) has had with RTD and the City and County of Denver (City).  He stated that it is so important that the overall Downtown Denver experience is positive for everyone.  The DDP believes the Meet in the Street events as proposed will help enhance people’s experiences as they come Downtown.  He indicated that DDP plans to continue to work with RTD and the City to make sure the Meet in the Street events are a win-win for everyone involved.

- Dawnalyn Edgar, Denver, said she was here to protest the practice of dropping a bus route if RTD does not have a driver for that route.  She considers RTD’s schedule to be a contract with the riders.  She shared that two days in a row she had a bus that did not show up which is inexcusable.  She stated that she did not know what needed to be done but it was unprofessional for RTD to drop service.

- Brad Buchanan, Executive Director for Community Planning and Development for the City and County of Denver, pointed out that the 16th Street Mall Shuttle proposal for the Meet in the Street events has been in discussion for over a year.  He noted that there were questions about why the City and DDP were asking for having the Mall Shuttle moved for more days than last summer.  He explained that last summer helped the City work with its consultant to define the questions for and goals of the events in the upcoming summer.  He noted that there was also a concern from RTD about funding.  He shared that the City and DDP have been working with RTD to determine the cost for RTD to create equivalent service on 15th and 17th Streets, which will be $27K.  The City and DDP have agreed to pay for that service.  He said at the end of the events they plan to debrief the experience and analyze the data.  He asked the Board for their support of the Meet in the Street events.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, said conceptually he has no problem with the idea of trying to get people Downtown by the City and DDP.  He thinks Downtown could use some excitement.  He shared that his problem is a personal one as moving the Mall Shuttle means he has to walk an additional two blocks.  He feels this will be an issue for other people as well.  He expressed that the Meet in the Street concept is good but the mechanics have not yet been worked out very well.

- Yolanda Begay, Denver, reminded the Board that she spoke at a Board Meeting several months ago.  She recognized that many of the Directors were upset and felt threatened by what she and others had to say about poverty but she feels many of the Directors do not understand.  She stated that many RTD riders work minimum wage jobs.  The community has been asking for a date when RTD will implement an affordable fare but they have not been given one.  She is very disappointed with many of the Directors and is starting to get fed up with RTD.  She said she is getting sick of having to come to the Board Meetings every month to try and reason with the Directors to understand where she is coming from.  She extended an invitation for the Board to attend an upcoming 9 to 5 event.

- Candace Johnson said she works for an organization called Jobs with Justice, which is a coalition of labor, community, faith and youth organizations that come together to advance workers’ rights and social justice.  She noted that for a while her organization has been hearing from its members that RTD’s fare increase is beyond what they can pay.  She stated that as a responsible advocate she was going to continue to urge the Board to consider an income based pass.  She expressed that as elected officials, many in the community look to the Board to make transit a public good.  As it currently stands she feels RTD falls short of being a public good.  RTD falls short of ensuring people have access to affordable transportation.  She noted that many organizations have vowed to work with RTD but she feels that every time they address the Board, their comments are rebuffed and pushed to the side.  She stated that the transit reliant are RTD’s most reliable customers and they deserve to have the Board’s support.  The decisions of the RTD Board have a major impact on people’s lives.

- Daniela Villarreal said she is a community organizer with the Colorado People’s Alliance, one of the members of the Affordable Fares Task Force.  She urged the Board to support the community by approving an income based pass.  She asked the Board to make this a priority and allocate money within the budget.  She feels there are several items that the Board will be voting on this evening where the funds could instead be used for an income based pass that would impact a significant number of riders.  She applauded RTD for the improvement of the Non-Profit Program but indicated that resources are still limited.  She asked the Board to give their commitment by putting a timeline in place for when an income based pass could be implemented.

- Dre Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, was at the meeting to share the experiences of a member who was unable to attend.  This member does not have a car and is completely depending on RTD.  If she buys a day pass for $5.20 it will end up costing her over $100 by the end of the month.  This member feels frustrated that she is paying $5.20 for a day pass when the buses do not run all day.  Dre shared that recently this member wanted to attend church but realized she did not have enough money for bus fare for her and her daughter.

Dre Chriboga-Flor acknowledged that the Board has an upcoming retreat.  She hopes an income based pass is something that is discussed.  She shared she recently attended an Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting and was disappointed that affordable fares were not brought up once.  She asked the Board to put their heads together and give the community a timeline.

Chair Tobiassen thanked the public participants for their remarks.

- Attended Operation Give-a-Gift at the Colorado State Veteran’s Home on Tuesday, December 22

- Attended the 2016 Leadership Academy Kickoff on Thursday, January 7

- Attended the 16th Street Mall Partners Meeting on Tuesday, January 19

Questions from the Board:

- Director Bagley asked Interim General Manager Genova to provide the Board with the names of the Leadership Academy participants.  Interim General Manager Genova said he would also provide the names of the Max Program participants.

- Director James said he was glad to see the real-time information available to developers.  He wondered when our customers would be able to use it.  Interim General Manager Genova explained that there is already one application available to our customers, Transit App, that is using the real-time information for our local routes.

- Director Walker noted that, similar to some of the speakers, he too knows how it feels when your bus does not show up.  He indicated that this happened to him recently and he had to wait half an hour for the next bus.  He said that when the next bus did arrive there were problems with the fare collection system.  He wondered how widespread these types of problems were and the prognosis for fixing them.  Interim General Manager Genova stated that there was an issue with some of the pass validators that affected around 200 buses.  He believes this issue has been addressed.  There was also an issue with some of the day pass printers and the paper jamming.  He said that staff had a solution to the issue and were working to implement it.

Interim General Manager Genova stated that as it relates to dropped routes, staff will begin presenting information on this to the Board monthly along with information on the hiring of operators and maintainers.  He said there is no excuse for a dropped route but unfortunately it is a labor issue.  He expressed that staff is working very hard to increase hiring.

- Director Folska inquired when additional automated announcement information related to transfers would be available on the buses and trains.  Bruce Abel explained that the capability is available but it is still in the development process.  He stated that staff is working to determine the standard for the exact information that is announced.  Director Folska indicated she would like to talk about this more offline.

- Director Folska feels that with regards to hiring there needs to be better communication and the process needs to be more streamlined.  Interim General Manager Genova shared that in addition to applying online or via paper applications, RTD is also offering a “one-stop-shop” where people can come in to fill out the application, go through the interview and do the prescreening tests in one location.  He said this allows staff to hire on the spot.  He noted that these have been happening at Blake Street and District Shops but staff was hoping to expand them as well.  Director Folska asked that the Board be emailed the dates of those events.

- Director Lubow reiterated that the no show buses are a problem, but the idea of people not being notified is an even bigger issue.  She hopes staff will really look at this as it is a time sensitive issue.  Interim General Manager Genova indicated that staff is having conversations about the best mechanisms to get this information out to the customers.  Director Lubow wondered if this was something he thought could be addressed in several weeks.  Interim General Manager Genova said he was not sure there would be any advancements on this issue within a few weeks.

- Director Lubow noted that there is a requirement for bus operators to have had a driver’s license for two years.  She wondered if this length of time was really necessary.  She shared that she works with the refugee community where there is interest in becoming bus drivers but they have not had a license for that long.  Interim General Manager Genova said he would look into the requirement but typically RTD follows the federal regulations.

- Director Solano said he sees a severe problem when our riders are waiting in the cold and there is no avenue for them to find out if their bus has been dropped.  He thinks this is outlandish.  He thanked Director Lubow for her comments about a way to notify passengers.

- Director Archuleta asked how much drivers are paid when they start as this could be part of the problem.  Interim General Manager Genova stated that drivers start at $15.67 per hour but he believes wages will be looked at during the next contract negotiations with the Union.

## XII. Unanimous Consent

Chair Tobiassen reminded the Directors that there is always the option to move items from the unanimous consent agenda.  He asked for a motion to approve items A through D.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve the unanimous consent agenda.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Vote on the

Motion:              The motion passed with 14 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 0 opposed.  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### A. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 40 - 40' Transit Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $17,677,000 for the purchase of 40 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare components.

### B. Contract Award for the Purchase of Up to 241 Cutaway Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to award a contract to Master’s Transportation for the purchase of up to 241 Goshen cutaway buses for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $14,580,000.

### C. 5311 Cost Share Agreements

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County.  These Agreements are for calendar year 2016 and for amounts not to exceed $364,933.00 for Boulder County, $358,849.00 for Adams County and $111,187.00 for Jefferson County.

### D. Service Increase for Transdev On Demand

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the Transdev On Demand ADA paratransit services contract #13-DH-035 to increase the level of Access-a-Ride services per month at a reduced per-trip cost ($36.50 for contract year 2 and $37.23 for contract year 3) to be effective 2/1/16 through 12/31/16.  This represents an increase of $460,000 in the overall contract costs.  This action also approves the transfer of funds necessary to fund this increase in contract cost.

### E. April 2016 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the April 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $290,966, and a net annualized cost of approximately $65,000 after grant funding; further, the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Prior to asking for a motion to approve the April 2016 Service Changes, Chair Tobiassen asked if there was unanimous consent for the division of the recommended April 2016 Service Changes as currently constituted to remove the staff recommendation regarding the 16th Street Mall Shuttle service detours for the Meet in the Street events, and to treat this particular recommendation as a separate, free-standing recommendation from staff to be acted on independently by the Board.  In asking for a show of hands there was not unanimous consent to divide the two items.  Chair Tobiassen asked if someone would make a motion for this division.

Motion for

Division of

a Question:              Director Folska made the motion for the division of the recommended April 2016 Service Changes as currently constituted to remove the staff recommendation regarding the 16th Street Mall Shuttle service detours for the Meet in the Street events to treat this particular recommendation as a separate, free-standing recommendation from staff to be acted on independently by the Board.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Vote on the

Motion for

Division of a

Question:              The motion passed with 10 in favor (Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano) and 4 opposed (Archuleta, Bagley, Tobiassen, Walker).  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion for the division of a question to treat the 16th Street Mall Shuttle service detours for the Meet in the Street events as a separate, free-standing recommendation PASSED.

Main Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve the amended April 2016 Service Changes with the removal of the 16th Street Mall Shuttle detours.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Primary Motion

to Amend:              Director Sisk made the motion to amend the April 2016 Service Changes to address issues relating to the newly introduced Flatiron Flyer service as follows:

“Under this amendment, the Flatiron Flyer 4 would be removed from US 36 & Sheridan Station (Westminster), relieving the passenger demand issues currently experienced during the busiest times in the peak period.  This change will also allow the FF4 service to utilize the HOV lane for a longer period of time, with entry and exit of the HOV at US 36 & Broomfield Station rather than US 36 & Sheridan Station.

This proposal also creates a new service, proposed to operate between US 36 & Sheridan Station and Civic Center Station.  Temporarily designated the Flatiron Flyer 86, this new pattern would begin in the morning peak at US 36 & Sheridan Station in Westminster, as did the former Route 86X.  The FF86 is proposed to provide four peak period trips, both morning and evening, utilizing articulated coaches and operating between US 36 & Sheridan Station and Civic Center Station.

The estimated cost of this proposal is projected to be approximately $215,000 annualized.”

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Tobiassen pointed out that this is the amendment outlined by Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, during public participation.

Director Hoy stated that he wants to assure that his constituents are not standing at the Westminster station watching the FF4 go by and not having enough service themselves.  He asked Service Planning and Scheduling to monitor the FF86 closely.  Bruce Abel noted that the FF86 will provide more capacity than currently exists but indicated that staff would continue to monitor both the FF4 and FF86.

Director Lubow asked for confirmation that the new service from US 36 & Sheridan would be both in the morning and evening peak periods.  Bruce Abel stated that was correct.  Director Lubow expressed that these changes sound wonderful.  She urged staff to continue to monitor the FF4 and FF86 as well.  She hopes staff will be willing to make additional changes if it is determined they are needed.

Director Francone asked for clarification as to what Bruce Abel meant earlier by short-term service to US 36 & Sheridan Station.  Bruce Abel apologized for the confusion.  He explained that it is actually a short-turn route that only operates between the US 36 & Sheridan Station and Civic Center Station.

Director Sisk thanked staff for being nimble in terms of responding to our constituents.  He said that as we continue to open new lines we will need to monitor the new service and make modifications accordingly.  He appreciates everyone who provided their input throughout this process.

Vote on the

Primary Motion

to Amend:              The amendment passed with 14 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 0 opposed.  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the amendment PASSED unanimously.

Secondary

Amendment:              Director Sisk made the motion to amend the primary amendment to the April 2016 Service Changes to remove the proposal to increase service on Route 324 due to the deferral of the anticipated grant funding from DRCOG.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lubow commented that the increase in service for Route 324 would really benefit the people in the city of Longmont.  She said they are looking forward to the change but understand it cannot happen until RTD gets the funding from DRCOG.  She urged staff to be vigilant and that staff be ready to move when DRCOG is ready with funding.

Chair Tobiassen noted that DRCOG is still planning on funding the increase in service but unfortunately the timing was not right.

Vote on the

Secondary

Amendment:              The amendment passed with 14 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 0 opposed.  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the amendment PASSED unanimously.

Vote on the

Main Motion as

Amended with the

Primary and

Secondary

Amendments:              The April 2016 Service Changes, as amended, passed with 13 in favor (Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen, Walker) and 1 opposed (Menten).  Director Anderson was absent.

Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED.

Chair Tobiassen asked for a motion to accept the staff recommendation to detour the 16th Street Mall Shuttle from the 16th Street Mall to operate along 15th and 17th Streets for 10 days on five (5) consecutive weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) starting Saturday, June 25, and running through Sunday, July 23, contingent on the City and County of Denver (City) contributing $27,000 to help defray the cost of maintaining existing 16th Street Mall Shuttle frequency on half (5) of those days.

Motion:              Director James made the motion to approve the detour of the 16th Street Mall Shuttle as recommended by staff.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Francone thought that Mr. Buchanan from the City and County of Denver said that the City was willing to pick up the full cost of maintaining the 16th Street Mall Shuttle frequency; however, the recommendation read by Chair Tobiassen indicated the City would only cover the cost for half of the days.  Bruce Abel explained that staff is hoping to learn if it is really necessary to maintain the frequencies.  As a test, the service frequency will be maintained for only half of the days, which the City will cover the full cost of.  Interim General Manager Genova noted that the City and Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) would be paying the $27,000.  Director Francone thanked the City and DDP for recognizing RTD’s expense and working with staff on this matter.

Director Lubow pointed out that there was another issue around the estimate that RTD might lose up to $150K in FTA funding if ridership was reduced.  She noted that this is a very fluid figure that RTD will not know until after we have moved the 16th Street Mall Shuttle to 15th and 17th Streets.  She inquired if staff had discussed getting that money from the City.  Bruce Abel stated that ridership is one of the factors that is used in the formula for FTA funding.  He said that staff’s hope and expectation is that ridership loses will be offset by promoting the rest of the system for people to use to come and participate in the Meet in the Street events.  He noted that there have been conversations with the City and DDP but there is no concrete resolution to those conversations.  It is the collective desire of all parties to increase ridership systemically.

Director Lubow wondered what would happen if RTD did lose FTA funding.  Bruce Abel stated that was a possibility.  He explained that the maximum loss to RTD as calculated by the Planning Department was between $115-$150K if there were no ridership gains elsewhere in the system.  Interim General Manager Genova indicated that staff wanted to make sure the Board was aware that the potential to lose funding exists; however, he noted that there are several things different than the previous year, such as a different configuration and Meet in the Street events happening the same time as other events downtown, so staff believes these losses will be minimized.

Director Lubow reiterated that there is still the issue of RTD losing money and asking the City to help.  Interim General Manager Genova stated that it was a concerned that was shared with the City.

Director Deadwyler expressed that she had similar concerns as those of Director Lubow.

Director Bagley believes this is a work in progress.  He thinks that the Directors need to accept the fact that there is the potential for some FTA funding loss, but this will not be the last time the City and DDP are going to have a request for the Meet in the Street events.  He said if there is a loss this year then that will provide a basis for an ask in future years.  He feels that staff is working with our partners to not just address this but things like safety, urban camping, etc.

Director Folska pointed out that for over the last year she has heard people come to the Board and ask for an income based fare for people that cannot afford to use the system.  She said that during that time the Board has approved spending money here and there.  Many votes are for a smallish amount of money but it adds up.  Her concern is that the Board just keeps spending money without addressing the most important problem of keeping fares affordable.  Director Folska said that she would support the recommendation but wants to see our partners compensate us for any funding shortfall.  She stated if that does not happen she will not be in support of any further studies.

Director Walker wondered if there was any data on the impacts of other events like the Colfax Marathon where our service is diverted for some period of time.  He stated that he does not see any harm in diverting the 16th Street Mall Shuttle for these five weekends as we need to have real world evidence on the impact of these types of detours.  He noted that if the Meet in the Street events are successful it will not be in the City’s benefit to short RTD.  He believes they will find a way to make RTD whole.  He thinks the Board owes it to the District to try new things.  It is a small cost for this experiment that could have large benefits for the entire District.

Director James agrees with Director Walker’s characterization of this as an experiment.  He appreciates the opportunity to partner with the City and DDP.  He pointed out that in comparison to some of our other service changes this is a small dollar amount.  He believes this is a worthwhile experiment.  Director James shared that in his day job he has found that activities like the Meet in the Street events can help in eliminating some of the less desirable activities on the Mall.

Bruce Abel stated that the sentiments expressed by Directors Walker and James are very reflective of staff’s sentiments.  He said the recommendation of 5 weekends allows RTD, the City and DDP to collectively look at our mutual objectives while evaluating any issues.  He shared that there will also be events before and after Meet in the Streets to evaluate what happens when the Mall Shuttles are running on the Mall.

Director Sisk thinks this is an opportunity to partner with the City and DDP.  He sees this as being a positive experience while recognizing that there are risks.  He believes this is a way to continue our relationship building, which is what makes this region so strong.

Director Hoy appreciates the City and DDP’s spirit of cooperation in contributing $27K to RTD.  He feels this shows that they are invested in this partnership.  He believes the outcome of this year will help to determine how this is approached next year.  He thinks at this point it is best to see what happens this year and adjust in the future if needed.

Director Bagley asked for a summary of the total economic impact of this action, in addition to the April 2016 Service Changes, as there were so many amendments.  He thinks that trying to have a nexus between this action and something like a low income pass just is not correct as these are different items.

Director Francone encouraged the City and DDP to consider what they have heard from several Directors about their concern of losing federal money.  She said she was excited to experiment with them to bring more vitality to the Mall.  She hopes that the City and DDP would consider an active marketing campaign throughout the entire District to encourage people to attend and use RTD.

Chair Tobiassen thanked everyone for the lively and spirited conversation.  He said he looks forward to working with the City and DDP.  He appreciates the partnership that RTD has had with them over the years.  It is fun to come Downtown on RTD to enjoy these types of events.
