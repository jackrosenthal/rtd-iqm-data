B. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates noted that the Metro Mayors Caucus
Retreat will be on January 9, 2016. He said that there are several
transportation and transit matters to be discussed. He added that Move
Colorado and the Colorado Contract Association conducted a poll regarding
solutions for transportation funding; however, the poll did not address transit
specifically.
Roger Sherman thanked the Directors who participated in the Citizens
Advisory Committee roundtable on December 9. The committee has 5
retiring members who expressed their appreciation for the RTD Board of
Directors support.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs
Jenifer Brandenberry from Brandeberry~McKenna noted that the State
Legislative Session starts on January 13th. The discussion will be dominated
by the State budget. She pointed out that Colorado is economically strong
yet there will be a tug of war due to the budgeting process. She expects
transportation to be part of the conversation.
She highlighted the legislation that the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) will introduce regarding bus on shoulder operations.
Jenifer Brandeberry mentioned that the bill has bipartisan support in both
chambers and will be fast tracked through the process. She noted that
there will be a more robust update during the February Government
Relations Committee meeting.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Brandeberry~McKenna for their great
work.

Director Francone asked for details regarding the January 28th Legislative
Forum at Denver Union Station. Megan Wagner from
Brandeberry~McKenna noted that the event is on the Legislature social
calendar from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Director Francone asked for a copy of
the invitation in order to follow up with her representatives. Committee
Chair Folska asked Megan Wagner to send the invitation to the all the
Directors so they each could follow up with their representatives.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs reported that before the winter break
Congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill to fund the agencies
and programs of the Federal government through September 30, 2016. The
omnibus bill funds surface transportation programs at the increased spending
levels outlined in the FAST Act, the 5 year authorization bill enacted in early
December. This bill was passed alongside a $680 billion package of
permanent and short-term extensions of tax breaks. He noted that this
meant $150 million for the Eagle P3 Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA)
and $92 million for the Southeast Rail Extension FFGA.
Mike Dino said that with the passing of the multi-year authorization bill and
the full-year appropriations bill the attention will then move to the US
Department of Transportation (US DOT) implementations of the FAST Act.
This includes converting the Surface Transportation Program to a block grant
to give it more flexibility.
Mike Dino shared that there was a small victory in the language for Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT). He said that Small Starts BRTs could run 5 days a
week instead of 7. The other changes that RTD was hoping for did not
come through. He pointed out that his team would keep working on their
end to push for the language change.
He mentioned that RTD submitted a budget request for $167 million for
Fiscal Year 2017 since the Eagle P3 project was not fully funded.
Director Lubow wondered how RTD could continue to work with committee
members on the BRT definition if the authorization is for 5 years. Mike Dino
replied that there are annual reauthorizations and RTD could take advantage
of this process to see updates. He added that this would be part of the

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of Contract for Investment Advisor Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a one year contract plus four one year
optional extensions to Public Trust Advisors (PTA) to perform RTD’s
investment advisor services. The new contract would begin March 1, 2016
with a cost of up to $175,000 for the first year depending on the assets
under management during the year. The cost of the optional years is also
dependent on the assets under management at that time. The cost for all
four option years is anticipated to be approximately $800,000, if executed.
Total cost for five years is anticipated to be $975,000.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 19, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, asked Brenden
Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments, to review
what RTD’s investment services cover and the process
followed to select a firm.
Brenden Morgan noted that RTD has utilized the services of
Public Finance Management (PFM) for the past five years.

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone was absent.

PFM provided advice in regards to investment of RTD’s
operating funds and bond proceeds. He explained that typical
investments include US Treasuries, Corporate Bonds,
Municipal Bonds, etc. as outlined by RTD’s Investment Policy.
He said with the end of PFM’s contract approaching, staff
issued a Request for Proposals (RFPs) in November of 2015.
RTD received 11 proposals in total. Through the evaluation
process it was narrowed down to two top candidates: Public
Finance Management (PFM) and Public Trust Advisors (PTA).
He explained that these firms were ranked equally so RTD
issued a best and final offer to ensure the best possible pricing
was obtained. It was determined that PTA had the best
overall proposal.
Brenden Morgan stated that funding for the first year of this
contract was included in the 2016 Budget. Funding for the
four option years would need to be appropriated in future RTD
budgets.
Director Archuleta inquired how much RTD made from
investments in 2015. He also wondered how much RTD pays
for management of these investments. Brenden Morgan
stated that 2015’s report would be available next month. He
said in 2016 RTD expects to earn about $1.5 million. He
stated that RTD would pay up to $175,000 for investment
advisor services in 2016. He explained that the way the
contract is structured is that RTD pays three and a half
hundredths of a percent of any assets under PTA’s
management. Director Archuleta expressed his surprise that
staff would ask the Board to approve a recommendation when
they could not tell the Board how much RTD made last year.
Director Bagley shared that PFM recently made a presentation
to the Denver Union Station Project Authority Board, which he
was very impressed by. He asked if his understanding that
the two proposals were fairly similar in scope and technical
ability was correct and that the request for a best and final
offer brought the decision down to a matter of cost. Brenden
Morgan said that was generally correct. The Review
Committee looked at the proposals without having access to
the cost information; the Committee just rated the proposals
based on their technical merit. Once Procurement calculated
the scores to include cost, Public Finance Management and
Public Trust Advisors were tied. Brenden Morgan explained
that the request for a best and final offer was a way for the

firms to move their proposals one way or the other in the
ranking.

Director Anderson pointed out that there are certain
requirements as to how public monies are invested in the
State of Colorado. She wondered if PTA complies with those
requirements. Brenden Morgan confirmed that RTD is
restricted by State Statute and further restricted by the RTD
Investment Policy as to how our funds can be invested. He
said that PTA is very familiar with the Colorado State Statutes
as they are based in Colorado and operate the largest
government investment pool in the State.
Director Anderson asked if she was correct in remembering
that the Investment Policy was recently approved by the
Board. Brenden Morgan stated that the Board approved the
Policy in November of 2015.
Director Deadwyler inquired if her understanding that there
was not a company managing RTD’s investments last year
was correct. Brenden Morgan stated that Public Finance
Management (PFM) is the company RTD has utilized for the
past 5 years. Director Deadwyler asked what the projected
earnings were for 2015 and how much RTD paid PFM.
Brenden Morgan said that the budget projected close to $1
million in earnings and RTD paid PFM approximately
$300,000.
Director Lasater commented that while staff may not have the
earnings for 2015, the projected versus actuals for the prior
four years should be available. He asked staff to provide this
information prior to the Board Meeting.
Heather Copp pointed out that the amount paid to the
investment advisor was not related to earnings but related to
the value of the assets managed by the firm.
Committee Chair Tobiassen commented that it is important to
remember that the firm is not helping RTD invest in stocks or

Director Sisk noted that he had some of the same concerns

C. Updates

• November 2015 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, noted that the November Monthly Financial
Status Report was included in the January 12, 2015 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.
Doug MacLeod reminded the Board that in October, sales and use tax was
5% under budget; however, in November it was 3% over budget. He
explained that in doing some checking with the Department of Revenue staff
learned that there was a timing issue with some of the reporting that lead to
the variances. He stated that year-to-date sales and use tax was 0.8%
under budget. Doug MacLeod pointed out that ridership continues to be
under budget, which is following the same trend that staff has seen for
around the last 6 months. He said that even through ridership was down
fare revenue improved for the month of November.
Director Bagley inquired if staff had any anecdotal information that might
give them a perspective as to how the revenue shortfall to budget might be
at the end of the year. Heather Copp stated that staff is hoping December
will hold its own or be slightly better. She said if we can end the year
around $5 million under budget we will be in good shape. Staff has been
planning to accommodate a $5-10 million shortfall. She commented that
staff would continue to present the estimated impact of fare revenue and
sales and use tax shortfalls to the budget as there was already concern for
2016.

Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that it is important to note
that many times the interest RTD is allowed to earn is capped.
She explained that it is a very complicated set of investments
to ensure we meet arbitrage regulations.

6.B

Director Lubow said she surmises that ridership is going down because gas
prices are so low so more people are driving. She noted this might continue
indefinitely. She wonders how staff takes this into account. Heather Copp
stated that there is an indirect correlation between gas prices and ridership;
however, in 2016 it will be hard to isolate the factors that are impacting
ridership with gas prices being low, the fare increase and opening of all of
RTD’s new services at the same time. She said with more choices of where
to travel there may be an increase in ridership even with lower gas prices.

Heather Copp reminded the Board that the public Smart Card pilot program
went live on January 1st, along with many other initiatives. She asked Kim
Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology, to provide the Board
with an update.
Kim Heldman began by recognizing what a tremendous team effort
everything had been. She thanked all of the people who worked tirelessly
over the holidays to make this a success. She shared that Day Pass printers
have been installed and are operational on all fixed-route buses. Kim
Heldman noted that RTD sent out 1,000 vouches for Smart Cards and
through Sunday, January 10, 265 Smart Cards had been issued at RTD
Sales Outlets. The programing for the new fare structure across the entire
system went live on January 1. Additionally, new platform validator layouts
and stickers were updated to address recommendations made by the
National Federation of the Blind of Colorado. Finally, the real-time data feed
for third party developers went live over the New Year’s weekend.
Director Archuleta shared that he heard some drivers were putting bags over
their fare/ticketing machines and letting people ride for free. Kim Heldman
said she believes this was related to a handful of issues in the validators for
the Smart Cards. She reiterated that this was not system wide and had no
impact on revenue.
Director Archuleta asked how the new printers were working. Kim Heldman
explained that there had been some issues as well, but again, it was not a
widespread issue. The issues were very typical of a project of this size and
magnitude.
Director Walker shared that he rode the bus almost every day the previous
week and noticed everything moving very smoothly. He said there were
some stalls when people were trying to figure out what to do but overall it
was a very seamless transition.
Interim General Manager Genova thanked the staff that worked on all of
RTD’s changes over the holidays as there were many people involved.

D. Other Matters

Bruce Abel noted that, as has been discussed for several months, RTD has been
experiencing some very meaningful labor shortages for both fixed route and
paratransit operators. He reminded the Board that staff continually tracks the hours
of lost service. RTD provides approximately 10K hours of service on an average
weekday. Through the first six months of 2015 we were averaging between 7 and
14 hours of lost service per month. Bruce Abel pointed out that this is a
percentage so small Excel cannot even calculate it. However, beginning in
June/July RTD began to see operator shortages manifesting themselves in a slight
increase in lost service hours. At this time staff began to have conversations
about things like signing bonuses and other retention strategies.
Bruce Abel explained that the hours of lost service grew to 150 hours in October
and 500 in November, meaning that Excel could now calculate the percentage of
hours of service lost at two tenths of one percent. He commented that while this
is a very small percentage it is still not acceptable.
Bruce Abel reiterated that steps have been taken to increase RTD’s recruitment
efforts; however, it is also a retention issue. He said that steps have also been
taken to address issues such as less desirable shifts. Finally, in addition to
recruitment and retention issues, there is also the issue of the legalization of
marijuana. He said that anecdotally he can tell the Board that when 10 people are
given tentative offers of employment only 3 will get hired. He stated that with the
improving economy recruitment will continue to be a struggle but staff is pulling out
all the stops.
Bruce Abel recognized that there have been questions as to the process staff
follows when dropping a run. He explained that dispatch will first look to find
routes that have the highest service frequencies. Also, staff continues to try and
find another operator so that perhaps only one hour of service is lost on an eight
hour run.
Director Menten commented that while the percentage of lost service hours may be
small, to the passenger that does not get picked up it is a big deal. She inquired
how many people will become long term employees out of every 20 that complete
training. Bruce Abel stated that in reviewing separations between July and
September, over half of those leaving had been employees for less than a year. He
explained that getting operators to stay past the first year was one of the things
staff was trying to address through deferred signing bonuses, incentives for split
shifts, etc.

Heather Copp asked Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, to
speak to the Board about the driver shortage issue and its impact on service.

6.B

Director Menten asked how many additional operators RTD needed to ensure we
did not have any dropped runs. Bruce Abel stated we would need about 6 classes
of 20 trainees to get back to where staff wanted to be based on current attrition
rates.

Director Lubow asked how RTD could better communicate with our riders if their
route was dropped. Bruce Abel explained that using our current Rider Alert system
was a challenge as Rider Alerts would go to all riders of the route; however, since
staff continues to try and fill dropped runs, a route that is dropped at 5:00 a.m.
may have a driver for the 6:00 a.m. trip. Director Lubow asked staff to think about
how we could improve the alert process because if a person is waiting for a bus
that does not show up it is really a bummer.
Director Lubow said she heard from a constituent that Longmont is last on the list
for replacement drivers if a route is dropped because Longmont is not a highly
dense area. Bruce Abel stated that he cannot say that is accurate but knows that
Longmont is not having an issue with lost hours of service as is being experienced
in other parts of the District.
Director Hoy informed the Board that he was recently speaking with Director
Francone, who was unable to attend this evening, about Route 77. He said that
she feels this is a route that is continually dropped and is very concerned about it.
Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated
that dispatch does not want it to appear that any route is being picked on;
however, after evaluating the frequency of service, the route that has the longest
service hours is the route that gets filled first. For example, if one dropped route is
only one hour and another is four, dispatch will try to fill the four hour route first.
She explained that this can make it seem as if one route is being affected more
than other routes, such as Route 77. When a trend develops staff will focus their
efforts on that route to address the issue but it is really a juggling act.
Director Solano noted that in the telecom arena, which is where he comes from,
there was a group of technicians on pager duty in case another technician called in
sick or did not show up. He wondered if staff had considered something similar.
Bruce Abel explained that RTD did have extra operators come in to be “on call” but
unfortunately due to the labor shortage the labor pool is still not large enough to
cover all of the needs. He stated that the issues had more to do with the number
of operators as opposed to the processes. Director Solano thinks there is a way
that all the dropped routes can be covered.

Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten wondered about the maximum number of trainees that could be in
one class. Bruce Abel said the current maximum was 20; however, if staff had 40
people ready to start training they would find a way to train them all.

6.B

Director Bagley shared that, as the Board is probably aware, he has been serving on
the Denver Union Station Project Authority along with Marla Lien on behalf of RTD.
He said he wanted to report on some really outstanding figures he just received. In
2009 CBRE, a commercial real estate firm, made projections during the height of
the recent recession as to what kind of revenues would come forth for sales and
use tax collections as well as property taxes. He stated that property tax
collections are pledged at approximately $12.1 million or 274% over the 2009
projections for 2016. Additionally, sales and use tax collections were 617%
greater than the 2009 projections. He thinks these are fantastic numbers and
noted that there are estimates that some of the loans could be paid by 2026, which
is 15 years earlier than first thought.
Director Folska asked Director Bagley to email a copy of the statistics to the Board.
He said he would have staff send the information.

Committee Chair Tobiassen believes the real time bus data can be very helpful if a
run is dropped as the passenger can see when the next bus will be arriving to make
the appropriate decision about what to do next. Bruce Abel noted that there are
still issues with the real time data if a run is dropped as it will just display the
scheduled route time; however, this is something that Bus Operations will work
with IT and Communications to see what can be done.

B. Recommended Actions
Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Board that most of the recommended
actions on the agenda were housekeeping items. She noted that State Law
dictates that contracts cannot go on indefinitely. Most of the actions this evening
are renewals of contracts that are already in place. She hopes that the Board can
get through the agenda in an efficient manner.

• April 2016 Service Change
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the April 2016 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of
approximately $301,100 and, further, to authorize the Interim General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for
private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 19, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that this is the one action he would not classify as
housekeeping. He reminded the Board that normally these
service changes would be implemented in May, but they had
been moved forward to coincide with the University of
Colorado A Line opening. He noted that the service plan for
the University of Colorado A Line was approved in October
and these service plan changes are very minor in comparison.

Director Francone was absent.

6.C

He asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and
Scheduling, to review the recommendations.

Bruce Abel informed the Board that staff has worked with the
City and County of Denver (City) and the Downtown Denver
Partnership (DDP) to investigate various scenarios for the Meet
in the Streets events over the summer. Initially the City and
DDP requested the 16th Street Mall Shuttle be moved to 15th
and 17th Streets for 13 consecutive weekends. After ongoing
conversations, RTD staff is recommending 5 consecutive
weekends between Saturday June 25 and Sunday July 24.
Bruce Abel said that during the Meet in the Streets events,
staff wants to work with the City and DDP to evaluate
ridership not just on the Mall Shuttle, but throughout the entire
system. The Market Research Department will be working to
assess the pre, during and post reactions from our customers.
He stated that the City, DDP and RTD also want to look at
changes in business along the Mall in terms of sales volume as
well as other qualitative measures. He believes removing the
Mall Shuttles from 16th Street for five consecutive weekends
provides the opportunity for meaningful analysis.
Bruce Abel acknowledged Brad Buchanan, Bar Chadwick,
David Gaspers and Jason Whitlock from the City and County
of Denver and John Desmond from the Downtown Denver
Partnership, who were all in attendance this evening.
Director Solano called for the question and Director Folska
seconded the question. Committee Chair Anderson asked for
a voice vote on the motion to call the question. The motion
failed with no one in favor.
Director Lubow asked how much it would cost RTD to move
the Mall Shuttles to 15th and 17th Streets. Bruce Abel
explained that there are two components that make up the
cost to RTD. The first cost is related to maintaining the
service frequency levels that RTD runs currently along the 16th
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jessie Carter shared that three public meetings were held in
December with only three participants. He explained that is
largely due to the changes being very benign. He stated that
the most notable changes are on the 16th Street Mall Shuttle
for the Meet in the Streets events, the increase in peak period
frequency for the Free Metro Ride, a new grant funded Call-nRide in Superior and the cancellation of the Belmar Call-n-Ride.

6.C

Director Lubow wondered if staff was talking to the City about
just helping RTD with the cost of the additional buses or if
staff had asked the City to help offset any funding RTD might
lose from the FTA formula funding. Bruce Abel stated that the
conversations were not relative to revenue lost but the funding
of increased service. Director Lubow hopes staff will think
about speaking with the City about both funding issues.
Director Bagley expressed his support of staff’s
recommendation related to the 16th Street Mall; however, he
believes there still needs to be ongoing analysis about issues
surrounding the Meet in the Streets events. There are many
issues to consider such as safety and security, marijuana use
around the 16th Street Mall, urban camping, homelessness,
etc. He said the design of the mall transit way also needs to
be explored as some portions have a center island section and
other portions do not. He hopes the Board can get additional
information from this summer’s Meet in the Streets events as
he does not feel what was provided previously was sufficient.
Director James thanked all those in attendance from the City
and DDP. He believes this is illustrative of the strong
partnership that has been created. He agrees that the issues
raised by Director Bagley are very important ones. He knows
the City and DDP are addressing them with studies that are
being done right now. He thanked staff for being collaborative
with the City and DDP as well. He recognized that they
wanted more than RTD could give but he thinks we have hit
the sweet spot. He believes the 16th Street Mall has the
potential to extend what was done at Denver Union Station.
Director Solano thinks the demand for security during the
Meet in the Streets events is going to be high and expressed a
concern about the cost of that added security. Bruce Abel

Street Mall. Since running on 15th and 17th has a longer travel
time, additional buses would need to be added to maintain the
frequency. He said staff projects the additional buses to cost
$54K for the 5 weekends. He said that staff is in talks with
the City about funding the additional buses. Bruce Abel stated
that in addition to needing more buses, staff also anticipates a
potential loss of FTA formula funding if ridership loses on the
Mall Rider are not offset by ridership increases elsewhere in
the system. Staff estimates the maximum potential loss to
RTD to be approximately $200K based on information from
last year’s Meet in the Streets events.

6.C

Director Hoy asked for clarification as to how much the City
would be paying RTD for moving our service off the 16th
Street Mall. He wanted confirmation that the action this
evening was to approve moving the Mall Shuttle to 15th and
17th Streets without any payment from the City at this time.
Bruce Abel stated that was correct. He reiterated that staff
has opened the dialog with the City to see if they had the
budget to help us increase the frequency on some of the
weekends along 15th and 17th Streets.
Director Sisk shared his support for staff’s recommendation in
response to the City and DDP’s request for the Meet in the
Streets events. He said he was more concerned with the
Flatiron Flyer 4. He recognized that staff is currently working
on some of the issues but said he would be voting no today to
ensure the dialog stayed open.
Director Bagley asked staff to provide the Board with the
results of the surveys that were conducted during the previous
Meet in the Streets events prior to the Board meeting. He also
asked that the Board be provided the survey results for the
upcoming Meet in the Streets events as quickly as possible
over the summer.
Director Menten stated that she would be voting no. She does
not feel it makes sense to expand service, as is done in most
cases in the April Service Changes, when there is already a
driver shortage.

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 19, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten inquired if taxpayers were putting out capital
to create vanpools. Bruce Abel stated that RTD has provided
funding to DRCOG to support the Way to Go vanpool program
since 2001. He explained that prior to RTD’s support, the
vanpool had very limited participation. The issues that were
presented to RTD were an inability to find drivers because 15
passenger vans were awkward and the cost structure was
challenging. RTD made the decision to provide subsidy
funding to allow a customer to pay approximately the cost of
a monthly bus pass while still allowing DRCOG to have enough
funding to run the vanpool on a financially sustainable basis.
He said that RTD’s funds are used to help offset the cost of
insurance, fuel, capital, etc.

• 5311 Cost Share Agreements
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that

agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to
provide RTD financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (nonurbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson

program where federal funds are given to communities to
support transportation in non-urbanized areas. Those funding
amounts are based on things like population density, area size,
etc. He said that those counties used to receive the grants
directly from the Federal Government but when they became

• Service Increase for Transdev On Demand
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
amend the Transdev On Demand ADA paratransit services contract #13-DH035 to increase the level of Access-a-Ride services per month at a reduced
per-trip cost ($36.50 for contract year 2 and $37.23 for contract year 3) to
be effective 2/1/16 through 12/31/16. This represents an increase of
$460,000 in the overall contract costs. This action also approves the
transfer of funds necessary to fund this increase in contract cost.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 19, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten asked what staff meant in the Board Report
when it indicated that the forces working against the
dedicated vehicle providers have not had an equal impact on
the cab industry. Bruce Abel explained that meant that the
challenges faced by RTD in hiring drivers have not been
experienced by the Taxi industry. He said that services like
Uber and Lyft have led to Taxi drivers looking for other ways
to expand their revenue stream, meaning they are now
available for RTD to hire.

 Greyhound Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel shared with the Board that staff had received a request from
Greyhound to work with RTD to utilize Denver Union Station more in their
operations. He said there is a great deal of analysis that must be done but
staff wanted to keep the Board informed that a request had been made. He
indicated that staff would keep the board appraised throughout the process.
Director Menten asked if Greyhound was supported wholly by its customers
or if it was subsidized in any way. Bruce Abel stated that Greyhound is a
private, for-profit corporation. He knows there are federal programs to get
companies like Greyhound to run routes that would not otherwise be
profitable but he does not know if Greyhound participates in any of those
programs.

D. Other Matters
Director Sisk thanked everyone for their hard work and participation in the opening
of the Flatiron Flyer. He said the Ribbon Cuttings and VIP Reception were really
outstanding events. He commended the Marketing department for their efforts. He
stated that the work was not done yet as there was always tweaking with new
service but he is confident in what the staff will do.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked Director Sisk for his service as Chair for the
last two years. She thought he did a commendable job.
Director James thanked Director Sisk for his service as Chair and for initiating the
motion to reconsider the April 2016 Service Changes. He believes this is an
opportunity for RTD to partner with the heart of the Metro area.
Bruce Abel noted that in general the launch of the Flatiron Flyer went well;
however, there have been some challenges, especially on the Flatiron Flyer 4. He
said he would characterize the challenges as the type of problem we would like to
have, which is too many people wanting to ride our service. He shared that

the agreements. He said that the list of agreements was included in the

January Board Meeting Agenda Review
Committee Chair Tobiassen provided the initial review of the agenda. Interim General
Manager Genova indicated that we have a number of retirees and are awaiting to see if
any of them plan to be present.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to approve moving the January 19
Board agenda to the full Board.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley indicated he will not have an update from the GM
Oversight and Performance Management committee but would
remind the Board of the upcoming joint Board-staff advance for
March 5, 2016. Paula Perdue shared that we have issued a RFP for a
facilitator. When the facilitator is selected, the Chair of the Board
and General Manager would sit with the facilitator to set expectations

for the Advance. Most likely, the facilitator will contact the full Board
members for their input.

Chair Tobiassen noted that we had some confusion on the
recommended action item for the April 2016 service changes.
IGM Genova indicated that staff had outreached to the City of Denver
around the Board’s concern on the potential loss of revenue due to
the federal government requirements. The City is taking this under
consideration but has not provided a response. We hope to hear
from them by next Tuesday’s meeting. Director Deadwyler inquired
about what would be the correct process if they wanted to change
the 16 street mall change but not vote down the overall action. IGM
Genova explained that the Board’s option would be to do an
amendment on the 16 Street Mall item and follow the Robert’s Rules
for voting on an amendment. Director Menten inquired what would it
take to make the loss of revenue issue cost neutral. Director Menten
also inquired if a dollar amount had been discussed with Denver.
IGM Genova stated that he was not sure but staff is looking at the
costs and possible impacts.
Director Folska expressed that cost is one of her concerns and she
would recommend postponement if costs are not known. Paula
Perdue asked for clarification that she meant postponement as an
amendment to the action item and not postponement of the action
item itself on the April 2016 Service Changes.
Director Bagley stated we need to find out their timeline from the City
of Denver on when they need an approval. We need to understand
the impact of a delay on them as well.
Director Walker shared that the data appears empirical and it may be
beneficial to partner with the City to understand the impact of the
planned Meet in the Street series. Director Deadwyler agreed with
this issue but pointed out that if these days can affect our ridership
to the point that we can lose some federal funding, she does not

Chair Tobiassen reminded the Committee that if they have a question
on a unanimous consent item, it is best to remove that item so it can
be discussed. Paula Perdue elaborated to say that if an item is not
removed from the unanimous consent agenda and someone votes no,
it is the same as having voted no on every item on that unanimous
consent agenda.

believe that RTD should have to eat this loss. Denver should pay for
it.
IGM Genova noted this could be a valuable experience for all of us as
Denver envision how to make the 16 st mall better. This is a great
opportunity to partner. We are concerned about the potential
reduction in ridership as well as remaining cost neutral. The type of
funding we are discussing is formula funding and part of the study
that RTD is participating in is there an opportunity to beef up
ridership in downtown in general during the Meet in the Street
events. He noted that 3 of these weekends will be Coors Rockies
games and perhaps this could end up increasing overall downtown
ridership. He shared that the detour off the 16 st mall would bypass
the Market Street to Union Station leg.
Director Deadwyler inquired about the Investment Advisor Services
and asked if we had paid the $300K to the service provider last year.
IGM Genova indicated this is true but noted that what we pay to the
service provider is a factor of the size of the investment portfolio and
not how much money we made or lost. We are under guidelines
around that. Chair Tobiassen also noted that it would be quite risky
to pay our advisor services based on our profit. This would
encourage risky type investments and would defeat the policy for
RTD.
Director Deadwyler asked about the action item on the purchase of
the 46-45” heavy-duty intercity buses. Her concern was when will
we start to have discussions around other types of buses that will
accommodate things like carts, baby strollers and other items that
people use to haul groceries and such. IGM Genova explained this
particular action was more for the Over-the-Road buses similar to
Flatiron Flyer. The type of buses that Director Deadwyler was
addressing are more of the inner-city buses.
Director Solano inquired how was the selection made on who would
service or provide the associated components. He has heard from
local suppliers who question why we hire foreign companies to
provide these parts. IGM Genova explained that sometimes it is more
cost effective and efficient to have the parts provided from the
manufacturer; moreover, we issue requests for competitive bids for
this type service. Normally it is based on the cost.

Other Matters


Director Bagley commented that he was present to support the new Executive
Committee. He noted the responsibility of the committee is to provide high level
governance and not staff-related items. They need to understand the Bylaws and
adhere to Robert’s Rules. They need to encourage other Board members and to be
respectful of each other, the staff and the constituents. The Committee needs to
help us instill a culture of mutual respect and we should not have or exhibit an
adversary relationship with staff in a public setting.
Director Deadwyler thanked Director Bagley for his comments. She stated that she
had a conversation with Chair Tobiassen on his philosophy as well. She is
committed to doing her part to be more neutral and respectful. She also thinks that
sometimes as part of the attempt to understand information that staff has provided
to them, it may appear they are being adversarial when they are seeking
understanding.



Director Bagley shared that he had a discussion with a constituent around the
dropped service issue. He tried to explain what is happening with our hiring efforts,
the effect of a more positive economy on our ability to hire drivers and also some
of the impacts of Colorado approval of marijuana on passing drug tests, etc. There
was a lot of discussion on this issue especially since RTD follows the federal law on
drug testing (CDL licenses, etc) while we are a state that has approved marijuana
usage on a local basis. Director Solano and others made the point that this is a
growing issue that RTD needs to get its arm around as to how we can handle this

when it may affect our ability to hire. IGM Genova noted that currently all the data
we have around this is anecdotal and cautioned the Committee on using this
information. Director Bagley spoke of the law of unintended consequences.
Director Menten added that our shortage of workers affect not only drivers but
mechanics. We are short about 38 mechanics and could that be affecting the
number of buses we need to order as well?

General Manager Executive Search Committee Update
Chair Sisk shared that the General Manager Executive Search Committee (GMESC)
completed a very long journey last week that he was honored to be a part of. He said at
5:37 p.m. on Friday, December 11, the Board voted to enter into contract negotiations
with Interim General Manager Genova. He acknowledged that IGM Genova faced some
stiff competition from the other finalists; however, IGM Genova’s accomplishments,
credentials, and passion for RTD made him the Board’s selection. Chair Sisk believes one
of the challenges for IGM Genova is that RTD needs to do better. RTD has been at a very
high level but we need to exceed that level. He recognized that this is a tough
commitment but knows that IGM Genova can make that commitment.
Chair Sisk thanked Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of Directors, for all of her
dedication and hard work throughout this process. He recognized the GMESC members
for their time as well. He reiterated that this was a long journey but one that was very
thorough and transparent.

XIV. Motion to Take from Table
A.

2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award

It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option
to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance
through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually
between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board
of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to
exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been
reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist
and no additional positions for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has
reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to
the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
Motion to
Take From

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: January 6, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 4, 2016

Board Meeting Date: January 19, 2016

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 40 40' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $17,677,000 for the purchase of 40 additional 40’
transit buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a quantity of 40 additional 40’ transit buses. Thirty (30) new buses are for the replacement of
the remaining 30 – 2000 Series Orion buses, and 10 buses are for the support of service expansion.
The remaining 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are now 16 years old and have accumulated on average 670,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer, Orion Bus
Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts required for the repair of the buses
are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the replacement of the
Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014 and 64 buses in
2015. Due to the increased service demand, RTD has kept 30 Orion buses in continued service. The
replacements for these buses and the 10 expansion buses have been approved in the adopted SBP.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary
price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 110
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
On February 17, 2015 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 64
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 59

12.A

The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger
count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as walker, child stroller and
shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
quantity of 40-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$17,677,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2016 Adopted
Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Gillig for the purchase of
40-40’ transit buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Contract Award for the Purchase of Up to 241
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to award a contract to Master’s Transportation
for the purchase of up to 241 Goshen cutaway buses for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services at a
price not to exceed $14,580,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Cutaway Buses, Model Years from 2005 to 2011, currently being used
for the Access-a-Ride service.
RTD issued an Information for Bids (IFB) on October 19, 2015. Five bids were received on December 8,
2015. Master’s Transportation was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus
configuration. The IFB allowed RTD to purchase cutaway buses for a five year period with each
successive year pricing being based on the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment set by the US
Department of Labor Producer Price Index (PPI).
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract to Master’s Transportation for the purchase of up
to 241 Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace the 2005 to 2011 Model Years Goshen and
Startrans buses used for the Access-a-Ride service and 14 buses (10 AAR’s and 4 CNR’s) will be
acquired to supplement the existing Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride bus fleets for service expansion.

DISCUSSION
RTD’s Access-a-Ride Service currently operates 227 Goshen and Startrans cutaway buses of the Model
Years 2005 to 2011. These buses have exceeded their Federal Transit Administration (FTA) service life
of 5 years or 150,000 miles. The buses to be replaced are 5 to 10 years in age and have accumulated
between 118,000 and 355,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The new Goshen cutaway buses will be up to 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an extended
sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the Calln-Ride buses and three wheelchair access areas for the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA
compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security camera system per the current standard on
all new RTD buses.

5311 Cost Share Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2016 and for amounts
not to exceed $364,933.00 for Boulder County, $358,849.00 for Adams County and $111,187.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Since
1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of
transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal
grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $364,933.00 in 2016. RTD shall also
contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams
County in amount not to exceed $358,849.00 in 2016.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $111,187.00.00 in 2016.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service in 2015 resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.39 to approximately
$2.48 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.5 passengers per hour in 2014 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at

Packet Pg. 63

12.C

approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $16.93 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average of 1.2 boarding per hour and a
subsidy per passenger trip of approximately $57.30 in 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2016 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Service Increase for Transdev On Demand

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the Transdev On Demand ADA paratransit
services contract #13-DH-035 to increase the level of Access-a-Ride services per month at a reduced
per-trip cost ($36.50 for contract year 2 and $37.23 for contract year 3) to be effective 2/1/16
through 12/31/16. This represents an increase of $460,000 in the overall contract costs. This
action also approves the transfer of funds necessary to fund this increase in contract cost.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, All Aboard Transit Services, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev On Demand, to provide Access-a-Ride
paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of the service providers (All Aboard, MV,
and Via) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide the service. The fourth provider (Transdev On Demand)
uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide the service. The current Access-a-Ride
contracts were implemented in April of 2014 following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The current
Access-a-Ride service model is a change from the previous service model. Previously, the service
had been provided by four (4) providers all using RTD-provided vehicles.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the three dedicatedvehicle service providers (All Aboard, MV and Via) were all planning to hire a portion of the operators
that were at the time employed by Global Transportation because Global Transportation was not
awarded a new Access-a-Ride service contract. Due to a variety of reasons, a large number of
former Global operators decided to find employment elsewhere. Given the extremely tight labor
market in the Denver area, the three dedicated vehicle providers struggled to meet the demand for
service. Despite their aggressive hiring campaigns, all of the providers continue to be challenged to
find sufficient numbers of operators. The legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado has
added to the challenge, and the ever increasing pattern of traffic congestion has increased demand
for more vehicles and forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center to assign more and more service to
Transdev. Surprisingly, the forces working against the dedicated vehicle providers have not have an
equal impact on the cab industry.
The reliance on Transdev to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that the dedicated vehicle service
providers have been unable to provide, has resulted in an increase in the number of trips provided by
Transdev On Demand in 2015. The dedicated-vehicle service providers continue to experience
difficulties hiring qualified drivers. Consequently, it will be necessary to continue expanding the
service provided by Transdev On Demand through 2016 so that RTD will be able to meet the needs
of our ADA paratransit eligible customers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:

Packet Pg. 65

12.D

There is no financial impact. The increased Transdev On Demand contract costs will be offset by a
decrease in service levels on other existing ADA paratransit services contracts. There 2016
approved budget includes funding for Via, MV, and All Aboard Transit service budgets that will be
transferred into the Transdev On Demand service budget to cover these costs.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that Transdev On Demand can provide additional
Access-a-Ride service thereby improving our ability to provide on-time and reliable service to our
passengers.
2)
Do not approve the recommended action. This course of action is not recommended as it will
diminish our ability to provide appropriate service to our passengers.

April 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the April 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $290,966, and a net annualized cost of approximately $65,000
after grant funding; further, the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the April 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $290,966 and a net annualized cost of approximately $65,000
after grant funding and, further, to authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. This
proposal is in concert with the implementation of the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and
Rail Service plan, already adopted by the Board in October 2015. The proposals herein include a mix of
service enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service reductions, which include the
discontinuance of seasonal school related service. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver and one meeting was held in Lakewood at the Blake Administration
building. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment
B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
April 2016 service change:
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Routes proposed for service improvements:
Broomfield Call-n-Ride: Grant funded, Call-n-Ride area expansion
Free Metro Ride: Grant funded, increase in peak frequency
Superior Call-n-Ride: Grant funded, new Call-n-Ride
Routes proposed for service reductions:
Belmar Call-n-Ride: discontinue service due to ridership performance
Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 16 – West Colfax: reroute trips terminating at 10th Broadway into the Civic Center Station.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA: Re-route via Northwest Parkway and E-470
Golden Call-n-Ride: Detour of services away from Colorado School of Mines Housing
Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287: Minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: Schedule adjustments
Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Discontinue seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1W, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 50, 52, 65, 73, 206/206F and 208/208F
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE
Change to summer schedules
Board Approved Amendment:
Flatiron Flyer 4 and Flatiron Flyer 86: Flatiron Flyer 4 will be removed from service at US 36 & Sheridan
Station. The Flatiron Flyer 86 is a new route providing four peak-period trips, morning and evening,
between US 36 Sheridan Station and Civic Center Station.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is includes an estimated $278,500 annualized in
grant funded costs. A base system savings estimated at $202,500 annualized, derived from a service
reduction, is also included in this proposal. The Board approved amendment for Flatiron Flyer 4 and 86
has an estimated annualized cost of $215,000, resulting in the net cost impact of approximately
$65,000 after grant funding.

EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed April 2016 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A LOOK AHEAD – Spring 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Board of Directors that the Board accept the staff
recommendation to detour the 16th Street Free Mall Ride service from the 16th Street Mall
to operate along 15th Street and 17th Street for ten days on five (5) consecutive weekends
(Saturdays and Sundays) starting Saturday June 25, 2016 and running through Sunday
July 23, 2016 contingent on the City/County of Denver contributing $27,000 to help
defray the cost of maintaining existing Free Mall Ride frequency on half (five) of those
days.
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors moved to divide the staff 16th Street Mall Shuttle service “Meet in
the Streets” recommendation from the April 2016 Service Change in the January 19,
2016 meeting of the Board of Directors. This allowed a more thorough discussion of the
proposal from the City of Denver and the subsequent staff recommendations concerning
weekend operations on the 16th Street Mall in July 2016.
DISCUSSION
The 16th Street Mall opened in 1982, allowing RTD to intercept buses from the north at
Market street station (now DUS) and from the south at Civic Center Station. Through the
operation of the Free Mall Ride, RTD was able to remove 550 bus trips per day from the
Downtown Denver City streets. Currently the Free Mall Ride serves 22 bus routes at
Denver Union Station (DUS) and 30 bus routes at Civic Center Station (CCS), as well as 6
rail lines. Soon to add Flatiron Flyer and 4 Commuter Rail lines at DUS. Numerous
local/limited bus routes traverse the Mall at various points along 16th making the Free Mall
Ride the “spine” of the Downtown network of transit services. With the advent of rail
operations the Free Mall continues to be our primary "first" and "last mile solution" for
transit riders accessing downtown Denver.
Ridership activity on the Free Mall Ride is the highest of any single bus route in the RTD.
The service averages approximately 45,000 boardings on a weekday, 25,000 on an
average Saturday and 18,000 on an average Sunday. This adds up to nearly 14 million
boardings per year or nearly 14% of RTD’s annual ridership. The overall average
passenger trip length is .5 (one-half) mile versus ¼ mile average walk distance in urban or

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

13.E.b

The Free Mall Ride operates weekday from 5:00 AM - 2:00 AM; frequency ranges from 90
seconds to 15 minutes (generally from 90 seconds to 4 minutes). Saturday service is
operated from 5:30 AM- 1:30 AM; frequency ranges from 4 minutes to 15 minutes
(generally 4-6minutes). Sunday service operates from 6:00 AM- 1:30 AM; frequency
ranges from 4 minutes to 15 minutes (generally from 4-6 minutes).
The 16th Street Mall had a $76.1 million dollars construction cost, with 80% funding
through UMTA (predecessor to the FTA). The operating expense in of the Free Mall Ride in
2013 (fully allocated) was $11.7M dollars. The service generated over 14 million
passenger boardings, resulting in a subsidy per passenger of $0.84, the lowest in the RTD
network. Annual maintenance cost of the 16th Street Mall is approximately $1 million per
year. It should be noted that RTD receives federal funding of approximately $8.9 M per
year in various forms of funding (fixed guideway, Capital maintenance formula funding
etc.).
In cooperation with the City of Denver and the Downtown Denver Partnership, weekend
service of the Free Mall Ride is proposed to be placed on an alternative path for the month
of July 2016. Alternative service would be provided on 15th and 17th Streets using the
Free Metro Ride vehicles, as has been done during select Sundays in the summer of 2015.
While the initial request from the City of Denver proposes that alternative service be
offered for much of the summer 2016, RTD staff is recommending that the proposed
service be limited to the month of July 2016. Reducing the number of weekends impacted
by the Meet in the Streets project avoids impacting mobility during a number of
Downtown special events scheduled next year. The staff recommendation also allows for
a comparison of ridership interaction between the newly introduced University of Colorado
A Line and Free Mall Ride normal and alternative services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall net financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $54,000
annualized. The City of Denver has agreed to support this proposal by providing $27,000
in funding, which represents half of the estimated cost of maintaining existing service
frequency on the Free Mall Ride service during “Meet in the Street” activities.

1/3 mile walk distance in suburban environments. It should be noted that like all RTD

Request for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016

CC:
FROM:
DATE:
RE:

The City and County of Denver's Community Planning and Development in association with the Downtown Denver
Partnership and the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District are formally requesting RTD provide
alternative 16th Street Mall shuttle service during multiple Meet in the Streets (MITS) events during the summer
of 2016. The Meet in the Street events would occur Saturdays and Sundays from the weekend after Memorial Day
until the weekend prior to Labor Day. This would be 13 consecutive weekends starting Saturday June 4th, 2016 and
run weekly through Sunday August 28th, 2016. Alternative Mall shuttle service would be provided on 15th and 17th
Streets in place of 16th Street.
This request will further The Mall Experience Project, one of Mayor Hancock's three initiatives to Activate Denver's
Urban Core. The project, led by the City of Denver in partnership with the Downtown Denver Partnership, aims to
guide improvements to the 16th Street Mall that will make it a better place for people. To achieve that, and with
the help of consultants Gehl Architects, we will be studying Mall activity and conducting public outreach to identify
ways to help the Mall reach its full potential as a welcoming place in the heart of our downtown. The 2016 MITS
events are one of several short-term recommendations made by Gehl in the report entitled "Downtown Denver
161h St Mall: Small Steps Towards Big Change" (draft report attached).
Key elements of MITS 2016 request:
•
Builds upon previous MITS events organized by the Downtown Denver Partnership in 2014 (2 events) and
2015 (5 events) that used the same alternative mall shuttle service.
•

Maximizes outreach, programming, and predictability for all users by occurring on a regular basis each
Saturday and Sunday during summer months.

•

Allows survey work during all MITS events, each with varying levels of activation in a more regular
occurring timeframe. In this case, "survey" means observation, pedestrian counts and man-on-the-street

•

Coordinates with CCD departments, DDP, and RTD to observe and measure the impact of MITS on the
multimodal experience on and in the vicinity of the 16th Street.

•

Fosters the strengthening of relationships with key downtown stakeholders that contribute to 161h Street
Mall being a world-class destination- a premier public space for people and an authentic Denver
experience. Potential stakeholder partnerships include Visit Denver, Colorado Rockies, Denver Art

intercept surveys.

Museum, etc.
We will work closely with RTD with all necessary communication, wayfinding, and outreach efforts regarding the
alternative mall shuttle service and other transit options before and during MITS 2016.

To the RTD Board of Directors:
I’m writing today seeking your support for the City and County of Denver’s request for alternate mall

Re: Request for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016
Dear Mr. Genova,
The Downtown Denver Pa1tnership (the Paitnership) is writing this letter in
support of the City and County of Denver's (City) formal request to the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) to provide alternative 16th Street Mall
shuttle service during Meet in the Street (MITS) events on Saturdays and
Sundays during the summer of2016. The alternative shuttle service would be
provided on l 51h Street and 17th Street.
The Partnership and the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District
(BID) have worked closely with the City, RTD and many other stakeholders in
holding two MITS events on nonconsecutive Sundays in July and August, 2014,
and five MITS events on nonconsecutive Sundays in June, July and August
2015. Funding for these events was provided for by the BID, and managed
closely by Paitnership staff. RTD provided the alternative shuttle service
requested above on all of those occasions. All of these events were well­
attended and extremely well-received by the public, and served to enhance the
vitality and sense ofsafety on the l 61h Street Mall. Of equal importance, from
our observations and feedback we received, the alternative service met the needs
of Downtown transit users very effectively - we received many positive
responses about the events and are unaware of any complaints about transit
service levels during these events from any of our constituents or anyone in the
general public.
The repeated success ofMITS over the last two years has encouraged us to look
at expanding MITS activities to the 13 weekends mentioned above. It is our
belief that conducting MITS on both days, and on consecutive weekends, will:
•

allow us to maximize our coordination, outreach and communications
about these events,

DOWNTOWN DENVER EVENTS. I NC,

•

give all interested parties and the general public greater predictability
and consistency regarding access to Downtown during these weekends,

•

maximize our ability to study the effects and changes generated by
holding MITS events in a sequential fashion, and

•

continue to strengthen the excellent working relationships already in
place between RTD, the Partnership, the BID and the City.

13.E.g

We have spoken to a wide variety of our members, BID property owners and
downtown hotel representatives (including the Sheraton Denver, the Hyatt
Regency Convention Center and the City Center Marriott) about this request,
and have received overwhelming and very positive support.
We will continue to work closely with RTD, the City and all of our other
Downtown partners and stakeholders regarding the necessary logistics,
communications, outreach and planning necessary to make MITS a success
again in 2016.

Re: Support for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016
Dear Mr. Genova,
VISIT DENVER, The Convention and Visitors Bureau, submits this letter in support of the City and County of Denver’s
request to the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to provide alternative 16th Street Mall shuttle service during Meet
in the Street (MITS) events on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays during Summer 2016.
The 16th Street Mall is Denver’s #1 tourist attraction. However, increasing security and safety concerns along the Mall
require new, innovative approaches to ensure this corridor is the city’s crown jewel. As has been demonstrated during
previous MITS, these events have been well-attended and well-received by the public, and served to enhance the vitality
and sense of safety on the Mall. To enable these successful events in 2016, we support alternative shuttle service
provided along 15th and 17th Streets, as was done previously, to effectively and conveniently transport residents and
visitors through the downtown core.
VISIT DENVER believes continuing MITS in Summer 2016 on consecutive weekends will:




benefit conventioneers and leisure visitors by making the Mall a weekend family-friendly safe destination and
gathering space to be enjoyed in a very different way from the way the Mall functions during the week
maximize coordination, outreach and communications efforts about these events to residents and visitors alike
by giving all interested parties and the general public greater predictability and consistency regarding access to
downtown during these weekends
better study the impacts generated by holding MITS events in a sequential fashion

VISIT DENVER is committed to continuing its collaboration between RTD, the City, Downtown Denver Partnership, and
other key stakeholders in assuring that all logistical details -including communicating these changes to visitors and
coordinating with other major events - will be addressed.
Sincerely,

Richard W. Scharf

Denver, Colorado 80202
Dear Mr. Genova,
Thank you for the invaluable service you provide to the citizens of Colorado.
On behalf of the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, I would like to express our support of the City
and the Downtown Denver Partnership's request for alternative shuttle service on 15th Street and
17th Street during their Meet in the Street (MITS) events proposed for summer 2016.
Many of our fans choose to use RTD transportation to and from our home games. Not only does
it help fans get to the ballpark, but it also serves as an asset to the City, as the 16th Street Mall
then becomes a pre-game and post-game destination. One of the main advantages for Rockies
fans that use the RTD lines into Downtown Denver has been the shuttle service that significantly
reduces the number of blocks they have to walk to reach the ballpark. Should that not be
available, it will encourage them to look for alternative transportation instead of utilizing the
RTD. We believe that the proposed alternative shuttle service will be a viable option for Rockies
fans on MITS event days, and therefore changing the service location on the dates of the MITS
would benefit all concerned parties and the community as a whole.
Ifyou have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at 303.312.2262.

Approval of Contract for Investment Advisor
Services

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: January 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a one year contract
plus four one year optional extensions to Public Trust Advisors (PTA) to perform RTD’s investment
advisor services. The new contract would begin March 1, 2016 with a cost of up to $175,000 for the
first year depending on the assets under management during the year. The cost of the optional years is
also dependent on the assets under management at that time. The cost for all four option years is
anticipated to be approximately $800,000, if executed. Total cost for five years is anticipated to be
$975,000.
BACKGROUND
RTD has utilized Public Finance Management (PFM) as investment advisor for the past five years in
relation to RTD’s bond proceeds and operating funds. With the end of this contract approaching, a
Request for Proposals (RFP) was published in November, 2015. Notifications regarding the procurement
were sent to a total of six financial institutions.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from eleven financial institutions. All Proposals received were evaluated and
scored according to the Selection Criteria included in the District’s RFP which were:






Cost of Services (20%)
Exhibited knowledge and understanding of the RTD’s investment parameters and related
Colorado statutes. (20%)
Specific strategy recommendations and approach in regard to the investment of proceeds.
(20%)
Qualifications, experience and ability of the firm and the individuals assigned to this
engagement in providing the services outlined in “Statement of Work”.
Overall completeness, clarity, and quality of the proposal and responsiveness to the RFP.
(20%)

Through this evaluation process, the following two firms were identified as the best value for RTD:



Public Finance Management (PFM)
Public Trust Advisors (PTA)

Packet Pg. 88

13.F

RTD issued a best and final offer request to these two firms to ensure the best possible pricing was
obtained. The proposal evaluation committee determined that Public Trust Advisors (PTA) had the best
overall proposal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the first year of this contract has been included in the 2016 Budget. Funding for the four
optional years would need to be appropriated in future RTD budgets. Funding for investment advisor
services is an annual recurring expenditure that is regularly included in the budget and SBP process.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager to execute all documents necessary
to award a contract to Public Trust Advisors to perform RTD’s investment advisor services.
This is the recommended action.
2) Do not approve the recommendation to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to Public Trust Advisors to perform RTD’s investment advisor
services. This is not the recommended action because it will delay having an investment
advisor available and staff has found Public Trust Advisors to have the best overall proposal.

Board Meeting Date: January 19, 2016

Subject:

Purchase of up to 46 - 45' Heavy Duty
Intercity Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 12FK002 with
Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 46 - 45-foot heavy duty intercity buses and
associated spare components at a price not to exceed $27,500,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance 1900 Series MCI intercity buses and 2800 Series Neoplan intercity
buses.
The RTD Board of Directors approved the purchase of 48 MCI intercity buses on May 22, 2012 and six
(6) additional MCI buses on November 27, 2012 as replacements for the 1998 model year 1900 Series
MCI buses.
The procurement was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) advertised on January 27, 2012.
Proposals were received on April 20, 2012, and MCI was determined the most responsive and
responsible proposer. The RFP allowed RTD to purchase additional MCI intercity buses for a five year
period with each successive year pricing being based on the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment
set by the US Department of Labor Producer Price Index (PPI).
On January 21, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 59
buses to replace 42 – Neoplan buses and to add 17 expansion buses for the US 36 BRT service.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to MCI to exercise the purchase
option for a quantity of up to 46 additional intercity buses. Forty-three (43) new buses are for the
replacement of the remaining 43 – 2800 Series Neoplan buses, and 3 buses are for the support of
service expansion.

DISCUSSION
RTD currently operates 43 buses of the 2001 Model Year 2800 Series Neoplan subfleet. These buses
have exceeded their Federal Transit Administration (FTA) service life of 12 years or 500,000 miles. The
buses are approaching 15 years in age and have accumulated, on the average, over 723,000 miles of
service each. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer,
Neoplan Corporation, went out of business several years ago. Replacement parts are difficult to obtain,
and many of the parts are simply no longer available. The requested new buses will replace the 43

Packet Pg. 90

13.G

remaining and soon-to-be obsolete Neoplan buses and 3 additional buses will be acquired to supplement
the existing fleet to meet increased service demand.
The MCI buses will be 45' long and have 57 passenger seats. The buses will be equipped with a
wheelchair lift and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. The clean diesel engines
will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the
existing buses. The buses will be equipped with the automatic passenger counting (APC) system and
the security digital camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to MCI to exercise the purchase option for a
quantity of up to 46 - 45’ intercity buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$27,500,000. The funding for this contract amendment is approved and available in the District’s 2016
Adopted Budget.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, MCI has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
To authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract
12FK002 with Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 46 - 45-foot heavy duty
intercity buses and associated spare components at a price not to exceed $27,500,000. This is
the recommended alternative.
2.

Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not recommended as it
would result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost
to the project.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the
University of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for
calendar year 2016 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,410,771.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,410,771.00 in 2016.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of
Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision
of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.9 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy
per HOP passenger trip of $1.66. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route service in
2014 ranged from an average of 34.7 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an average of 18.3
boardings per hour for suburban local service.

13.H

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2016 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service
so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

DRCOG Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is
for calendar year 2016 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $947,600.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be fiscally sustainable and to render regular,
on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the
costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 94

13.I

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 115 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.4 riders per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2015 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per
passenger seat used of approximately $3.79 and $2.47 for each seat sold. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.30 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.78 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $4.75 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2016 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting and increased demand for low productivity
transit service as an alternative.

Englewood Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation
of the art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2016 and
is for an amount not to exceed $301,189.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the
management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related
expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood.
The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged
a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 648.0 boardings per day or 26.9 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $301,189 in 2016
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 26.9 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.27. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route suburban service in 2014 was 18.3 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $6.78 per boarding.
The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2016 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.
