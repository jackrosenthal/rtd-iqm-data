BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
System-wide Fare Study and Equity Analysis Consultant

Committee Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
November 16, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Four Nines Technologies to facilitate a system-wide fare study and equity analysis for a
total value not to exceed $1,503,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD operates and maintains a high-quality transportation system across the Denver metro region. The
dedicated employees of the agency are committed to delivering service that supports the needs of the
agency’s customers, stakeholders and community members. Fundamental to the sustainability of any
transit agency is the establishment of sound fare policies. RTD’s current fare structure, pass programs
and discount levels were last revised in 2016 and 2019 as a direct result of recommendations from the
last fare study in 2015, followed by a pass program study in 2019. Since the completion of these
studies, RTD has received numerous comments from existing and potential customers, stakeholders, as
well as from the Accountability Committee, that, among other things, fares are too high, the fare
structure is too complex, and the pass programs are overly complicated and have confusing
requirements.
During the April 20, 2021 Board of Directors’ meeting, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO)
communicated that a cross-departmental working group was established in late March with the intent to
provide recommendations that would enable the agency to have a common set of facts and lay the
groundwork for any decisions around fares and fare programs. The April 29, 2021 memo from the
GM/CEO to the Board of Directors outlined the path forward, including conducting a comprehensive
system-wide fare study and equity analysis (study). This will be the first of its kind for RTD as it will
include extensive multicultural outreach leveraging culturally specific community organizations
representing a broad spectrum of the community as well as utilizing a variety of public involvement
approaches.
DISCUSSION
In alignment with the agency’s strategic priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence and
Financial Success as established in the Board-adopted 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, the study will take a
comprehensive look at RTD’s fare structure and pass programs to evaluate opportunities to improve
existing and potential customer access. The outreach to customers, potential customers and
stakeholders will focus on understanding pain points and provide opportunities for feedback on
alternative fare concepts. Trade-offs between alternatives will be clearly articulated with the expectation
that a recommendation will be provided to the Board of Directors for their consideration at the end of
2022.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

A core principle for the study will be to adhere to the Federal Transit Administration Title VI guidance
and RTD’s Title VI program for completing a fare equity analysis associated with any proposed fare
change.
A request for proposals for consultant services to facilitate the conduct of the study was publicly
advertised on September 10, 2021. Four proposals were received on October 18, 2021. The technical
evaluation panel determined that Four Nines Technologies was the most qualified consultant based upon
established criteria. The Four Nines Technologies team had the best combination of relevant technical
experience, a strong public engagement plan, and in-depth knowledge of RTD fares and pass programs.
A Small Business Enterprise (SBE) goal of 15% was set for this contract. Four Nines Technologies has
committed to 20% SBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact will not exceed $1,503,000. Funds to support this study were included in the 2021
Amended Budget previously approved by the Board.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Release Sheridan Parcel from Certificate of Participation

Committee Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
November 16, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the execution of all documents necessary for the release of the
southern portion of the real property located at 1050 N Ames Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”)
from the Certificates of Participation that financed the Property’s acquisition, including execution of any
lease amendments, deeds, and other financial, legal, or zoning documents.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit Oriented Development
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Strategic Plan, this action contributes to RTD’s Strategic Priority of Financial Success by
creating additional sources of funding and improving community perception of financial stewardship
through creating an opportunity for transit-oriented development on RTD land.
As part of the W Line project in the FasTracks plan, RTD originally acquired property for the Sheridan
Station Park-n-Ride (PnR) in 2010 and financed that acquisition with Certificates of Participation (COPs).
These COPs also financed the acquisition of the Wadsworth Station PnR and various trains, buses, and
other assets. In 2020, additional COPs were issued under the 2010 Lease and 2010 Indenture to refund
a portion of the 2010 COPs. The 2010 COPs are currently outstanding in the amount of $100,000,000
and the 2020 COPs are outstanding in the amount of $63,440,000. Currently, the leased Property
consists of 55 light rail vehicles and the Sheridan and Wadsworth stations.
The Sheridan PnR is located on the northern side of the parcel and is accessible via Sheridan Boulevard
to the east and Ames Street to the west. The Property, southwest of the PnR, adjacent to a gas station,
and fronting on 10th Avenue, is vacant and has been the subject of consistent interest from developers
in recent years. Due to the structure of the COPs financing, the Property cannot currently be
developed.
COPs are a lease-purchase financing agreement in which funding is borrowed from investors to purchase
assets with the underlying assets being secured as collateral for the investors. Release of the asset
collateralization may only occur through amendment of the lease-purchase agreement or payment of
principal due to investors.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to release the Property from the COPs, opening the potential for it to be
developed in the future.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

The Property is approximately one half of one acre and has a value of approximately $2,796,000, as
determined by an independent appraisal. This appraised value is approximately 1.71% of the principal
amount of the outstanding 2010 and 2020 COPs. The 2010 Lease and 2010 Indenture may be
amended without the consent of the COP owners if the proposed amendments are necessary or
desirable and do not materially adversely affect the interests of the outstanding COP owners. Bond
counsel will provide an opinion that RTD can amend the 2010 Lease and the 2010 Indenture to release
the Property from the Leased Property. UMB Bank, as trustee, has also determined that this release is
not materially adverse to the COP owners and will consent to the Lease and the Indenture amendments.
Once the Property is released, RTD will follow Lakewood and City and County of Denver guidelines for
designating the Property as a separate parcel, potentially including a site plan amendment, minor
subdivision, and/or new plat. These actions will enable transit-oriented development on the Property,
which could occur in the future either by RTD issuing a request for qualifications or through the
unsolicited proposal procedure for joint development. The Property’s location on the boundary between
Denver and Lakewood as well as at a transit station and a major roadway intersection makes it prime for
development and potentially suitable for affordable housing.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with this action.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2022 Investment Policy
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for approval for the upcoming fiscal year. The
Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
November 2020 for the 2021 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investments of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised
Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the
Strategic Priority of Financial Success.

The Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) 2022 Budget (Budget) represents the expected revenues,
expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal year January 1 through December 31, 2022.
The RTD Board of Directors appropriates funding by fiscal year which allows RTD to continue its mission
to make lives better through connections. The expenditures set forth herein align the Budget with RTD’s
Strategic Plan Priorities within the projected financial constraints.
This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address the agency’s strategic priorities based on
current information. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort in which
the final request to the Board has the concurrence of staff.

Perspective
The impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic had a significant financial impact to RTD beginning in March 2020,
the effects of which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Initial indications were that
annual revenues would decrease by $250 million (25%) from ridership losses and economic austerity
affecting RTD’s fare and sales and use tax revenues. In response, RTD implemented immediate measures
to reduce expenditures and adjust transit activities which had a profound effect on employees, customers
and communities.
During the ensuing months, RTD has revised its financial expectations as a result of improving revenues,
federal relief funding and current economic forecasts. Current information indicates that the financial
impact of the Pandemic has not been as grave as anticipated, albeit financial constraints are expected to
remain.
Prior to the Pandemic much of RTD’s focus was to complete expansion projects. During the Pandemic,
cost reduction efforts required deferral of significant asset management needs. The effect of these
measures has resulted in a substantial backlog of assets combined with service realignment considerations,
both of which will require substantial resource commitments. The near-term fiscal periods will require
RTD to prioritize the aforementioned in order to maintain a reliable transit system.
This Budget request sets a financial course that is prudent and strategic while providing the foundation
for financial sustainability.
The underpinnings of these requested appropriations are to provide a level of service commensurate with
available resources that best meets the needs of RTD customers and communities as well as a focus on
RTD’s fiduciary duty to maintain its assets in a state of good repair. Minimal funding has been identified
for expansionary or new projects.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Revenues
Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time
revenues be used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund
ongoing needs. Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures
require an alternative source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal
operating grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically,
RTD has also been the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief
funding, local contributions and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless
certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Gradual, modest ridership growth is expected to increase fare revenue in 2022 to 79% of preCOVID levels after decreasing to 49% in 2020. Ridership is projected in the Budget to increase
from 70% of pre-COVID levels in January 2022 to 85% by the fourth quarter of 2022. This
projection is based on an analysis and report from Standard and Poor’s which projects a gradual
transit ridership recovery although there is an expectation of a permanent 20% nationwide loss of
ridership due to remote work and emerging competing transportation options.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business
in September 2021. Moody’s economic forecasts assume strong growth resulting from higher
personal income and savings growth occurring during the Pandemic. The Budget contemplates a
$130 million increase from 2019 tax receipts. The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide
expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and
Planning (OSPB).

•

Operating grants from the FTA are a recurring revenue stream to RTD. The grant apportionments
are based upon data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD). The FTA has
agreed to apportion amounts based on prior year NTD submissions excluding COVID-19 impacts
and RTD expects these 5307 preventive maintenance grants to remain steady year-to-year.

•

COVID-19 relief grants are anticipated to provide $101 million in each of years 2022-2024 as RTD
continues to draw down the remaining amounts of the $774 million relief apportionments. This is
one-time funding that replaces tax revenues which, in turn, will be directed towards the asset
management backlog.

Attachment: 2022 Attachment A - 2022 Proposed Budget (4594 : 2022 Proposed Budget)

The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures and
reserves. Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves provide the
financial balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

Other revenue is recurring revenue of $17 million which consists largely of a federal Build America
Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues. No investment income is budgeted
due to the extremely low yields currently being paid.

Expenditures

RTD’s largest expenditure is providing transit-related operations. These costs include compensation,
materials and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities and other such expenses.
RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations
issued to finance the purchase of rolling stock.
Furthermore, RTD has ongoing asset management needs that average approximately $120 million
annually. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as revenue vehicles.
Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:
•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide 85% service levels (see forthcoming headcount
discussion). Financial provisions have been included for collective bargaining and other potential
increases such as recommendations from the classification and compensation analysis as well as
Pay for Performance initiatives.

•

Benefits include the following:
o A $2 million increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit increases
o No increase for non-represented employee health and welfare benefits with Kaiser rates
decreasing slightly and CIGNA premium increases covered by higher employee deductions
per prior Board direction.
o Provision has been made for represented employee pension plan contributions, the terms
of which are to be negotiated with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001. This
pension plan is currently 50% funded.
o An $8.4 million contribution to the non-represented employee pension plan is included
based on the actuarial recommended contribution and unanimous recommendation from
the Trustees of the Salaried Employee Pension Plan. The contribution in 2021 was $6.1
million which was $2 million lower than actuarial recommendations due to financial
constraints. This plan has been closed to new participants since January 1, 2008 and the
$8.4 million contribution covers the additional benefits to be earned in 2022 while also
reducing the unfunded liability. This pension plan is currently 78% funded.
o A 9% contribution to the non-represented employee retirement plan is included. Board
policy is to contribute 7-9% of wages each year. In 2021, the Board reduced the
contribution from 9% in 2020 to 7% due to financial constraints. The increase to 9% in
2022 raises the contributions by approximately $1 million. A 9% contribution is in parity
with the normal cost of the represented pension plan contribution of 8.7% and nonrepresented pension plan normal cost contribution of 9%. The retirement plan Trustees
unanimously recommend a 9% contribution. Only non-represented employees hired
January 1, 2008 and thereafter participate in this retirement plan.

Attachment: 2022 Attachment A - 2022 Proposed Budget (4594 : 2022 Proposed Budget)

Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays
such as debt service and capital expenditures.

1.B.5.b

•

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids and parts. Diesel fuel
purchases have been contracted at $2.30 per gallon giving budget certainty. Fuel and vehicle parts
needs are expected to increase $5 million (10%) in 2022 due to restoration of service.

•

Services consist of contracted specialty IT and legal needs as well as security. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases as well as carry-forward of 2021 projects not yet completed
resulting in a $19.9 million increase in 2022. No new services have been included. $200,000 has
been budgeted for a zero-emission fleet consultant.

•

Insurance costs have decreased over past years due to effective claims management despite the
state increase in government liability caps. The 2022 budgeted costs include the appropriation of
15 months of premiums costs for railroad liability insurance for commuter rail in order to establish
a calendar year policy term that previously expired in September 2021. Insurance costs will remain
relatively flat vs. prior years despite the additional costs associated with opening the N Line.

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses.

Cybersecurity needs have been addressed with a $3.7 million budget
RTD website replacement has been budgeted at $1 million to create adaptation to a digital
platform as well as to restructure, modernize and facilitate improved transparency
Travel budgets have been eliminated from departmental budgets with a $250,000
placeholder available if travel restrictions are lifted. Expenses for each Director have been
budgeted at $3,000 per individual to allow for local travel
Funding employee development training has been budgeted at $300,000
Funding for an on-call contract of $1 million is included to address specialty consulting
engagements, if necessary
A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited.

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists
of principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2022 will total $235.2 million. The Base System bond
payments will expire in 2024, at which point, the Base System will be subject to the Taxpayer Bill
of Rights (TABOR) restrictions. The debt service has been structured such that the Base System
will subsidize FasTracks in 2025 and beyond. RTD’s outstanding debt is $3.2 billion as of October
2021.
