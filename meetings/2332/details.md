#### 1. Real Property Policy Update

Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development, reviewed the Real Property Policy Update presentation included in the Planning and Development Committee agenda packet for August 4, 2015.  She noted that the intent of the presentation is to gather feedback from the Board before writing an updated policy.  The presentation covered the following areas:

- Current RTD Policies Governing Real Property

- Proposed Resolution

- Proposed Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Excess Property

- Proposed Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Joint Development or Acquisition of Excess Property

- Proposed Unsolicited Proposal Review Process

- Proposed Excess Property Review Process

- Proposed Joint Development Proposal Review Process

- Proposed Sole Source Criteria Justification for Joint Development Proposals

- Proposed Submission and Evaluation Criteria for Joint Development Proposals

- Next Steps

During the Proposed Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Excess Property discussion, Kate Iverson noted that among the exceptions requiring Board approval were:

- The dedications of Right of Way (ROW) to local jurisdictions

- The grants of property interest with a fair market value under the General Manager’s delegated contracting authority, which currently is $1 million per Resolution 19, series of 2007

- Non-permanent grants of property interest (for example, licenses, temporary constructions easements, short-term leases).

Director Menten asked for some examples of grants of property interests.  She felt that the $1 million General Manager’s delegated contracting authority is a considerable amount of money to give up Board approval.  Kate Iverson pointed out that she could not answer this question on the excess property side; however, under the Joint Development policy, for example, these are surface parking lots that could be converted into a structure parking lot and development.  She noted that the land value for most of these properties is over $1 million and that the number was chosen because it is an existing contractual authority.  She said that staff could refine that number.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, gave the example of Denver Union Station and Ft. Lupton, where RTD leased the property.  She added that the Board has given this level of approval for all the corridors.  Director Menten asked about the timeline of the Real Property Policy for Board approval.  Kate Iverson said that staff would like to have a proposed recommended action by September or October.

Director Lubow wondered if any specifics could be added to the policy for items that would fall under the $1 million level that may have some political sensitivity.  She mentioned fracking as an example.  Kate Iverson replied that she would hesitate at naming specific instances in policy.  She noted that the current practice when a sensitive matter arises is to reach out to the Director of the specific District and update the Board.  Marla Lien reiterated that these types of grants of property interests are all for the benefit of RTD.  For example, RTD might enter an agreement with Xcel Energy because RTD needs power in our area. She noted that easements to somebody else do not fall under this category.  Director Lubow said this was not clear to her from the presentation.  Marla Lien added that maybe when writing the policy the phrase “benefitting RTD” should be “benefitting RTD’s property”.

Director Lubow asked if $1 million or less would always be a remnant of a property since it is the amount delegated to the General Manager.  Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, used the example of the remnants of a Park-n-Ride that was sold to the contiguous car dealership for $1.2 million as frame of reference.  He added that there could be smaller pieces of land valued under $1 million that may not be remnants.  Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property, noted that the majority of easements and small remnants RTD owns are of very low value and that anything of interest would be over $1 million.  Kate Iverson pointed out that staff could find another number that would be more comfortable for the Board while still having the flexibility to not bring every $20,000 action for approval.  Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities, told the Board that staff could bring examples of transactions that have been done in order to get a general sense of size and cost, among other variables.  Susan Altes added that the type of transaction (easement, disposition) would be included.

Director Francone asked for clarification on the General Manager’s authority when it comes to dedications of Right of Way to local jurisdictions.  Kate Iverson replied that the General Manager does have delegation under the authorization of an existing infrastructure line.  She pointed out that the resolutions are silent when it comes to the redevelopment we are seeing around the stations and how the public could access them, since most of the stations are in industrial areas.  Marla Lien noted that the Board has given the General Manager blanket authority for disposal dedications and easement for all the rail lines: West, East, North Metro, Northwest, I-225, and Southeast Extension.  The one that is currently being discussed will mostly apply to Park-n-Rides.  Director Francone wondered if the General Manager had a dollar amount authority.  Marla Lien clarified that the General Manager has authority up to $250,000 for other property, not the corridors.  Director Francone noted that she had issues with these items.

Director Walker asked if the General Manager’s authority to approve grants of property interest could also include access and utility easements.  Marla Lien replied that was correct; however, one was capped by dollars and the other by types of easement.  The General Manager could award these grants if it were to benefit RTD.  Director Walker said that these types of permissions were very similar to the ones he interfaces with on his day job at Xcel Energy.  He understands and agrees with the authorizations as presented.

Committee Vice-Chair Folska asked for confirmation that the actual number that the General Manager or his designee has for authorization is $250,000.  Kate Iverson confirmed that the number is limited to leases, not easements or dispositions of property.

Committee Vice-Chair Folska wondered if staff could sell parking spaces from a Park-n-Ride valued at less than $1 million without the Board taking any action.  Marla Lien said this scenario was possible depending if it is not part of a Federal interest or an Environmental Impact Study (EIS).  Bill Sirois added that it depended if it was a joint development or an unsolicited proposal as the process for each one is different.  David Genova, Interim General Manager, pointed out that just because it is under the authority of the General Manager does not mean that it will not be communicated to the Board.  He suggested adding a notification mechanism to the resolution language.

Committee Vice-Chair Folska asked when RTD could utilize sole source for Joint Development proposals.  Kate Iverson replied that the buyer needs to show that they are the only ones that can do what they are proposing to do, the parcel has no ability for a stand-alone development and they must own property contiguous to RTD property.

Director James suggested adding to the flow chart referred to during the presentation further information about the options available at each decision point.  He recognized this may get a little too much into the weeds.

Director Lubow expressed that she did not understand why RTD would use sole source at all when all projects could be competed.  Kate Iverson replied that staff has made the specifications for sole source very narrow on purpose.  Marla Lien mentioned the Federal Center Station on the West line and the Lincoln Station on the Southeast line as examples of sole source.  She noted that on the Federal Center Station RTD worked closely with St. Anthony’s Hospital on the property for items like joint roads, upsized water and sewer lines, etc. that would not have worked with any other entity.  She said that similar work happened at the Lincoln station where RTD and the adjacent owners put in roads and a shared parking garage with condo arrangements as well as wet and dry utilities.  Director Lubow appreciated the details.  She expressed her concern that some developers would be given preference, thus limiting competition.  Marla Lien said that preference would be given to those adjacent to RTD property in a sole source situation.  She reinforced that in order to execute the contract RTD would have to benefit.  David Genova explained that sole source is not the preferred method of business, competition is; however, there are instances where it is appropriate.  Kate Iverson added that staff would like to be more streamlined.

Director Francone asked if the terms “adjacent” and “contiguous” were being used interchangeably.  Kate Iverson clarified that the correct term should be “contiguous” as it implies that the property touches RTD property.  Director Francone noted that adjacent has a different meaning to contiguous.  She believes contiguous makes sense for this discussion, adjacent does not.

Director Walker pointed out that property lines are what matter in the conversation of contiguous property.  He noted that in some state counties the contiguous property may be across the road.  He found it important to highlight in the discussion that these exchanges are for the benefit of RTD and that the agency would not find itself burdened.  He used the analogy of neighbors where neither one could build a garden independently but together they could in order to clarify the use of sole source.

Director Francone expressed her thanks to staff for all the clarifications and all their work.

#### 2. Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Update

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Communities reviewed the Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Update presentation included in the Planning & Development Committee agenda packet for August 4, 2015.  The presentation included an update on the Civic Center Transit District Plan, Title VI Equity Analyses, the Welton Corridor Pilot, the Yale Station, the Alameda Pilot Station, the Olde Town Transit Hub, Boulder Junction at Depot Square, and Station Area Master Plans with an emphasis on the I-25/Broadway Station Area Plan.

Director James thought that the update was a good outline of everything that is going on.

Director Francone passed on comments from one of her constituents regarding the Civic Center Transit District plan.  She said the constituent was concerned that the station will be under construction during winter as it would make commuting even more difficult.  Director Francone asked regarding plans for the Mineral Station, which is not in her District but she utilizes almost daily.  Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, said that construction on the Civic Center Transit District Plan was slated to start in January.  The construction company recommended starting construction in the spring of 2016 instead of January so construction would happen through one winter cycle instead of two.  Bill Sirois added that the City of Littleton just selected a consultant for the Mineral Station and he would keep the Board updated of the progress.

Director Walker mentioned that he has attended various meetings on the I-25 and Broadway Station Area plan.  He is glad to see citizen participation.

#### 3. Northwest Area Mobility Study Update (No Attachment)

Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, gave an overview of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS).  He said NAMS started two and a half years ago and that it included 5 components:

- Determine if the Northwest rail could be built in segments

- Determine the feasibility of a cost effective way to reach Longmont via North Metro

- Determine if some key corridors could benefit from Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)

- Determine what would be needed to complete the US-36 BRT

- Evaluate options for reverse commute/HOV lanes on I-25

Chris Quinn reminded the Board that in June, 2014 they approved Resolution 6 accepting the consensus statement of the NAMS stakeholders.  The consensus had 5 components.  Chris Quinn continued by listing all the components followed by an update from staff:

- Complete US-36 BRT – RTD is very close to opening US-36 BRT.  There are 3 principal elements that the stakeholders believe necessary that will not be available on opening day: expansion of the Broomfield Park-n-Ride, improvement to the pedestrian bridge across the freeway at the Westminster station, and moving the Church Ranch station platform closer to the parking lot.  RTD is working with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) on the Church Ranch station.

- Establishing arterial BRT in the Northwest area utilizing CO-119 from Boulder to Longmont as the preferred corridor – RTD received a Transportation Improvement Grant (TIP) from the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) of $1 million towards the completion of the environmental analysis for this project.  The hope is to begin the environmental impact study, a 2 year process, early next year and be ready to build by completion of study assuming there will be funding available.

- Stakeholders’ concern on the reverse commute along I-25 – RTD is working with CDOT to put out a scope of work.  RTD hopes to put together a feasibility/analysis study in collaboration with CDOT on this issue if grant money is available.

- Completion of Northwest rail line beyond Westminster – Stakeholders recognize that this will not be built tomorrow but ask that it remains in the forefront for RTD.  Stakeholders requested annual updates.  RTD is in the process of creating this year’s update.  RTD is checking in on an annual basis with BNSF, whose position has not changed so far.  RTD was actually informed that freight activity in the corridor has increased.

Chris Quinn mentioned that TIP funding was awarded to a coalition established to determine if BRT would be an option for Highway 7. He noted that a discussion is beginning on a coalition to study the possibility of BRT on US-287 from Longmont to US-36.

Director Menten asked about the sloped sidewalks at the Westminster station and who would be responsible for the cost.  Chris Quinn replied that stakeholders requested an elevator and stairway instead of the current ramp.  He added that RTD accepted responsibility.  US-36 is the only FasTracks corridor where RTD established a budget instead of a scope of work.  He pointed out this was one of the items that would not be finished before the US-36 BRT opening.

Director Tobiassen mentioned that he read in The Daily Camera about 2 anti-growth ballot initiatives for the November, 2015 elections in Boulder.  He wondered what that may do for the future needs to expand if growth is slowed in the area.  Chris Quinn noted that Boulder is the highest ridership point for US-36, then Westminster.  He said it would be hard to comment on this issue yet but he reminded the Directors that Boulder has always had tight growth control.  Director Tobiassen said that these initiatives will be interesting to follow.

Director James said that Director Tobiassen’s comments reminded him of Boulder’s Danish Plan, which aimed to manage growth from 1976 until 1995.  He believed this ordinance may have dealt with growth outside of Boulder.

#### 4. Sponsorship Naming Rights Program Update

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, introduced Adrian Mabry, Project and Contract Manager for Marketing.  Together they reviewed the RTD Sponsorship and Naming Rights Program Update presentation included in the Planning & Development Committee agenda packet for August 4, 2015. The presentation included a review of the Naming Rights Program divided into two phases:

- Phase I – Research and Valuation Phase; completed in July 2013

- Phase II – Implementation of Marketing Plan and Program; ongoing.

Director Archuleta asked what the estimated sale price for naming rights might be.  Scott Reed replied that the range could include as much as a whole rail line for $1 million a year down to specific stops, which would be considerably less.  He noted that once one of the bigger rail lines naming rights get sold we could see more people with offers.
