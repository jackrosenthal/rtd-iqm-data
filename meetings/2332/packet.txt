Proposed Resolution - Overview
Repeal and replace Resolution 10 (1984) and Resolution 35 (2002)
in their entirety;
Replace Section 3.4.2, Joint Development Proposal Process of
Resolution 17 (2010), Strategic Plan for TOD
Pass a new resolution that adopts individual policies and allows
those to be updated separately:
•
•
•
•

The District’s property interests have expanded and become more integral to
its services and mission;
Much of the District’s real property has a “federal interest” in it;
Need updated policies to provide additional capability to manage a variety of
uses and dispositions efficiently and effectively;
Need flexibility to follow the federal requirements for managing those
properties as those federal requirements are updated over time.

Two new policies:
•
•

Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Excess Property
Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Joint Development or Acquisition of Excess
Property

Packet Pg. 7
