BACKGROUND
The Audit Committee requested that RubinBrown/Internal Audit engage with Finance Department staff
to review RTD’s capital budgeting process and reporting in order to identify any opportunities for
enhancements based on Board recommendations from the November 2023 approval of the 2024
Proposed Budget.
Board recommendations included requests to provide additional explanatory information in the budget
reporting package regarding project details, the status of the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan and
additional narrative information regarding budget line items.
DISCUSSION
Staff agreed with the Board’s recommendations for enhancements to the budget reporting and
appropriation approval process. Staff is currently developing proposed enhancements for Board
consideration and input during spring 2024 to receive feedback and concurrence prior to presenting the
2025 Proposed Budget as a Discussion Item in October 2024 and an action item for budget
appropriation in November 2024. Staff anticipates beginning discussions regarding these enhancements
commencing with the April 16, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting.
Staff has engaged with RubinBrown/Internal Audit to review the recommendations for enhancements
and for RubinBrown/Internal Audit to evaluate the 2024 Proposed Budget information for best practices
in accordance with standards provided by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) in
relation to their peer review process and Distinguished Budget Presentation Awards Program.
