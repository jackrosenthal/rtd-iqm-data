### B. CAC Update

David Lewis stated that on February 20th the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) had a monthly working session at Civic Center with an update from the Government Affairs staff.  They also held a CAC briefing for the new directors; he thanked Directors Anderson, Lubow and Solano for attending.  On February 26 they had an Advance (Retreat) to focus on how to be an asset to the Board and staff in communicating with the community and collecting feedback on the build out of FasTracks.  They have established one-on-one meetings with the Board members to help make personal connections and understand their priorities and interests for their districts.  The quarterly community outreach meetings for the year have been scheduled in order to provide more advance notice.  The CAC members are reaching out to their networks in those communities.  David Lewis encouraged the Board members to participate in these meetings as it adds credibility, the community feels they are being heard, and the CAC acts as a conduit for the communication.  He will provide the dates to the Board office.

Director Bagley stated that he was part of the selection committee for the CAC.  He complimented the CAC for the activities they have undertaken.  He believes it is critical for the Board members to go out of their districts and attend the CAC meetings.  He indicated that the discussions held by the CAC and information they provide to the Board is often different than the Board expects.  He also stated that the next CAC meeting will be in Highlands Ranch on March 20th.  It is important for other members to come to that meeting.  He thanked the CAC for what they do as they are an extension of the Board.

Director Tobiassen thanked David Lewis for the presentation.  He also supported Director Bagley’s statement on the importance of what the CAC does and supported Directors attending the meetings.

Director Hoy thanked David Lewis for the presentation.

#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee

#### 1. 2013 - 004 : Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Walker recused himself due to a conflict of interest.

Rick Clarke stated that in September the Board approved the acquisition of the majority of properties needed for this project.  As the final design progressed, they have identified additional smaller parcels that are required.  This proposal is for four additional parcels; two of them are for the traction power substations which often can be moved around, this is why they were not included in the original packet.  The other two parcels are sliver parcels for sidewalks identified as detailed design of the bridge over Mississippi progressed.

John Shonsey, Chief Engineer, provided a background of the process used for property acquisition.  The process normally begins in the environmental stage where the alignment and properties impacted are identified.  During the design the parcels required and size of each are identified.  The Uniform Property Acquisition Act passed by Congress in 1970 and amended in 1987, which provides consistency independently of the location of the property, is always followed by RTD.  Once the properties have been identified, staff sends a letter of intent to the owners.  The next step is to move to the appraisal phase to identify the fair market value.  If the property exceeds $5,000 the owner has the ability to get his own appraisal which RTD will pay for.  RTD will make an offer to the property owner based on the established fair market value.  If the owner rejects the offer, RTD moves into condemnation proceedings.  Even once the condemnation proceedings have begun, RTD continues negotiations with the owner.  Along with the condemnation proceedings, RTD goes into an immediate possession hearing for the property in order to allow RTD to begin construction.  RTD only acquires properties that are needed for transit use or purpose.  If we go to court, the fair market value is determined by the court.

Director Lasater asked if staff knows how many times we have not been able to negotiate and used eminent domain.  John Shonsey stated that the West Corridor is a good example, RTD acquired almost 100 properties and only 3% went through the condemnation process.  The goal is to not go to court but agree in the fair market value.  Director Lasater asked if there is a common thread as why we do not get a closure in the negotiation.  John Shonsey stated that in most cases it is due to a significant difference in the appraisal value and we cannot reach an agreement.  Sometimes the property owner really does not want to sell the property and we have to go to court for the project to continue.  Rick Clarke stated that most of the time it is because of the difference in appraisal value.  Also, sometimes the properties are large commercial properties which have a unique purpose and can get complicated.

Director Lubow stated that she was concerned about the resolution stating that “the designee has the authority to amend, including enlarging the legal description of the properties”; this statement leaves the Board approval vague.  She wanted to know if this is only for the minor changes.  Marla Lien stated that the only way RTD can take properties is for a transit purpose.  As design goes from 30 to 100 percent requirements might change.  Sometimes it is just right-of-way and sometimes the owner requests RTD take more property.  John Shonsey stated that it works both ways, as property owner may also request that RTD change the design to avoid taking part or the whole property.  Director Lubow asked if this clause has made any significant difference in what property is acquired versus what the Board approved. Marla Lien stated that it only affects the size of the property; to buy any additional properties staff would have to come back to the Board.  Rick Clarke stated that if staff has to come back to the Board for every minor change it would use up a great deal of staff’s time.

Director Sisk asked why we cannot work an agreement with the public service company for the amount of property required.  Marla Lien stated that the eminent domain starts when we tell the property owner that RTD has the legal authority to take that property even if they do not want to sell.   Under the Uniform Act RTD is required to establish our authority.  Unless we disavow ourselves in writing of the right to take the property, it is under eminent domain law and we have to comply with the process even if it is public services.  The likelihood of this going to court is minimal.  Director Sisk stated that his concern is that when these issues go to court it is bad public relations for the agency as well as the city and the county as these are our customers.  This is a very expensive process.  He requested an analysis and lessons learned on how we can avoid condemnation, even though he understands the letter has to be sent out.  John Shonsey stated that they will provide the information.

Rick Clarke stated that staff works hard to try to avoid having to go to trial; however, there was a case that went to trial because the other party was asking for $5 million and we were offering less than $1 million.  Director Sisk stated that when making that decision we should put into consideration the fact that we will have to pay attorney fees  and other cost to move forward with the court proceeding.   John Shonsey stated that RTD is confined the Uniform Act and the fact that in many cases we have federal funds involved.  When we use federal funds we have to justify the value and need concurrence from the federal government in order to proceed with the fair market value which is established through the different appraisals.  If there is a difference in the appraisals staff will try to negotiate but staff still has to have the documentation in order to support the case.  We use Uniform Act to make sure that everybody is treated the same.  Marla Lien stated that in non-federal projects there is an appraiser, review appraiser and for properties above $250,000 they need to be reviewed by the Federal Government to approve the settlement.  GM Phil Washington stated that staff does everything possible to avoid the courts and spend an incredible amount of time on disputed acquisitions.  Staff always talks about the possibilities and settlement options.

Director Solano asked what happens when we are taking land from a business that will then need to close.  John Shonsey stated that whether it is a business or a family, RTD would provide relocation assistance and try to help them find a location that is suitable because economically it is more viable for them to stay within the same community.  Staff works with cities and communities through their economic development staff.  RTD provides assistance and takes everything into account.  This is included in the evaluation of the property.   Director Hoy asked if any of the properties in this request will have that kind of impact.  John Shonsey stated that none of these acquisitions will have to relocate anybody.   Director Hoy requested for this discussion to continue offline.

Director Tobiassen stated that this process is the back end of a very long process that started years ago with the environmental study.   RTD has hosted several public meeting and outreach to many of the property owners in the corridor; these owners are already aware that this would happen.  Many of the property owners have been present at the Board meetings; this is a win-win for anybody in the corridor.

Director Menten asked if they have used any appraisers from out of state for I-225.  John Shonsey stated that he is not aware of any appraisers from out of state.  Appraisers have been hired by the contractor.  If the property owner wants an appraisal, it is up to him to determine who the appraiser will be, but normally they will pick a local appraiser.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED to the Recommended Action.

Director Hoy recognized John Shonsey who is retiring from RTD.  Rick Clark stated that they will miss John as he has been instrumental in developing FasTracks and making sure it is moving successfully.  He will be working until the end of March; they will have a happy hour on Thursday the 14th.

#### 2. Recommendation for Contract Awards to Krische, Gilmore, ITP and Sky Blue for On-Call Construction Services

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award contracts to Krische Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, ITP Construction Services, Inc., and Sky Blue Builders, LLC, the four most qualified firms based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount up to $40 million for On-Call Construction Services.  The work in these contracts will consist of general civil construction including grading, drainage, utilities, paving, intersection improvements, site work and landscaping.  Funding for these contracts will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rick Clarke stated that with a program as large as FasTracks, there is often a need for contractors to do miscellaneous construction work.  This is usually work that does not fall within the prime contract and it is more cost-effective to do it separately.  In the past, they have had good experiences with On-Call construction services.  The staff in Capital Programs and the Civil Rights Division work together to structure this contract in order to allow small and mid-size contractors to work on FasTracks.  They did a best-value selection which includes both price and technical capability.  Staff selected four contractors for the job in this request.    He recognized the representatives from the different contractors present at the meeting.

GM Phil Washington stated that each of these contractors have agreed to hire WIN participants in their projects.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED to the Unanimous Consent agenda.

#### 1. Eagle Update

Rick Clarke introduced the Eagle P3 team, which includes Brian Middleton, Project Director; Greg Straight the Design-Build Manager and Ashland Vaughn, Construction Manager.  Other team members were also in the audience.

They presented a video on the progress of Eagle P3.

Greg Straight stated that the Eagle P3 Project includes the East Rail Line which offers 34-minute travel time to DIA; the Gold Line which offers 25-minute travel time to Ward Road and the Northwest Rail Westminster Segment which offers 11-minute travel time to Westminster.  This also includes the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF).  He reviewed the historical milestones which include the groundbreaking for each for each of the corridors which are now underway.

The presentation included the project scope, the financial breakdown for the $2.2 million and major changes that have occurred. The contractor has done a great job in developing the final design.  They have been working with the communities to identify different interest/requirements that enhance the project and the community.   One of the changes was the Aviation Station, which has not cleared at the federal level but is expected to move forward.  This will be the year when they change the landscape of the Denver Community as intersections will change, bridges will be built, and the rail will be put down.   They are still on track for opening in 2016.

Ashland Vaughn stated that at this point there are 21 bridges under construction with close to 26 miles of track construction and 70% of rail welding completed.  Our partners have done a fantastic job and minimized the obstruction to the public and worked hard on public outreach.  He provided a summary of the situation in each of the corridors and the CRMF.

Greg Straight stated that the vehicles are being built specifically for the project.  Staff has worked with the community on the vehicle design, primarily with constituents with special needs to get their feedback.  These modifications have been incorporated to address their requests.  The final production will be done in Philadelphia. The presentation also included the rolling stock and systems progress.

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager for Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Planning Coordination, provide update on developments at 38th and Blake where the Urban Land Conservancy is doing a project.  The Olde Town Arvada Station is included in the pilot program.  In December the Board had discussed putting out a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), jointly with the City of Arvada and Arvada Urban Renewal Authority (AURA).  The RFQ came out on March1, 2013 for a master developer to identify how to incorporate the station with the community in that area.  They have received an unsolicited proposal for the Arvada Ridge Station and expect to have a decision soon on whether or not to accept that proposal.

Ashland Vaughn stated that they have over 350 people in the WIN program and 73 of them have been placed.  60 of them are at RTD and FasTracks with 93% of them retaining their jobs after 90 days with an average starting salary of $16.75.

Director Folska asked if the video is available on the website.   Greg stated that it is not available yet as this is the first time it has been shown but it will be posted tomorrow.  Director Folska asked if they will write a white paper on safety.  Rick Clarke stated that they are updating the design criteria for crossings and have put together a taskforce to develop lessons learned from the different corridors.   As far of the white paper, they might write a technical paper to share with APTA with regard to the challenges and how they were addressed.  Director Folska asked for clarification of what happened on March 1st.  Bill Sirois stated an RFP was sent out and we expect to have it back by April.  Once we receive it, they will solicit an RFP.  Director Folska asked for clarification on the difference between an RFP and RFQ.  Bill Sirois stated that the RFQ is a Request for Qualifications, which identifies qualifications to be a master developer.  Once those are received they create the RFP which includes a more detailed and conceptual level plan on how they would incorporate RTD’s facilities into a development in/or around the station.  Director Folska asked if the developers are local.  Bill stated that it is being advertised both locally and around the country.

Director Tobiassen thanked the Eagle team for the presentation.  He thanked them especially for the work they have done in protecting Colorado wild life in the corridors.  It is very difficult.  He also recognized the PI team.

Director Lubow seconded Director Tobiassen’s comments and thanked the staff for their efforts.  She asked about the developer withdrawing the proposal for TOD in Arvada for the parking structure.  Bill Sirois stated that the developer was depending on city funding it did not receive.  He is still evaluating and staff is meeting internally to make a final evaluation.  Director Lubow asked if that means that if the proposal is withdrawn then RTD would have the regular proposed parking.  Bill Sirois stated that is correct.

Director Rivera-Malpiede also congratulated the team for an awesome job.  They have been on call 24/7 and she thanked them for their efforts and for coming to the communities to answer questions.  She is proud to have a facility that will be LEED certified.  This will be a major cornerstone for the communities.  The WIN facts are impressive.  She is proud to be on this Committee.

Director Menten asked if RTD will be paying the developer that is withdrawing because they did not get the money form Arvada.  Bill Sirois stated that it was defined that RTD would not bring any additional money to the table; the money that is already allocated will be the money used to help build the garage.  Director Menten asked who will profit if the legislation passes and Arvada comes back in.  Bill Sirois stated that the entire intent with the parking bill in this particular instance is to provide a revenue source to fund the gap to build parking, without funding it would not be possible.  The revenue would be used to pay for the parking structure.  Director Menten asked if the developer would function only as the developer and not operator of the parking facility.  Bill Sirois stated that if we were to accept the unsolicited proposal, which has not been decided yet, all the details would be subject to negotiation; staff would come back to the Board for approval.

Director Daly asked if they can still run in the same strength by using surplus rail from the West Corridor which is light rail and shifting into commuter rail.  Greg Straight stated that they absolutely can because it is all 115 pound rails.

Director Anderson thanked the staff for all the hard work they have done on the Eagle P3 project.  Though she appreciates their efforts to save wildlife, she is very pleased with the way that staff has work with the cities of Arvada and Denver and all the places close to the railroad tracks.   Staff spent hours working with the neighborhoods and she appreciates the fabulous work they have done.  It makes her job easy.  This is the culmination of all the years of work since 2010 when they first started the Eagle P3 project.  As part of the TOD projects it is great to have cooperation between RTD and the city of Arvada.  It is impressive the densities that have been built in property that was polluted and the developer has cleaned up.

Director Folska asked for the name of the developer with the unsolicited proposal and how much parking they would construct.   Bill Sirois stated that the developer is Paragon Development.  For Arvada Ridge they are contemplating 210 spaces.  Director Folska asked what demand is anticipated.  Bill Sirois stated that it is a 30 year demand; they are building with the idea that it will last for 30 years.

Director Hoy thanked them for the presentation.   He is excited that the communities will finally be able to see what we are doing.
