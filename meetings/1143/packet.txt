Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

General

Board Meeting Date: March 5, 2013

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Comittee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project.
Property needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition
process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court
proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property
identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or construction
activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 18, 2012 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for the I-225 project. As
detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, these additional acquisitions have
been identified.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the I-225 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not pass the attached resolution. Failure to pass the
attached resolution may result in project delay.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
I-225 SEGMENT 2 LIGHT RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed that attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list the
property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation to
acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate condemnation
proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the authority to
amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it deems necessary in the
best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the power of
eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a significant personal
sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that there is
a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in furtherance of a
public purpose, and that the additional acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and
safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for the acquisition of
the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any property through good faith negotiations, then
the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property owners,
to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of owners to the
maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties as soon
as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2013.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 28, 2013

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Board Meeting Date: March 5, 2013

Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Awards to
Krische, Gilmore, ITP and Sky Blue for On-Call
Construction Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to award contracts to Krische Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, ITP
Construction Services, Inc., and Sky Blue Builders, LLC, the four most qualified firms based on the
application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount up to $40 million for On-Call Construction Services.
The work in these contracts will consist of general civil construction including grading, drainage, utilities,
paving, intersection improvements, site work and landscaping. Funding for these contracts will be
included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
BACKGROUND
RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform civil and structural work on various projects for
the base system. As RTD’s rail system has grown and with the complexity and size of FasTracks, the
need has arisen for an on-call construction services contract for the base and FasTracks Projects.
Four firms were selected to deliver the work. One firm was selected for the value of the work to be
performed in the price range of $0 to $500,000 and three other firms were selected for the value of the
work to be performed in the price range of $0 to $2,000,000. The selection committee originally
planned on selecting two contractors for each price range, but upon review, it was deemed that only
one of the three proposers in the $0 to $500,000 price range would have the capability and capacity to
perform the work. Therefore, three contractors were selected in the price range of $0 to $2,000,000 to
end up with a total of four.
One contractor will be chosen for each work order, based on the value of the work order and capacity of
the contractor to complete the work. It is the intent of RTD to distribute work orders on a rotational
basis factoring in: work order amount, contractor (prime and sub) capacity and availability to do the
work, and cost and price agreement. RTD intends to distribute work orders on an equitable cost basis
among the four contractors.
RTD will evaluate, at its sole discretion, the capabilities of the submitter to effectively deliver the work.
The goal of this solicitation is as follows:






Provide finished products that meet RTD’s overall needs, including its Small and Disadvantaged
Business Commitment participation goals and demonstrate a substantive commitment to RTD’s
Memorandum of Understanding with its stakeholder constituents as approved by RTD.
Meet the schedules established in the work orders.
Provide a safe and quality product.
Maximize improvements within the program budget.
Minimize inconvenience to the public.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract awards are included in the existing budgets of RTD FasTracks Projects. Work
performed under these contracts will be assigned on a work order basis, and paid for by the project that
assigned the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award contracts to Krische
Construction, Gilmore Construction Corporation, ITP Construction Services, Inc., and Sky Blue
Builders, LLC, the four most qualified firms based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the
amount up to $40 million for On-Call Construction Services. The work in these contracts will consist
of general civil construction including grading, drainage, utilities, paving, intersection improvements,
site work and landscaping. Funding for these contracts will be included in the budgets of the
projects on which the work is performed.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award contracts
to the four firms listed above; the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation
criteria, in the amount of $40 Million. This is not recommended as the evaluation criteria was in
accordance with federal and RTD procurement standards. In addition, the evaluation review process
was extensive, six professionals providing input into the selection to insure that this recommendation
met the Board’s expectations. Furthermore, this alternative would delay the implementation of
several key projects.

Packet Pg. 15

1.C.2

3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the on-call construction services approach. This is not
recommended as experience has shown that an on-call services contract provides the highest quality
at the lowest price for these miscellaneous specialized projects. In addition, it provides immediate
response to any required emergency actions.
