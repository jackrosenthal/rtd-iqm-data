Discussion:               Chair Sisk reviewed the agenda and asked Paula Perdue to share the plans for the special recognition.  Paula indicated that the superintendents of the schools, principals, families and winners are expected to be here.

Paula also commented on the proclamation for Directors Daly and Rivera-Malpiede which the Executive Committee approved.  It is customary for the Chair to read these proclamations at the Board Meeting and allow the retiring Board members a chance to comment along with any other Board member who may want to make a comment.

Chair Sisk thanked Brenden Morgan for providing the explanation and clarity on the investment policy changes.  Paula Perdue stated the reason why the unfinished business item on Investment Policy was there is because it was tabled to a time certainty and brought back to the Board.  Director Walker asked for clarity and stated his understanding this was tabled at a committee meeting which does not apply to the Board meeting.  This item should be a part of the recommended action agenda.  Paula indicated she would research and make the appropriate correction.

The committee would vote subject to this issue being checked and validated.

## V. Other Matters

- Director Bagley reported that he attended the CAC meeting last night in Five Points.  There were six Board members who attended.  Many of the CAC members were there.  This meeting was well received.

- Director Bagley reported that he arrived at the Rio Court event around 3:55 p.m. prior to the closing.  He was the only Board member there.  He recalled the purchase of this property and to see the re-purposing is worth seeing.  This is a large facility which will house not only LRT vehicles but commuter rail vehicles as well.

- Director Bagley referred to the Squire Patton Boggs meeting where they stated the House would be on recess during the APTA Legislative Conference. He suggested the Executive Committee discuss if only a “light “ group of Board members should go and schedule a more robust meeting when the full House is in session.

Director Hoy commented that he agrees in principle and understands the concerns; however, he believes there will be a natural roll down in attendance based on decisions by the respective Board members.  Director Walker asked if it is possible to have an audience here with our full Congressional Representatives.

Director Tobiassen stated that although the House would be in recess, there may be a couple of opportunities to meet with key staff so it would not be a wasted meeting. Another opportunity is when the Accelerate Colorado group goes to Washington.  This is a chance to educate the new representatives.

Chair Sisk shared he was of a mixed mind.  On the one hand, it is unfortunate that the House will be in recess.  On the other hand, he sees this as a positive opportunity to get to know the Board members on a more personal level.  This is a chance to meet Board members from other agencies.  He is not comfortable with a mandate of what others can do with their travel budget.  He thinks this is a good opportunity for the new Board members to go back.  He thinks this should be individual decisions and for the committee to make a call is overreaching in his opinion.

Director Bagley clarified he thought this was a conversation worth having, especially in light of the information that the House would not be in session. He noted that last year we had a very robust meeting.  He was concerned that this year we may not.

Director Folska stated that in addition to meeting the staff, there are other committees outside of our Congressional team that is beneficial to meet (i.e. T&I, Banking Subcommittee, Energy, EPA)

Director Walker reflected that previous travels had not been as good as the one last year. Perhaps we can put it on the next Government Relations Committee to discuss.

General Manager Washington commented that we need to remember that the Conference in itself provides some wonderful speakers and sessions.  APTA plans these conferences years in advance and is reeling from the fact that the House will not be in session.  There are still some good things that can be gotten from this conference.

- Paula Perdue added there are a couple of things the Committee needs to take into consideration about this Legislative conference:  First, reservations are being made now; these reservations fill up fast so a decision needs to be made.  Secondly, it is expected that a few RTD key people will be at this conference-General Manager Washington, the APTA Board member Anderson and Director Walker to push the TBM Conference in Denver in July.  Thirdly, the weekend of the APTA Legislative conference conflicts with the weekend for the joint Board-Staff Strategic Planning advance.  We had discussed moving the strategic planning advance to March 21 but we need to confirm so she can get the 2015 calendar released.  Chair Sisk asked if the last week in February is an option and Paula responded there is no way she can turn this around from the PEST workshop we will have on February 7. After some discussions on possible times, the committee took a vote on which date for the Joint Board-SLT Strategic planning advance:

Motion:                Chair Sisk made the motion to approve March 21 as               the date for the joint Board-SLT strategic planning advance.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Vote on

Motion:               The Committee voted with 4 in favor (Sisk, Hoy, James and Walker) and 1 opposed due to a conflict (Tobiassen)

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

- General Manager Washington shared that the unveiling of the plaque at Rio Court was a success.  This plaque has the RTD Board members names listed on it.  He shared also that the Congressional FY 2015 budget is out and the $150M for the FFGA is on the list. He stated the catchup funds are not on the list. Hopefully, this will be approved this week.

- General Manager Washington reported that the Leadership Academy graduation was today.  There are 29 graduates with families and friends.  The graduation was held at the Oxford Hotel.

- Several of the Committee members reported on the Fare Task Force meeting.  In general, it was well attended and staff did a good job of keeping it focused.  Chair Sisk reported that the Boulder meeting was not well attended, perhaps due to the time of day.  There is a bicycle group there mobilizing who are concerned about the possibility of an increase in fare.

- Director Hoy made a general comment that he had attended an event at the St. Anthony North-North Hospital.  He reflected there has been tremendous growth in the area around 136 North but transit services have not been extended.  He thinks this is phenomenal growth that perhaps RTD needs to get on our radar screen.
