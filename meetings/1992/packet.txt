BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date: November 13, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Date:

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2013. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor in revising the
Policy. Changes being recommended are mainly in response to changes made to Colorado State
Statutes in 2014. Although some adjustments have been incorporated into the recommended Policy,
they do not significantly alter the intent of RTD’s current Policy.
The following table is a summary of the current 2014 Policy parameters compared to the recommended
Policy parameters. Items highlighted in yellow reflect changes being recommended to the Policy. The
Policy remains conservative in nature with the policy objectives remaining, in priority order, safety,
liquidity and yield and would still require stricter diversification limits than required by state statute.

The first recommended change reflected above is to the diversification requirements between issuers of
local government investment pools and money market funds. This change is a preemptive response to
the current money market reform efforts underway by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The reforms being considered by the SEC that have been disclosed to date have the potential to reduce
the number of money market funds that exist today. Increasing the maximum issuer limit in the policy
from 20% to 50% provides RTD with flexibility to invest in a potentially smaller market of money market
and local government investment pools and enhances the ability of staff to manage daily cash
investments.
The second recommended change reflected above is to the maturity restrictions on municipal bonds.
State statute changes have allowed state and local governments the ability to invest in municipal bonds
that mature up to 5 years in the future instead of the previous 3 year limit. This recommended change
will increase the market of municipal bonds available for RTD to purchase. The policy still requires that
the portfolio be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less so a change to the existing
benchmarks is not being recommended at this time. Previously, the only securities that the policy
permitted beyond three years were U.S. Treasuries and Federal Agencies and Instrumentalities so this
third security type adds the ability diversify beyond U.S. Treasuries and Federal Agencies and
Instrumentalities in securities purchases with more than 3 year maturities while still limiting the whole
portfolio’s duration to three years or less.
The third recommended change reflected above is to minimum rating requirements of Federal Agencies
and Instrumentalities. State statute changes have allowed state and local governments the ability to
invest in Federal Agencies and Instrumentalities with ratings as low as AA-. This change in state statute
reflects the reality that many of these securities and issuers have been downgraded in recent years from
AAA to AA even though the securities are often guaranteed by the U.S. government. This Policy
change will increase the market of Federal Agency and Instrumentality securities available for RTD to
purchase.
The other change being recommended to ratings restrictions is reflective of changes made to State
statute which now differentiates between municipal bonds issued by Colorado municipal issuers and
non-Colorado issuers. State statute now allows local governments to invest in Colorado municipal issuer
bonds with a minimum rating of A- in contrast to non-Colorado municipal issuers who still require a

Packet Pg. 6

2.11.A

minimum rating of AA-. This change adds some flexibility to the management of RTD’s portfolio when
appropriate and again will increase the market of municipal bonds available for RTD to purchase.
Although these recommended changes allow for more flexibility in the management of RTD’s investment
portfolio, the Policy remains conservative in nature with the Policy objectives remaining, in priority order,
safety, liquidity and yield and would still require stricter diversification limits than required by state
statute.
Recommended changes are reflected in the attached redline copy of the RTD Investment Policy
Statement. A final version of the policy which includes all of the recommended changes is also
attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement
1. PURPOSE

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

1

Packet Pg. 10

2.11.A.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Formatted: Left

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

2.11.A.a

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

Formatted: Left

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.

Formatted: Left

4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

highest rating category (“AA”) will includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard &
Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an
issuer or security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is
held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will
determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services and it
shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from those authorized institutions and
firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary dealers reporting to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors

the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party

executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Attachment: Investment Policy Markup (2151 : Investment Policy)

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").

This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 27

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

2. SCOPE

2.11.A.b

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 28

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

2.11.A.b

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
3
Packet Pg. 29

Attachment: Investment Policy Final (2151 : Investment Policy)

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.

Date: November 26, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

November 26, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) for OnCall Systems Construction Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the
most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed
$67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services Contractor. The work in this Contract includes
providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction
Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal and Communication System, and Trackwork
construction services. Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget
for current year projects. Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the RTD 2014 goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery and the
2015 goal of Improving Service Delivery. RTD has long employed on-call contractors to perform civil and
structural work on various projects. As RTD’s rail system has grown and with the complexity of
FasTracks, the need has arisen for an on-call systems construction services contract for electrical
systems. This is specialized work that can only be performed by specific contractors and is critical to
supporting Light Rail Operation.
In September 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for construction services for On-Call
Systems Construction work. On October 24, 2014, two written proposals were received:
1. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)
2. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
The six RTD evaluation team members evaluated the written proposals and conducted a preliminary
ranking according to the following evaluation criteria:
A. Management, Organization, Experience and Approach………………..50%
B. Cost……………………………………………………………………………..35%
C. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged
and Small Businesses and WIN Program………………………………….15%
DISCUSSION
The ranking of the two proposals was very close as both firms have extensive experience and a good
track record with RTD. The following is the result of the evaluation by the six member evaluation team:
1. Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
2. Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc. (BBII)

Packet Pg. 47

2.12.E

The team concluded that Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC) was the recommended best value
contractor based on the following criteria:
A. Team Resources – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC)
demonstrated the ability to perform under the RFP, has the ability to fully support and provide
the necessary staff and equipment to fully implement the Scope of Work.
B. Project Management Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric Construction
Company (MEC) provided a strong project management approach including providing different
options for completing projects identified in the Scope of Work.
C. Schedule Performance and Approach – The evaluation team believe Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC) provided a thorough approach for schedule performance and
completion of projects. They demonstrated their ability, resources and capability to comply
with the Scope of Work.
In addition, Mass. Electric Construction Company’s (MEC) proposed DBE goal exceeded the 16% goal
advertised in the RFP and meets the 8% WIN goal. Therefore, the evaluation team recommends Mass.
Electric Construction Company (MEC) based on best value for RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract award is included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects.
Funding for future year projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Mass. Electric
Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation
criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300 for On-Call Systems Construction Services
Contractor. The work in this Contract includes providing new, retrofit, and emergency construction
services for the Overhead Contact System, Traction Power Systems, Fare Collection Systems, Signal
and Communication System, and Trackwork construction services. Funding for the contract award is
included in the 2015 Adopted Capital Budget for current year projects. Funding for future year
projects will be authorized in future year budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to award a contract
to Mass. Electric Construction Company (MEC), the most qualified firm based on the application of
the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $67,229,300. This action is not recommended
because it will affect the capability to perform necessary State of Good Repair projects in a timely
manner on the current light-rail system. Also, the ability to quickly respond to critical systems
repairs on the light-rail system will be jeopardized.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the systems on-call construction services approach. This is not
recommended as experience has shown that an on-call services contract provides the highest quality
at the lowest price for these miscellaneous specialized projects. In addition, it provides immediate
response to any required emergency actions in the system area.

Approval of On-to-Off and Onboard Passenger
Surveys Consultant Selection

Assistant

Date: November 25, 2014
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for
the completion of an on-to-off and onboard passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed
$1,435,000. Funding is included in the FasTracks 2015 budget.
BACKGROUND
This action supports and fulfills the General Manager Goals of Grow riders and engage customers
across the region because it will collect relevant data for the understanding of RTD passengers; and
Continue advancement of FasTracks because it moves RTD further toward completion of the full
FasTracks Plan.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements
(FFGAs) to complete “Before and After” studies and regularly update travel forecasting models for
the projects receiving grants. On-to-off and onboard passenger surveys collect important data for
understanding the context in which RTD passengers make their travel decisions. The data from these
surveys will be used in the development of the required “Before and After” studies of the West Rail
Line and Eagle project and for travel model updates used to develop RTD ridership forecasts.
DISCUSSION
The Civil Rights Division set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 15% of the contract
value and a Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) requirement of 20% of the personnel. Four teams submitted
proposals. The prime contractors were Dikita, ETC Institute, NuStats, and OGx. The evaluation team
consisted of four RTD staff members and one staff member from the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). ETC Institute is committed to meeting the DBE goal and WIN requirement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project will come from a combination of local FasTracks funds from the West Rail
Line and a mix of federal and local FasTracks funds from the Eagle Project. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to ETC Institute for the completion of an on-to-off and onboard
passenger surveys project for an amount not to exceed $1,435,000. Funding is included in
the FasTracks 2015 budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would violate

After Studies for the West Rail Line and Eagle project.

Approval of 2015 Final Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the 2015 Final Performance Measures proposed recommendations for Goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3.
The final recommendations for these goals are made after the 2015 Budget is adopted in November to
reflect budget estimates.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.
In April 2014, the Board adopted the 2015 performance measures for all goals except 3.1, 6.2, and
6.3. These three goals are finalized after the 2015 Budget is adopted in November because these
goals are contingent upon budgeted amounts and available resources.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes to Goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3 from 2014 to 2015 are listed below:


Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on-time performance (bus)
o No changes are recommended to the bus on-time performance goals in 2015 and they
remain the same as in 2014 as follows:



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o This measure is proposed based on the 2015 Budget and Ridership Goal Model as
adopted by the Board of Directors. The forecast is for ridership to remain flat in 2015.

Packet Pg. 55

2.13.H



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total revenue
o This measure is proposed based on the 2015 Budget as adopted by the Board of
Directors. The decline in fare revenue comes from an estimated decline in West Line
farebox revenues of $1.6 million in 2015 per the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation
and a small decline of $0.325 million in other operating revenue.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
No additional financial impact results from the adoption of these final performance measures apart
from the 2015 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Final Performance Measures to include specific measurements for the three
goals described above.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 4, 2014

From:

Marla Lien, General Counsel
Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

December 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Recommendation for Passage of Resolution
Regarding Defense of RTD Management
Trustees Appointed to RTD/ ATU 1001
Trusts

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached resolution authorizing retention of defense counsel and payment of all defense costs, and
procurement of insurance if available for management trustees appointed to the RTD/ATU 1001 Health
and Welfare and Pension Trusts, without reservation of rights of recovery of such costs regardless of
any determination of liability, to the extent such defense costs are not covered by the trusts or their
insurers.
BACKGROUND
The Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU 1001 provides that RTD will pay
health and welfare and retirement benefits into two separate trusts, the RTD/ATU 1001 Health and
Welfare Trust and the RTD/ATU 1001 Pension Trust, and that each trust will be administered by three
management appointed and three ATU appointed trustees. Therefore, RTD currently has a contractual
obligation to appoint trustees. When acting as trustees, RTD appointees are serving as fiduciaries.
Some case law has indicated that even when appointed by RTD, fiduciaries must act independently and
are not considered to be in the course and scope of their employment when fulfilling their roles as
Trustees. If claims are made against RTD appointed trustees for their acts taken while serving in that
capacity RTD may not be responsible for defending them. The trusts have indemnification provisions and
have insurance, however both the provisions on indemnifying for costs of defense, and the insurance,
exclude claims for certain breaches of fiduciary of duty and willful misconduct. Claims may allege either
or both leaving trustees potentially personally at risk for their defense.
DISCUSSION
For so long as RTD is required to appoint trustees under the CBA, it is in RTD’s best interests to appoint
capable trustees who would not need to refuse the positons out of fear of personal exposure. To the
extent the Trust Agreements and insurance policies do not cover costs of defense it is recommended
that RTD agree to provide defense for RTD appointed trustees regardless of the outcome of the matter,
where such costs are not covered by the Trusts or the Trusts insurers. RTD may procure insurance
coverage for its trustees to the extent such coverage is available and has not been procured by the ATU
trusts. This does not include payment of judgments against any trustee.

Packet Pg. 67

2.13.I

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is unknown. RTD could pay defenses costs only if claims were made against
management trustees, such claims were not covered by the trusts or the trusts insurers, and RTD was
not able to procure insurance for those claims.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing retention of defense counsel and payment of all
defense costs, and procurement of insurance if available for management trustees appointed to the
RTD/ATU 1001 Health and Welfare and Pension Trusts, without reservation of rights of recovery of such
costs regardless of any determination of liability, to the extent such defense costs are not covered by
the trusts or their insurers.
2.
Do not pass the attached resolution and do not agree to provide costs of defense for claims
against management trustees. This may be a disincentive for RTD employees to accept that
appointment.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION No. ___ SERIES OF 2014
RTD/ATU 1001 Pension and Health and Welfare Trusts
Management Trustee Representation
Whereas, RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU) are parties to
a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA); and,
Whereas pursuant to the CBA, RTD and ATU participate jointly in the administration
of two Trusts, a Health and Welfare Trust and a Pension Trust; and,
Whereas, the CBA requires that RTD appoint three management trustees to each of
the two jointly administered trusts; and,
Whereas trustees are fiduciaries to the trusts they oversee and have independent
obligations to those trusts and the trust beneficiaries; and,
Whereas, Colorado law provides for defense of claims against employees acting in
the course and scope of their employment however it is unclear if trustees exercising their
fiduciary duties would be considered as acting in the course and scope of their
employment; and,
Whereas, each of the two trusts has provisions for representation of trustees and
purchase of insurance coverage for claims against trustees however each of the trusts
provides that defense is not available for certain breaches of fiduciary duty, willful
misconduct or lack of good faith; and
Whereas, claims against trustees may allege a variety of matters which may or may
not be proved and the application of standards of conduct and perceptions of courts and
juries are unpredictable; and,
Whereas, RTD employees serving as management trustees on the RTD/ATU 1001
Health and Welfare and Pension Trusts at the request of the district to fulfill district
contractual obligations may be subject to personal exposure and risk based on that service
and it is the desire of the district to, within reasonable limits, protect the employees from
personal exposure and costs; and,
Whereas, for so long as the district is contractually required to designate trustees
the district benefits from having qualified individuals in these roles, who should be well
represented against claims made as a result of their service.

Packet Pg. 69

2.13.I

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
RTD will secure defense counsel, insurance coverage if is available and has not been
procured by the trusts, and pay all costs of defense for RTD appointed management
Trustees appointed to the RTD/ATU Health and Welfare or Pension Trusts, to the extent
such defense cost are not covered by the trusts or the trusts insurers and will pay costs of
defense without right of recovery in the event of any judgment against any or all trustees
for claims not indemnified by or insured against by the trust. RTD shall not be liable for
judgments against any trustee for such claims.
Passed and adopted this ___ day of ___, 2014 by the Board of Directors of the Regional
Transportation District.

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Enhance IT Disaster Recovery Capabilities

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to take all necessary actions and to execute all documents necessary to
partially fund Information Technology’s Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure and systems. This is an
amount of approximately $1.2 million.
BACKGROUND
As a common Information Technology (IT) industry practice, many of RTD’s computer systems and
applications use centralized data storage. In November, a key hardware element on the primary
centralized storage device failed, leaving several of the virtual servers hosted by this device and the
services and applications that they hosted inaccessible. Ultimately it was determined that the failed
components of the original storage device were unrecoverable. IT directed all available resources to the
configuration of secondary storage devices. Over three-days, data and services were restored in order of
priority as communicated by the affected business units. In these three days that included the weekend;
over 900 hours of IT staff time was directed to this recovery and diverted from their regular duties.
The storage device in question did have extensive built-in redundancy to account for potential failures.
As part of our ongoing review and technology roadmap plans, the device was planned to be replaced in
early 2015. The particular component of the device that failed prevented the device from responding to
a disk error, which propagated corrupted data across multiple disks, and led to the full failure of a
section of the device.
No operational data was lost during this event.
 All service and application data that resided on the failed storage device was backed up routinely.
IT was able to restore this data to another storage device.
 Despite the breadth of the outage and the impact to business processes, IT confirmed that critical
security systems, centralized dispatch systems, control systems / SCADA remained operational.
Well prior to this failure, IT actively took steps to document a technology roadmap for standard
maintenance activities including upgrades and replacements. IT further requested funding to support the
roadmap through the Strategic Budgeting Process. There is an additional amount of work required to
bring all of IT’s equipment current and we have been working through a prioritized list to deploy the
necessary maintenance and upgrades given existing staff and resources.
Where our recovery plans for such an event are concerned, our efforts are focused on data recovery and
we are now addressing maintaining seamless continuation of operations. IT regularly prepares data
backups of all of RTD systems so that RTD can reestablish services in the case of a system or storage
failure. Some steps have already been taken regarding disaster recovery, including establishing a
secondary recovery site at the State of Colorado’s EFOR3T facility. A business impact analysis
conducted in 2013 concluded that the first system to be replicated at the disaster recovery site would
be Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD). The CAD elements are presently in acceptance testing.

Packet Pg. 71

2.13.J

Additionally, in 2015, IT is undertaking a cloud services study that will assess the benefits and
drawbacks of hosting email, performing critical system backups, and performing other functions using a
cloud-based third-party service provider. This could eliminate the need for RTD to provide independent
disaster recovery for business systems hosted by the third party if the third party were obligated to
provide the necessary redundancy and disaster recovery features. This will not eliminate the need for
redundancy or disaster recovery in key critical systems that will remain in the RTD-hosted environment.
Ideally, there would be a fully redundant system for critical business processes where failover to a
redundant system would occur when a major outage is experienced. This is a substantial investment and
budget for such a disaster recovery system has yet to be identified. The funds from this proposed action
will be directed towards providing necessary foundational redundancy for critical systems in order of
priority.
DISCUSSION
On November 16, 2012 the Board approved a Staff recommendation to establish the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). A component of the funding sources was identified as the sale or lease of all
RTD properties and it was agreed the funds from these sales and leases would be deposited in the FISA
account. Further there would be no distinction between Base and FasTracks sales or leases. Staff
recognizes the importance of funding the FISA, but due to limited resources and budget constraints
would recommend that the funds from the Alameda and Havana Park ‘n Ride property sale,
approximately $1.2 million, be allocated towards foundational Disaster Recovery hardware addressing
the need for additional servers, storage, firewalls, network connectivity and site backup/restore capacity.
Historically, these types of non-recurring infrequent revenue sources have been used to fund needed one
time projects. This is approximately $926,000 for hardware, initial licensing of $64,000 and an
additional $210,000 for consultant deployment services of an estimate 1,396 hours.
The deployment will require approximately six months to establish the necessary foundational
components, configure, test and move key elements of these critical services into operations.
Subsequently additional less priority applications and systems will be added to the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The development of DR resources is a necessary risk management foundational step and will need to be
accomplished as soon as practical. The sale of the Alameda property will generate approximately $1.2
milIion that could be used for establishing the foundation for the DR facility and procuring necessary
hardware. Future cost for this project could be phased over time dependent of funding availability,
however, with this phasing there is inherent ongoing risks to the organization as well as incremental
increased cost. If approved, the funding for the DR facility $1.2 million will be provided by a budget
transfer from the Unrestricted Fund Balance.
With this DR deployment there will be additional annual licensing expenses to mirror the applications and
services found in the current Data Center. These will be addressed in the annual operating budget.
The financial impacts of not providing the DR could be much larger than this initial investment should
RTD experience multiple outages of systems critical to the business operations.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approval of this action will accelerate this risk mitigation effort and in case of a major failure would provide near
immediate operational recovery of key applications and system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Place the funds from the Alameda land sale in the FISA for future FasTracks construction projects.

3. Instruct IT to continue its regularly scheduled backup and recovery activities and identify funding for the DR in
future budget years.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 2, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Englewood Art Shuttle

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for
an amount not to exceed $282,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the
management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related
expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood.
The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged
a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 688.3 boardings per day or 28.8 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $282,000 in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2014 resulted in 28.8 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.43. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of 34.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an
average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service. The City of Englewood will continue to
pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

Packet Pg. 74

2.13.K

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus
service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.
