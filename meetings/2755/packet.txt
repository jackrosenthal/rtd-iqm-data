G Line Safety Outreach Plan
BACKGROUND:

GOALS:
•

To inform schools, residents, stakeholders and the disabled community along the G Line
about commuter rail safety and provide tips for staying safe around the operation of the
commuter rail and its crossings.
• To provide an opportunity for students to experience rail grade crossings through
crossing mock-up at demonstration events
• To reach out to special interest groups and include them in safety messaging
• To provide real-life demonstrations at an actual crossing when possible and appropriate
for audience

AUDIENCES:
Focus on groups located within a mile radius from the centerline of the trackway.
Events and groups to target include:
• Safety demonstrations- RTD mock crossing
• Safety Days
• Back to school nights, school events
• Neighborhood Meetings
• One-on-one meetings
• School Bus Transportation
• Senior Centers
• Disabled Community, meetings
• Home Owner Associations
• Suicide Prevention Associations and Meetings
KEY MESSAGES:
Stop, Look, and Listen prior to crossing any railroad tracks. Commuter rail trains are quiet
and can approach from both directions.
•

•
•
•

Never play near commuter rail tracks or trains and do not walk on the rail tracks.
Switches on the tracks move automatically and can cause injury. In addition, you would
be breaking the law by trespassing.
Be safe near commuter rail platforms – there is a 4 foot drop from where you board the
train to where the actual tracks are.
Before crossing rail tracks at a road crossing, make sure to use the gate and that the
crossing gates are all the way up, and that there are no flashing lights or bells.
Keep yourself and all objects away from the overhead wires.
11
Packet Pg. 15

Attachment: G-LineCommPlan-Board (3520 : G Line Communications and Events)

Safety is a number one value for the Regional Transportation District. Commuter rail presents a
new technology to the region, making it important to educate communities on the differences
between light rail and commuter rail and how to be safe around the system.

1.C.1.a

•
•
•
•
•

Get off your bike, scooter, or skateboard before you cross the tracks. Wheels can get
caught in the opening next to the track.
When crossing the tracks, PAY ATTENTION – Don’t let your cell phones, headphones,
texting or game playing divert your attention.
Never chase a moving train.
Never play on or around construction equipment.
Always stay in public areas and don’t cross fences or barriers.

NORMAL PATTERN FOR GRAND OPENING ACTIVITIES

Thursday evening VIP Event
Friday Morning Station Opening Ribbon Cuttings, Grand Opening Ceremony and Public
Event
o Free Rides on G Line
Saturday Station Parties [hosted by cities; supported by RTD]
o Free Rides on Rail System

Through prior discussions with Senior Leadership, the events team is aware that lead time for
event preparations will be dramatically shortened. Past events have had up to a year’s worth of
lead time preparation [W Line], and as little as 6 weeks [R Line]. Discussions have centered
around 2-4 week lead times being expected for RTD to notify the public before entering revenue
service on the G Line.
Discussions with G Line stakeholders [Denver, AdCo, Wheat Ridge and Arvada] have indicated
the entities are committed to holding some form of smaller station parties ICW the Grand Opening
Celebrations [Saturday following Opening] rather than delay these for additional prep time.
One additional challenge with this line opening is a venue for the VIP Event. The event team
recognizes there is not a hotel or conveniently located venue adjacent to the G Line [Arvada
Center for Performing Arts is a good venue, albeit, 3-4 miles off the line, requiring bus shuttling].
We are working on setting up a discussion with the City of Arvada to provide access and assistance
with a proposed VIP event to be held on the second level of the Olde Town parking garage [this
provides existing cover and environmental stability with the least amount of modification to the
premises]. We are reaching out to the City this week to initiate this discussion – which we
anticipate going well, as Arvada has clearly indicated it wants to host events related to the Grand
Opening.

G Line Key Messages

•
•
•

•
•
•

2006: RTD FasTracks began a transit-alternatives study that resulted in an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS).
2007: The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) selected the Gold and East Rail lines for
its public-private partnership pilot program, giving birth to the Eagle P3project.
2009: RTD FasTracks released a final EIS; received an FTA Record of Decision, signaling
the completion of the environmental process; and released a request for proposals to
seek a private partner to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the Gold and East
rail lines.
2010: RTD FasTracks selected Denver Transit Partners as its Eagle P3contractor and
concessionaire under a 34-year contract.
2011: Eagle P3 received a $1.03 billion Full Funding Grant Agreement from the FTA, the
largest awarded by the Obama administration; construction began.
DATE , 2018: Line opens to the public as the G Line.

GENERAL
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The G Line is part of RTD’s 2004 voter-approved FasTracks plan to expand transit across
the Denver metro region.
The 11.2-mile electric commuter rail line will connect Denver’s Union Station to Wheat
Ridge, passing through northwest Denver, Adams County and Arvada.
The line will feature seven stations: 41st•Fox, Pecos Junction, Clear Creek • Federal, 60th
& Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike, Olde Town Arvada, Arvada Ridge and Wheat Ridge •
Ward.
It is part of the larger Eagle P3 project, including the University of Colorado A Line and
the first segment of the B Line to Westminster.
Train trips from Union Station to end of line will take 27 minutes (travel times are
approximate.
The line will provide connectivity for commuters between Union Station in downtown
Denver and Wheat Ridge and Arvada.
Ridership is expected to reach 9,000 passenger trips per day on opening day and 12,900
passenger trips per day in 2035.
The trains used on the G Line are commuter rail not light rail. Operated by electricity like
our light rail trains but larger vehicles meant to go longer distances and faster. They
feature storage areas for bags and bike and level boarding. Level boarding trains are
helpful for passengers in wheel chairs and passengers traveling with luggage.

CHALLENGES
•

The EAGLE P3 Project is a $2.2 billion Project involving the design, construction, finance,
operation and maintenance of three new commuter rail lines and a commuter rail facility.
RTD engaged Denver Transit Partners (DTP), a consortium led by Fluor and Balfour

TIMELINE

•

•

Beatty as the Concessionaire. The Project was slated for completion and revenue service
in 2016, with a 29-year concession period.
DTP committed to design and construct a modern Positive Train Control (PTC) system
with a first of its kind Wireless Crossing Activation System (WCAS) functionality to meet
regulatory requirements for Quiet Zones and grade crossing safety. The system was to
provide a constant warning time to ensure a reasonably uniform warning time, regardless
of train speed, to reinforce crossing safety and discourage unsafe behavior at grade
crossings.
DTP experienced a variety of issues during design, construction, systems testing, and
operation that impacted DTP’s ability to obtain regulators’ acceptance of the new system.
In April 2016, the University of Colorado A Line entered revenue service under an FRA
waiver and employing grade crossing attendants at the crossings. Since that time, DTP
has taken steps to optimize the system, hired outside consultants to review the system,
and respond to regulators’ questions about the grade crossing warning system. The
system continues to operate under an FRA waiver.
Both the FRA and the CPUC have utilized their existing processes to ensure, based on
credible, measurable data that the grade crossing warning system operates safely. In
addition, DTP experienced further delays in completing field inspections, obtaining
approvals of testing protocols and completing operational verifications with trains to
ensure the warning system operates as designed.
Now, most of the field verifications are complete, and RTD expects the CPUC to accept
the remaining University of Colorado A Line crossings in the next 2 or 3 weeks. Upon FRA
approval of the grade crossing attendant removal plan for those crossings, RTD will begin
a public notification campaign reminding roadway users to obey the warning devices at
the crossings, after which the flaggers will be removed from the crossings in a controlled
manner.
DTP has not yet obtained approval from the FRA to begin the final testing necessary to
begin revenue service on the G Line.

o In-District: first 24 hours free, $2/daily after first 24 hours
o Out-of-District: $4 daily fee
• Being in-district or out-of-district depends on where your car is registered, not where
you currently live.
• You can pay for parking at the pay station, pay by phone or download the app.
• Vehicles may not be parked continuously for longer than 30 days.
Safety
• Safety is RTD’s number one priority and we want to remind people to be safe around
trains
• Stop, Look, and Listen prior to crossing any railroad tracks; commuter rail trains are
quiet and can approach from both directions
• Never play near commuter rail tracks or trains and do not walk on the rail tracks.
Switches on the tracks move automatically and can cause injury. In addition, you would
be breaking the law by trespassing
• Be safe near commuter rail platforms – there is a 4 foot drop from where you board the
train to where the actual tracks are
• Before crossing rail tracks at a road crossing, make sure to use the gate and that the
crossing gates are all the way up, and that there are no flashing lights or bells
• Keep yourself and all objects away from the overhead wires
• Get off your bike, scooter, or skateboard before you cross the tracks. Wheels can get
caught in the opening next to the track
• When crossing the tracks, PAY ATTENTION – Don’t let your cell phones, headphones,
texting or game playing divert your attention
• Never chase a moving train
• Never play on or around construction equipment
• Always stay in public areas and don’t cross fences or barriers

1.C.1.a

Service Changes
When the G Line opens the following bus routes and Park-n-Rides affected:
• New routes – 53, 55, 99, 125
• Discontinued routes – 31L, 55L, 72L
• Route modifications – 8, 17, 19, 31, 50, 51, 52, 72, 76, 100
• Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride will be moving across the street to the Olde Town
Arvada Station
• Ward Road Park-n-Ride will be closing and replaced with Wheat Ridge/Ward Station (1mile away)
Positive Train Control
• As part of the commuter train safety, the trains use Positive Train Control Technology
(PTC).
• If a train is traveling too fast, a train is stopped ahead or a maintenance crew is working
on the track, PTC signals the operator to slow or stop the train.
• If the operator doesn’t respond within 8 seconds, the train will automatically slow or
stop.
• PTC technology is a Federal Railroad Administration requirement for all passenger rail
systems in the country. RTD is the first in the U.S. to have PTC built into a commuter
rail system “from the ground up”.
Commuter Rail
• The University of Colorado A Line is the first rail line to have commuter rail trains.
• Each railcar is 85 feet long.
• Runs in “married pairs”- two vehicles attached at once
• LCD screens and overhead announcements provide updates on current location and
upcoming stations.
• They have some different features than light rail trains:
o Designed to travel faster, longer distances with less stops
o Max speed is 79 MPH (light rail is 55 MPH)
o 91 seats
o Level boarding
o Luggage racks, overhead carry-on storage areas and areas for skis/bikes
o Two ADA/handicapped seating areas per train car
• The vehicles will be maintained, serviced and cleaned at the commuter rail maintenance facility
(CRMF) at 5151 Fox St. in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood.

Quiet Zones:
•
•

•

•
•
•
•

Federal Law requires all trains that travel on or adjacent to freight tracks to sound
their horns when the train approaches a railroad crossing. This falls under the
Federal Train Horn Rule (49 CFR Part 222).
Quiet Zones are railroad line segments where train operators don’t have to sound
their train horns at the crossing on a routine basis. Horns will continue to be used for
emergency situations and if there are maintenance workers along the tracks, as
required by the Federal Regulation.
Quiet Zones are not guaranteed to be implemented by opening day on any corridor.
The zones will be established once all regulatory approvals are processed which
could be after each opening of any rail line. However, all entities are working hard to
certify the railroad crossings so that Quiet Zones can start by the opening day of the
Gold (G) Line.
Adams County and the City of Arvada have already both submitted applications for
Quiet Zones along the entire Gold (G) Line; RTD assisted in the application process.
The public should expect to hear train horns during the testing of the Gold (G) Line
until the Quiet Zones are approved and established.
Until Quiet Zones are established, locomotive engineers must begin to sound train
horns at least 15 seconds, and no more than 20 seconds, in advance of all public
grade crossings.
If a train is traveling faster than 60 mph, engineers will not sound the horn until it is
within a 1/4 mile of the crossing, even if the advance warning is less than 15
seconds.

At-Grade Crossings:

1.C.1.a

•
•

•
•

•

There is a "good faith" exception for locations where engineers cannot precisely
estimate their arrival at a crossing and begin to sound the horn no more than 25
seconds before arriving at the crossing.
Train horns must be sounded in a standardized pattern of 2 long, 1 short and 1 long
blasts. The pattern must be repeated or prolonged until the lead locomotive or lead
cab car occupies the grade crossing. The rule does not stipulate the durations of
long and short blasts.
The maximum volume level for the train horn is 110 decibels which is a new federal
requirement. The minimum sound level remains 96 decibels.
RTD’s Responsible Rail Amendment: Federal regulations require cities and counties
to file the application for requesting a quiet zone. In 2007, the RTD Board adopted
the Responsible Rail Amendment, which calls for active involvement from RTD in
helping communities establish Quiet Zones along commuter rail lines.
To qualify for a quiet zone, many safety measures were built into the crossings and
include exit gates, pedestrian gates, channelization, safety signage, and
audible/visual alerts.

Even when the Quiet Zones are approved, the operator is obligated to use their horn in
any event they consider “unsafe” or if there are maintenance workers along the tracks.
Likewise, at any time the FRA deems it necessary, the quiet zone can be eliminated and
horn use resumed due to an increase in unsafe incidents at the crossing(s).

Re:

Service Availability - June 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 98.98% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in June 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons did increase as follows:





June 2018 – 1,444.99 hours
June 2017 - 203.13 hours
Year-to-date numbers 2017 – 1,421.75 hours
Year-to-day number for 2018 - 8,740.53 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 98.98% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2,195 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 17,560 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our Contractor Partners, First Transit, and TransDev.
Contributing to our service challenges in June were multiple bus bridges and special
events. Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to address
ways to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.
