1.C.1.a

Observations
• Resolution 10 is outdated and needs to be updated
• Federal regulations affect the process and should be
recognized and dealt with early
• Need for consistent and transparent process when dealing with
people inside and outside RTD
• Existing unsolicited proposal policy excludes real property, and is
structured for capital projects, and materials and services
proposals
• Important for real property process to have some flexibility
because each project is unique
• Obtaining current valuation and title work may take time and
should be initiated early in the process

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.1.a

Proposed Next Steps
•

Replace existing Resolution 10:
•

Clarify administrative (GM) v. Board level approvals for
real property interests
•

•

•

Eg: Minor utility easements, ROW dedications

Conform to FTA regulations for disposition and joint
development.
•

Federal regulations have specific processes that determine how
minimum property value is established

•

Provide a consistent process for all property regardless of FTA
interest

Incorporate a policy for unsolicited real property
proposals
•

Encourage leveraging real property assets while providing
consistent and transparent review process

Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Presentation (2378 : Real Prop. Unsolicited Proposal)

1.C.1.a

Proposed Next Steps
• Develop an unsolicited proposal policy for real property:
• Establish a formal, streamlined process for evaluating
proposals that encourages innovation in leveraging
real property assets
• Clarify differences in process for excess property
disposition vs joint development
•

Excess Property: No longer needed for any transit purpose

•

Joint Development: Current or future transit interest in the
property; broadly defined

• Establish criteria for accepting sole source joint
development proposals.
