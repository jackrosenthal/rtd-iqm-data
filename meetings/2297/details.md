There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Policy

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities (TOC), and Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented Development (TOD), reviewed a Power Point with the Board that is available in the June 6, 2015 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.

Bill Sirois noted that in addition to RTD’s Policies governing RTD real property (Resolution 10 of 1984 and Strategic Plan for TOD), we are also governed by State Enabling Legislation (C.R.S. 32-9-101) and Federal Regulations (Circular 5010.1D – Real Property Disposition and Circular 7050.1 – Joint Development).  He reminded the Directors about the Real Property Pilot Program and TOD Pilot Program that staff are currently implementing.  Bill Sirois stated that in reviewing our governing policies/regulations and pilot programs staff had several observations:

- Resolution 10 is outdated and needs to be updated

- Federal regulations affect the process and should be recognized and dealt with early

- Need for consistent and transparent process when dealing with people inside and outside RTD

- Existing unsolicited proposal policy excludes real property and its structure for capital projects and materials and services proposals

- Important for real property process to have some flexibility because each project is unique

- Obtaining current valuation and title work may take time and should be initiated early in the process

Kate Iverson stated that this is really just the beginning of a discussion around the proposed framework for a Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Policy.  She said that staff will be coming to the Board over the course of the year with more information and process progresses.  She said the proposed next steps are to:

- Replace existing Resolution 10

o        Clarify administrative (General Manager) versus Board level approvals for real property interests

o        Conform to FTA regulations for disposition and joint development

o        Incorporate a policy for unsolicited real property proposals

- Develop an unsolicited proposal policy for real property

o        Establish a formal, streamlined process for evaluating proposals that encourages innovation in leveraging real property assets

o        Clarify differences in process for excess property disposition versus joint development

o        Establish criteria for accepting sole source joint development proposals

She explained that staff is currently looking at the following criteria for sole source justification:

1)      The proposer owns or can demonstrate legal control (such as a purchase option or long term lease) of property contiguous to RTD property;

AND

2)      The proposed development concept leverages that contiguous ownership to provide benefits to RTD that could not be achieved by EITHER i) a standalone development of the RTD property, OR ii) by a development proposed by another contiguous property owner.

Kate Iverson reiterated that this would be a multi-step process during which time they would keep the Board informed of their progress.  She also noted that staff planned to involve RTD’s TOD Assessment consultants to review the draft resolution and unsolicited proposal policy.

Committee Chair James thanked staff for the flow chart that outlined the unsolicited proposal process.  He thought it really helped demonstrate the logic behind the process.  He wondered what legal restraints there might be on RTD related to our participation in joint development.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that joint development is something that RTD does fairly often.  Examples of this are Federal Center, Boulder Transit Village and Denver Union Station, just to highlight a few.  RTD partners with an adjacent property owner to jointly install infrastructure or provide for maintenance of walkways, landscaping, etc. in way that are much more effective and efficient than if we were doing them on our own.  She explained that in terms of co-ownership there are constitutional prohibitions against RTD having legal partnerships with a private entity but we can always enter into long term leases.

Director Lubow inquired if there was a practical or legal presumption that we prefer competition and sole source only happens when competition is not advisable.  Marla Lien stated that from a practical perspective RTD would prefer competition.  She said that since we have so much federal interest in what we do there is a very strong presumption that all sources of material, contracts, uses and services are to be competed unless you meet more limited sole source criteria.

Director Lubow asked if before going to sole source RTD would need to justify that we meet federal criteria for establishing preference for sole source.  Marla Lien explained that the FTA does not have sole source criteria.  RTD must ensure the disposition gets fair market value or fair return on the investment but they do not preclude sole source.  Director Lubow expressed concern that RTD might be setting a policy that is unnecessarily restrictive as it relates to sole source.  She suggested creating some type of task force to get public feedback about the policy.

Committee Chair James asked for confirmation that a sole source does not happen just because an entity owns adjacent property.  There must also be transparency, being fair, maximizing value to RTD, etc.  Kate Iverson explained that it is a two-step process for a sole source.  First, the entity must own property immediately adjacent to RTD property.  But, there must also be a clear benefit to RTD.  She believes that there are parcels that could be developed as stand-alone so staff needs to evaluate every proposal to make sure we are not foregoing a better offer.

Director Menten noted that while the presentation was titled Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Policy, there was also a great deal related to RTD’s overall excess property disposition through Resolution 10.  She was wondering if RTD would give a former property owner first rights to regain property they previously owned prior to putting it out for a competitive bid.  Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Property, explained that when RTD acquires property under eminent domain the regulation does not really provide for the ability to offer the property back to the property owner.  She shared that previously the Board did pass a resolution that the Ft. Lupton properties could be sold back to the original owners; however, there was absolutely no interest.  Marla Lien stressed that the Ft. Lupton land acquisition and resolution happened within a year.  She acknowledged that a lot of what Director Menten was asking about related to RTD only needing a portion of someone’s property.  She reminded the Board that in those instances the property owner has the decision in if they wish to keep the leftover portion of their property or have RTD purchase the entire parcel.

Director Menten wanted to make sure that we always advertise property the old fashioned way by sticking a “for sale” sign in the ground.  She recognized that technology is moving forward but the sign in the ground can still grab a lot of people’s attention.  Susan Altes reminded the Board that as part of the Real Property Disposition Pilot Program there were four distinct approaches selected to test in the disposition process so that did not happen for every property; however, it was very effective at the Ft. Lupton property.  Kate Iverson noted that what was being discussed this evening was really related to when someone contacted RTD about a property, not about our efforts to generate interest.

Committee Chair James asked Bill Sirois if he could discuss their efforts on putting real property information on RTD’s website.  Bill Sirois said that was something the TOC department has been working to ramp up.  Having defined policies/procedures will really help provide the public with more information.

Director Francone requested a copy of Resolution 10.  Committee Chair James asked staff to send it to the full Board.

Director Hoy shared that he is a big proponent of sign in the ground and a list of properties RTD owns that is easy to find.  It is hard to get an unsolicited proposal on a piece of land that no one knows RTD owns.  He recognized that while it was definitely time for an update of Resolution 10, he would like the process to be one where the Board gets to review the proposed resolution much in advance of when they will be asked to approve it.  Bill Sirois stated that was staff’s plan.

Director Hoy expressed his surprise at how many acres of the Ft. Lupton property were under contract.  He wondered if there was a closing date.  Susan Altes explained that there was a due diligence period of 180 days.  She said that the property went under contract April 8th.  Due to the length of time of the due diligence period Susan Altes did negotiate several triggers that would increase the purchase price of the property, such as the buyer not exercising the right to close in 120 days.

Director Walker shared that the number one, perhaps only, complaint he hears from developers is that they do not understand our real estate process.  He believes understanding the why and how will really help them a lot.  He said he could see a scenario where an adjoining property owner might be able to develop a small property in conjunction with the property that they own that would not be developable to us.  He likes the direction staff is moving.

##### a. Real Property Unsolicited Proposal Presentation

#### 2. 16th Street Mall

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said that staff wanted to give another update on the 16th Street Mall reconstruction because at the last update staff indicated that this month they would be coming back to the committee with a request to move forward with a contractor.  He reminded the Board that the project was broken up into two phases.  One phase was for reconstruction of everything except the transit way.  Simultaneously, staff was working with the FTA to look at the impact of going forward with a different surface for the transit way, which is a process than can take 8-12 months.

Rick Clarke stated that we received one bid that was 57% above our engineer’s estimate.  He explained that instead of bringing the Board an action to approve, staff is going to step back and do some reassessment.  They will be meeting with the contractor next week to try to understand the costs as some do not make sense to staff.  He said that staff hopes we can work with the contractor to lower the bid even though they recognize this is a big ASK.

Rick Clarke noted there are several other options.  RTD could take the money designated for reconstruction of the transitway and use it to cover this overrun; however, staff does not think this is in the best interest of RTD.  He said that RTD can and will ask the stakeholders for additional funding.  The last option is to put everything on hold while we continue to work with the FTA.

Stan Szabelak, Engineering Project Manager, reminded the Board that part of the bid included intersection work for the City and County of Denver (City).  The City’s work was 21% over the engineer’s estimate while RTD’s was 50% over.  There were line items that came in 40x more than our engineer’s estimate.  He said that often estimates are within a couple percentage points, not times factors.  He thinks that perhaps the contractor does not understand some elements of the project.

Committee Chair James wondered if there was any potential for reaching out to other contractors to cultivate interest in the project.  He asked if the low interest was due to there being so much construction occurring in the Denver metro area.  Rick Clarke stated that was correct.  Construction companies in the Denver area are extremely busy right now.  He said if we put the project out to bid again staff plans to beat the bushes to generate a more competitive bidding environment but that might not help.

Committee Chair James inquired about the ramifications of putting the project on hold, which RTD is doing right now at least for a short period of time.  Rick Clarke explained that there are challenges with putting the project on hold, even while we work through the evaluation process with them.  The FTA likes to see RTD draw down on the funds we have been awarded.  Staff will need to speak with the FTA and ask for their patience as we work through the challenges.

Director Lasater asked for clarification that the bid received was just for things like sidewalks and not the transitway.  Rick Clarke stated that was correct.  Director Lasater shared that several years ago when the Parker City Council was trying to do some roadway work the bids came in exceptionally high and they opted not to move forward.  He wondered if this was an option for RTD as well.  Rick Clarke noted that in some ways we are doing just that; however, the transitway cannot be put on hold forever.  Director Lasater asked if there was any further dialog on using a different material for the transitway.  Rick Clarke stated that is the process that staff is working thought with the FTA right now.  He reiterated that the process is a long process that includes public involvement.

Committee Chair James thanked staff for the update.
