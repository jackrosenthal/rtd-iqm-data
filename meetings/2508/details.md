Others present:              General Manager Genova, Acting Executive Director Barbara McManus, General Counsel Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel Jenifer Ross-Amato

Chair Tobiassen provided the initial review of the Board Meeting agenda for August 16, 2016 and indicated there would be a Public Hearing for the amendment of the Amended Budget and that there were three unanimous consent items and 3 recommended actions on the agenda. Chair asked if Jerry Nery would be at the board meeting to be recognized.  Barbara McManus indicated that the Board Office was waiting to hear back from Mr. Nery.  Chair Tobiassen confirmed that the committee reports and last month’s Board Meeting would be in the Board meeting packet on Friday for all Directors to review.

Chair Tobiassen went through the unanimous consent agenda mentioning that he is pleased that Derrick Black was chosen for the Salaried Pension Trustee Appointment and he was impressed with his credentials as a litigator.  General Manager Genova said when saw him in an interview setting he was very impressed as well.  Rolf Asphaug noted that he would like to speak about Derrick Black at the Board Meeting.  Chair Tobiassen continued to review the unanimous consent items and asked once he completed if there were any questions regarding the consent agenda.

Director Francone asked to speak about the Parking Management Extended to New Facilities Board action.  Director Francone asked if RTD was trying to standardize parking why there were independent agreements for Aurora and Arvada.  She said that to her, it appeared that there was special treatment for these 2 locations.  General Manager Genova explained that Aurora and Arvada were (TOD) Transit Oriented Development projects within their respective communities.  General Manager Genova went on to say that shared parking was also in effect in Boulder and that shared parking contracts in general were very complex, and the Board would not see any additional contracts of this type coming from him.

Director Solano said he was at a meeting earlier in the day and parking in Commerce City was a topic of conversation.  At that meeting, they agreed that partnering with communities to standardize across the district is the best solution.  General Manager Genova said he was not familiar with any parking plans in Commerce City other than RTD parking.  Chair Tobiassen added that Aurora, as well as Arvada had made a substantial contribution to enhance parking at those stations.

Director Deadwyler mentioned she was still not happy that RTD will be paying the City of Aurora for maintenance of the parking facility since Aurora will not sharing in the revenue.  Director Deadwyler is also concerned with the parking fees to the constituents in a shared parking scenario.

First Chair Larry Hoy said he might be voting this down and that he will meet with Westminster in the following days to make sure they are on board with this arrangement.  Chair Tobiassen asked that the Executive Committee move forward in the review of the agenda.

#### A. 2016-013 : Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of 2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.

Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System only are detailed as follows:

1)      De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.  Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement Fund.

2)      Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million.  As a result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in 2016.

3)      Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million.  In place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-Appropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016.   Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.  Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.

4)      Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million.  In place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.  Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.  Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $15.0 million.

5)      Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million.  As a result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end 2016.

Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting the Base System include:

1)      Increase to other income of $9.0 million.  It is proposed that TABOR reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for providing the Blake building as collateral.

2)      Increase to investment income of $0.39 million.  A revision to estimated investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.

Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project only are detailed as follows:

1)      Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.  This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.

2)      Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each.  The reduction to each of these funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use of these fund balances.

The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0 million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

## II. Bylaws/Procedures Discussion

Chair Tobiassen introduced Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel and Jenifer Ross-Amato, Acting Deputy General Counsel, to the committee and noted that they will be speaking to the review and update of the current Board of Directors Bylaws.

Rolf Asphaug stated that he and Barbara McManus have been reviewing the Bylaws for changes and presented a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation outlining the 5 factors that have been identified as needing changes, as follows:

- Housekeeping

- Committee meetings/study sessions

- Legal Compliance

- Bylaws amendments and

- Board office staff management

Rolf reviewed the 5 factors, giving specific relevant and recent examples of the type of changes that were identified.  Rolf indicated the Executive Committee would be given a copy of the draft document for review and comments.

Director Deadwyler asked if the Directors had the opportunity to determine the amount of materials that were moved forward in the committee meeting and the Study Sessions.  Chair Tobiassen reviewed that what was brought forward in Committee meeting was relevant information and sometimes the volume cannot be avoided and still meet the needs of the business.  General Manager Genova mentioned that last Tuesday’s meeting had quite a lot of information and that a number of items were pushed off because of the length of the meeting and that he had requested his team to be cognoscente of the volume at the meetings.

Under the subtitle bylaw amendments, Chair Tobiassen asked for clarity around a majority and supermajority and asked if Rolf could clarify if it was a majority or supermajority of the whole or of the body that was present.  Rolf verified it was the body that was present that would carry the vote.

The last item outlined was the Board Office staff management.  Rolf reviewed that there has been quite a bit of debate regarding the management of the Board Office Staff.  Rolf went on to say that the current structure does not follow the same guidelines as the agency as a whole and commented that there is an opportunity to make changes to protect the Directors and the staff and unify the Board Office to the agency guidelines.

Jenifer Ross-Amato spoke to the employment guidelines and outlined some specific actions that she felt were critical to protect both the Director and staff.  Jenifer further clarified what the legal department would defend against and in what scenarios they would not.  Making the change would insulate the Directors from any employment related claims or litigated issues.

Director Deadwyler explained a few scenarios over the last 6 years that she has heard about of in terms of how HR handled some issues within the Board Office.  She also spoke of difficulties in getting changes through HR that have been requested by the previous Executive Director, Paula Perdue.  Director Deadwyler said there needs to be consistency in how the Board Office is managed.  General Manager Genova reviewed the process that is used for recruiting and for re-evaluating employee job descriptions.  Director Deadwyler said there are some scenarios that need to be reviewed and that she would like to see a 360 performance appraisal presented to the full Board since the Board Office staff report to them directly.

The process of managing the Executive Manager and Board staff was discussed at length and how this can be changed to be more inclusive and consistent with the rest of the agency.

Chair Tobiassen spoke about some of the challenges he has had as Chair in not knowing the ins and outs of the RTD Culture, especially in regards to how all processes outside the Board office work.

Chair Tobiassen gave an update on where RTD is in the process of recruiting for the Executive Manager position.  No exact timing has been developed for moving forward at this moment but he asked the Executive Committee to be flexible, as once the process is in motion it will move swiftly.  Chair Tobiassen outlined the time commitment that would be required in the interview process and that once the candidates were determined, he would like the interview process to happen marathon style so only one of 2 days were needed to complete the process.

Barbara McManus gave a review of changes that she has been working on with Rolf Asphaug and Heather Copp regarding the Director’s Expense policy.  Barbara gave an outline of some of the discrepancies that were missing from the policy, updates to statutes, and IRS guidelines.  She indicated there were some challenges for the Chair as he reviewed travel and local expenses throughout the year and asked for the policy to be more clearly defined.

Chair Tobiassen noted that each of the redlined documents will be given to each Executive Committee member at the end of the meeting for their review.  Chair Tobiassen said any questions or comments should be sent to Rolf Asphaug, Barbara McManus or him and open for discussion in next month’s Committee Meeting.

Seeing no other questions, Chair Tobiassen asked to move onto other matters.

## III. Other Matters

Director Deadwyler spoke about the Brick City Event that happened on Saturday, August 6th.  RTD’s WIN program, Director Deadwyler and Terry Emmons were in attendance as well as Mayor Hancock, Police Chief White and the Director of Denver recreation department.  Director Deadwyler thought the event went well and that RTD should attend every year.

Director Francone mentioned the anonymous e-mail that all the Directors received yesterday regarding an unfair hiring practice and the opinion that the process was not objective and favoritism was involved.  General Manager Genova explained the process was done through a panel so no one individual makes the decision.  Director Hoy mentioned that he has been contacted 4 times over the past number of weeks and feels there is something going on and the Board needs to get to the bottom of the issue.  Director Francone said there may or may not be something going, but it is the perception of what is happening and the Board may need to take a look at the inquiries.

Barbara McManus outlined the continuous improvement process for GMR’s that staff is working on.  She mentioned that Directors Deadwyler and Francone were part of the Executive Review Team and that the process was an eye opener as to how extensive it was.  Barbara said she will be bringing a draft process to Executive Committee in the fall with some recommended changes to be implemented by end of year.

Barbara McManus gave some background information on the (ECM) Enterprise Content Management and because of the nature of that project, she would be preparing and bringing forward a sole source for approval of 5 one year options for Accela, MinuteTraq and E-board room.  She added that it did not make sense to convert our data to another piece of software if it was not compatible with the agency wide software.

Barbara McManus informed the Executive Committee that she would be on vacation from September 6th – 19th.

## IV. Adjourn

Chair Tobiassen adjourned the meeting at 1:30 p.m.
