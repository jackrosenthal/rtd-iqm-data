Public Hearing for Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
A.

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____,
Series of 2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for
the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest
expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital
Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund
balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the
inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the
Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and estimated
unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base
System only are detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the
planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be
replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place
of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-

Appropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund balances instead
of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.
Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In
place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital
Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve ongoing debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual
fund usage is $15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a
result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is
projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end
2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget
affecting the Base System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to
estimated investment income is made due to higher market interest
rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks
Project only are detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs. This revision is necessary to correct a request made in
the Amended Budget in error which resulted in overstatement of
budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund,
and unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to
each of these funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating
expense and is not a use of these fund balances.

The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of
$45.0 million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit
I.

$15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a result of the

Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting the Base
System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR reserves in the
amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for providing the Blake building as
collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated investment
income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project only are
detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs. This revision
is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in error which resulted in

DISCUSSION
Base System
RTD staff has completed its development of the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan for the Base
System and determined that certain revisions were necessary to the 2016 Amended Budget as
previously approved. It was determined that the planned 2016 $50 million COP (Certificates of
Participation) debt issuance for fleet acquisition would negatively impact RTD’s ability to meet
projected debt service coverage requirements, which is already being challenged by overall lower
revenue estimates. In order to support the planned fleet purchase, it is proposed that both the
Board-appropriated reserve fund and capital replacement reserve fund be utilized in lieu of the COPs
to complete the fleet purchase obligation. In the 2017-2022 SBP, restoration of both reserve funds
to their previous levels is projected to occur as quickly as possible, no later than 2020.
The result of these revisions will be to lower the Base System unrestricted year-end fund balance by
$1.4 million to $2.1 million. Also, non-issuance of the COPs is estimated to lower interest expense
on the Base System by $0.45 million.
Revenue revisions for the Base System include an increase to other income of $9.0 million from
release of TABOR reserves in exchange for collateral of the Blake building. Replacing TABOR
reserves with real property or other assets will allow RTD to access $9.0 million in cash in those

Packet Pg. 13

2.11.A

accounts (we will revise the RTD Fiscal Policy Statement for 2017 to allow both cash and other
assets to be pledged for this reserve). This is an approach used by several other municipalities.
The $9.0 million will be used towards fleet acquisition in 2016 as well as overall balancing of the
2016 Amended Budget. Investment income is also revised upward by $0.39 million based on
higher interest rate forecasts. Revenue is estimated and not appropriated by the Board in the RTD
budget.
FasTracks
A reduction of $8.8 million to operating expense in FasTracks Project is proposed to correct an
overstatement that resulted from a request made in error for I-225 operating expense in the
previously approved Amended Budget. The reduction affects the Capital Programs department.
The result of this revision will be to lower the FasTracks Project Board-appropriated fund, capital
replacement fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance by $0.5 million each because
these funds are calculated at two months of operating expense which is being reduced by $8.8
million. This does not represent a use of fund balances, but rather a reduction based on calculation
of required amounts.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to be $11.4 million,
down from $13.4 million in the previously approved Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System to reflect: 1) de-appropriation of $50.0
million in new financing proceeds, 2) reduction of $0.45 million in estimated interest expense, 3)
reduction of $14.8 million to the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) reduction of $18.0 million to the
Capital Replacement Fund, and 5) reduction of $1.4 million to the year-end unrestricted fund
balance. Amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project to reflect: 1) reduction of
$8.8 million in operating expense, and 2) reduction of $0.5 million each to the BoardAppropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund and year-end unrestricted fund balance. This is
the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2016 Amended Budget and amend
with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2016 Amended Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2016
Amended Budget would not reflect other adjustments necessary to balance the 2016 Budget
and the 2017-2022 SBP, preserve debt service coverage, and correct previously budgeted
operating expense.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Date:

Subject:

Salaried Pension Trustee Appointment

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: August 4, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Derrick Black to a term expiring 12/31/2017 as
a trustee for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On May 31, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution
further provided that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans were to remain as trustees
with revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms, and that after acceptance of
applications and screening in accordance with the Plans, an employee who is a participant in the Defined
Contribution Plan be appointed to replace retired trustee Marla Lien.
The application and screening process has now been completed, and employee Derrick Black is
recommended for appointment as a trustee to the Plans.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve Derrick Black to serve as a trustee on the Plans in
accordance with the attached resolution. This is recommended because the employee has applied
and been screened for the position, and will replace the retired trustee assuring continued
representation going forward.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

RESOLUTION No. _____ SERIES OF 2016
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE TO THE RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ PENSION TRUST
AND RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN TRUST

Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Salaried Employees' Pension Plan and Trust ("Pension Plan"
or "Pension Trust") for salaried employees hired by RTD before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Salaried
Employees' Defined Contribution Plan and Trust ("Defined Contribution Plan" or "Defined Contribution
Trust") for salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, which may collectively be referred to
as the "Trusts"; and,
Whereas, two RTD Board Directors and five salaried employees serve as the same sets of
trustees for each of the above Trusts as further described below; and,
Whereas, on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of
2008 providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried
Employee Pension Trust Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and
Audit Committee) will screen applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the
senior management salaried employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board; and,
Whereas, on May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors
amended the Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle”
management distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee
Trustees who participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan,
in addition to the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer
who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts; and
Whereas, in the above Resolution the RTD Board of Directors further reappointed two existing
employee Trustees participating in the Pension Plan and one employee Trustee participating in the
Defined Contribution Plan, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts, leaving one
vacancy for an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Contribution Plan to be selected by the
Board; and
Whereas, in accordance with the above Resolutions the Board accepted candidates for the
vacant position whose applications were screened, with a recommendation brought back to the Board;
and
Whereas, in accordance with the above Resolutions the RTD Board of Directors now wishes to
appoint Derrick Black to serve as an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Contribution Plan to
serve as a trustee on both of the Trusts, with a term expiring 12/31/2017.

Refunding of 2007A FasTracks Bonds

Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the refinancing of the
Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds.
BACKGROUND
RTD issued the Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds to partially refinance the Series2006A
FasTracks Bonds to realize a savings in interest expense.
Recent changes in interest rates and the approaching 2017 call date on certain of the Series 2007A
FasTracks Refunding Bonds have created an opportunity to again realize a reduction in interest
expense.
DISSCUSSION
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund a portion of
the remaining outstanding Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds (“Series 2007A Bonds”),
subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $11.1 million (8.06% of principal). RTD
policy requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in
interest rates between now and the date the new refunding bonds are sold. The Series 2007A
Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
Staff has recommended the adoption of this resolution to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD
to reduce its overall interest expense related to the Series 2007A Bonds in the coming years. While
the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of a
cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest expense of the Series 2007A Bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the
new refunding bonds and call date of the Series 2007A Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”).
Absent a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a
reduction in time proceeds of the new refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the
Series 2007A Bonds. Despite the cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings
from a refunding of the Series 2007A Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the inclusion of the Series 2007A
FasTracks Refunding Bonds in the current refunding project authorized by the Board in May 2016.
Drafts of documents including the Indenture, the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary
Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.

2.12.C

RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Sherman & Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten
by a team including Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Piper Jaffray, and Harvestons Securities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees. The length of the refunded bonds will not exceed the length of existing Series 2007A Bonds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the refinancing of the Series 2007A FastTrack’s Refunding Bonds. This is
the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2016, authorizing the issuance of the District’s refinancing of the Series 2007A
FastTrack’s Refunding Bonds. This is not the recommended action as it would not take
advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Amend Contract 25FK006 - Cutaway Buses to
add enhanced ADA features

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend contract 25FK006 in an amount not to exceed
$340,000 with Master’s Transportation, a dealer for Goshen Coach, for the addition of ADA-related
items to better accommodate passengers with disabilities.
It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $340,000 from the Flatiron
Flyer bus procurement, the cutaway transit bus and the in-plant vehicles & equipment projects to cover
the cost of the requested additional items.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance cutaway buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of up to 241 cutaway
buses. This procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB 25FK006) on October 19, 2015.
Bids were received on December 8, 2015. Master’s Transportation was the responsive and responsible
low bidder.
In June this year, the bus manufacturer, Goshen Coach, built a pilot bus and sent it to Denver for RTD
review and approval. RTD invited members of ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) and the
Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) to review the ADA features of the bus. As a result of this
review, five changes were requested by the group, to include the addition of more handrails and hand
straps to assist ambulatory passengers in standing up from a seating position and moving about the bus,
and the reconfiguration of the wheelchair tiedowns to better accommodate various sizes of wheelchair
devices.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Master’s Transportation for the
addition of ADA features to better accommodate passengers with disabilities, and to transfer funds from
three projects, Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, cutaway transit bus and in-plant vehicles & equipment
projects to cover for the additional cost.
DISCUSSION
The new Goshen cutaway buses will be 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an extended
sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, eight foldable seats for ambulatory
passengers, and three wheelchair tiedown areas.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 33

2.12.D

Additional funds in the amount of $340,000 are needed to fund the contract amendment. Capital funds
from three projects, Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, cutaway transit bus procurement and in-plant
vehicles and equipment procurement, are available for transfer to this project. These projects have been
completed or are in process of being completed. We are recommending the transfer of existing excess
capital funds from three closing-out projects into this contract. No additional funds are required so the
capital budget impact is zero.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, the bus manufacturer, Goshen Coach, has submitted a certificate
attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Master’s Transportation for the
addition of ADA bus features, and to transfer the capital funds to fund the amendment. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment. This is not desirable as it would result in the production
and delivery of Access-a-Ride buses that do not fully accommodate the expressed needs of the disabled
community.

and Facilities

GM

Subject:

Parking Management
Facilities

Extended

to

New

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve adding to the RTD Parking Management Program all of RTD's parking facilities along the
University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line, including Westminster Station until and unless
the Board approves other arrangements with Westminster, but not including Iliff Station and Olde Town
Arvada; and to authorize the General Manager to amend RTD’s parking management Contract
#13D0002 as necessary to include and manage the added facilities.
BACKGROUND
The Board-approved 2008 Parking Management Program was implemented in 2009 under constraints
imposed by the Colorado State legislature that limited which patrons can be charged for parking to, (1)
out-of-District patrons every day, (2) in-District patrons after the first 24 hours, and (3) reserved parking
in exchange for a flat monthly fee. Patrons may pay for parking at pay stations with exact cash or
credit, with pay-by-phone or with an “automated” account (pre-arranged, declining balance, 15%
discounted), or in-District patrons may subscribe to the Reserved parking program which reserves them
the right to access parking in a designated pool between 5am and 10am each weekday. After 10am
unused spaces may be used by any patron (at facilities where Reserved demand exceeds the legislated
maximum of 15% of each facility’s capacity, a waiting list is created). Approximately 18% of RTD
boardings result from patrons who park at RTD facilities and about 15% of those who park actually pay
for parking in one form or another.
At the time the Program was adopted approximately forty (40) parking facilities were included in the
Program, referred to as “designated facilities”. In November of 2012, when parking management
contract amendments were being considered by the Board, the new West Corridor parking facilities were
“designated” for inclusion in the Parking Management Program. That was the first major addition to
“designated facilities” since adoption in 2008. Prior to that time minor deletions, based upon unique
circumstances, had occurred as provided in the original Program. With various deletions, closings and
the addition of West Corridor, the Program currently is implemented at 36 RTD operated facilities.
DISCUSSION
In 2016, consistent with our practice of implementing the Program in all parking facilities in a corridor,
we plan to add the parking facilities in University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line that will
add 14 new parking facilities, 3 of which may be operated by others depending upon the outcome of
negotiations. In accordance with the existing contract, SP+ (formerly Central Parking) will purchase the
pay stations and other necessary equipment to manage these facilities and will recover the cost from
parking revenues.
After review of how facilities are included in the Program, the General Manager, as an alternative to
seeking Board approval on a case by case basis, believes the Board may agree that it is more efficient to

Packet Pg. 35

2.13.E

grant the General Manager broader authority to include new parking facilities in the Parking Management
Program as deemed appropriate consistent with size, location, ownership, stakeholder participation and
shared use considerations. This would align inclusion of parking facilities into the Parking Management
Program with the timing of planning and design of parking facilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Addition of these 2016 facilities will increase annual parking revenues and will capture a greater portion
of extended parking beyond the first day by DIA travelers. Operating expenses are recovered from
revenues.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking facilities in the Parking
Management Program.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action. Authorize the General Manager to include only new
parking facilities in the Parking Management Program that are planned to open in 2016, as
mentioned above.

IGA with Aurora
Parking Structure

concerning

Iliff

Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City of Aurora for the
utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms outlined under Discussion in
this Action.
BACKGROUND
The Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA was negotiated to fulfill Aurora’s desire to have a parking
structure instead of two surface lots that were in the FasTracks plan. This was conceived as a mutually
beneficial partnership that would accelerate development and enhance ridership long term at no
additional cost to RTD with the same 600 parking spaces available for RTD patrons.
The following table depicts capital, in-kind and estimated operation and maintenance costs and
responsibilities pertinent to each party according to the IGA:

Aurora seeks to, in part, offset its significant investment in the garage by implementing charges for
parking at this facility. Since the 600 spaces were reserved for RTD, the IGA requires that any such
parking plan receive approval in advance by the RTD Board of Directors in the Board’s sole discretion.
The IGA also specifies that a contingency financial plan should be developed by Aurora in the event a
proposed parking plan is not approved by the RTD Board. In the same spirit, the Iliff Garage Land lease
provided that the land upon which the parking structure is located will be leased to Aurora at no cost,

Packet Pg. 37

2.13.F

except that the parties shall address revenue generation issues as a part of a parking management plan
proposal.
In May 2016, the City of Aurora proposed terms for an Iliff Garage Parking Management Plan to RTD.
Aurora’s pro-forma analysis indicates that it is not likely that the City will break even before the third
year even in light of RTD’s O&M contribution and rent subsidy. During negotiations with RTD, Aurora
preferred to postpone discussion of revenue generation issues, effectively explaining that ridership
originating from Iliff Station needs a period of time to mature before any reliable revenue projections can
be made.
DISCUSSION
After consideration and negotiation, RTD staff agreed that the following principles for a parking
management plan with the City of Aurora (COA) for the Iliff Garage be submitted to the RTD Board of
Directors for consideration to cover this initial three year evaluation period as follows:


Term of Original Agreement: 3 years



Parking rates:
o COA shall implement an opening daily rate $3.00, with a not to exceed daily rate of $5.00
o COA shall implement a Monthly Reserved program, as defined below, with an opening rate
$50.00 not to exceed $85.00
o In order to achieve a utilization rate of at least 75% “average occupancy”, following an 18
month stabilization period, COA shall reduce first day parking rates below $3, including
reducing first day daily parking rates to $0 on an incremental basis. Monthly reserved parking
fees shall also be reduced to achieve 75% average occupancy if necessary. COA may choose
to reduce parking rates during the “stabilization period” if it deems conditions warrant. If first
day daily rates are reduced to $0.00 a second and subsequent day rate of at least $2.00 will
be retained, not to exceed 30 continuous days. Average occupancy is defined as occupancy
data collected over a one month period for weekday, working days only (holidays, weekends
excluded). Occupancy data will be collected during the midday timeframe to most accurately
reflect facility utilization. “Stabilization period” is defined as a timeframe not to exceed 18
months where parking rates would not be required to reduce in order to reach 75% average
occupancy in order for transit users to adjust travel habits and take advantage of the new
light rail transit service at Iliff Station.
o Rate changes: 60 day notice to RTD, Manager, Parking Management
o Overnight parking not to exceed 30 consecutive days.



Non-Transit Use of Transit Parking Spaces: Unless otherwise agreed by RTD in written form, 600
parking spaces shall be reserved for transit patron use at all times. On a case by case basis, RTD
agrees that the City of Aurora may plan to make use of unused transit parking space on evenings,
weekends and holidays to the extent that RTD does not anticipate RTD patron use of the Iliff
structure to access transit service during the proposed re-occurring periods or for scheduled events
and attractions at other transit served locations. The City of Aurora shall require a City Special Event
permit to be processed through the City Manager’s Office for each such proposed function at the Iliff
Garage 60 days prior to the proposed ongoing use or event. Each such City Special Event Permit
shall be subject to written approval by RTD. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and an
RTD approval decision shall be provided to the City of Aurora within 7 working days of receipt by
RTD from the City of Aurora.

Packet Pg. 38

2.13.F



Replacement Agreement: Six months prior to the parking management plan’s full term, COA and
RTD will begin good faith negotiations to negotiate a replacement agreement to be submitted to RTD
Board of Directors for consideration.



Payment Options: Iliff Garage will be equipped with pay stations that accept all forms of payment,
along with a pay by phone and online payment platforms for customers through Aurora’s contractor.



Monthly Reserved Parking: Commuters shall be able to purchase monthly permits for spaces that are
reserved within the parking structure garage for parking on weekdays starting at 5am. If not filled by
10am by subscribers, these spaces become open to the public in an effort to maximize utilization of
the facility. Overnight parking is not allowed in spaces reserved for monthly commuter parking. The
number of such spaces sold shall not exceed 50% of the capacity of the parking structure.



Customer Care: Aurora shall provide patrons of the Iliff parking facility with industry standard
customer care for inquiries, dissemination of public information, conduct of necessary business and
resolution of disputes.



Enforcement Procedures: Iliff Garage shall be enforced for non-payment and other prohibited
activities. Parkers issued citations shall have a dispute process available to them that is transparent
and accessible. Enforcement shall be overseen by Aurora Parking Enforcement and Aurora City
citations shall be issued to offenders. Parkers issued parking citations shall have the opportunity to
dispute their citation if they so choose with the Aurora Parking Bureau, as part of the Aurora
Municipal Court.



Garage Access: Iliff Garage shall employ a gateless, pay by plate system that is similar to RTD
managed parking facilities.



Reporting: On a Quarterly basis, the City shall provide RTD with all pertinent parking usage figures
for the Iliff Garage, including parking revenue and expense details fully disclosing the purposes for
which parking revenue and the annual RTD subsidy have been expended. These summaries shall be
due to RTD no later than the mid-point of each subsequent quarter.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This agreement will not alter RTD’s obligations under the Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA with Aurora
that requires an annual payment to Aurora of $94,500 in the first year escalated annually thereafter at
the rate of 2% compounded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the recommendation by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City
of Aurora for the utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms
outlined under Discussion in this Action.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action; rather, direct the General Manager to renegotiate the
terms and execute an IGA with Aurora with direction from the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the recommended action.

Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the Fall 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $785,800 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service reductions. Also included in this report is a
grant funded proposal anticipated to be implemented with the completion of North Central Park
Boulevard roadway construction. Funded through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate
between the Central Park Boulevard Station and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details
from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment C of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. Due to the relatively small number of proposals in the
Fall 2016 proposals, no significant changes are listed.

Packet Pg. 42

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 15 – East Colfax: adjust PM peak westbound frequency
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: new grant funded route service
Route 122X-Wagon Road/Civic Center: add a.m. peak trip
C Line: add earlier northbound weekday trip
E Line: add earlier northbound weekday trip
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: running time analysis
Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited: running time analysis
Route 88 – Thornton/Commerce City/Stapleton: running time analysis
Route AB – Boulder/DIA: schedule adjustments
BOLT _ Boulder/Longmont: conversion of selected peak trips to limited stop service
Federal Boulevard Routes: running time analysis
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $785,800 annualized, with
$442,000 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $343,800.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Fall 2016 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

the south and still cover this trip. This trip would depart Mineral Station at 4:42 AM and
arrive Denver Union Station at 5:10 AM. It is also proposed to add an earlier C Line
pullout trip by utilizing an existing out of service train that interlines to a W Line train.

AM.
E Line – Lincoln Station/Union Station

extended to depart Lincoln Station at 4:49 AM and a new trip would be added to depart

Jessie Carter conducted the meeting. There was 1 member of the public present and
David Sachs; with “Streetsblog Denver” who signed in.
Comment handed to Jessie Carter by Veronique Bellamy: “As a transit rider in Longmont, I
am angered that RTD is killing stops in Longmont making it harder for those who live near
Main Street or Ken Pratt to make their buses and will result in more walking. This is more
egregious on weekends, when Local Longmont service is poor.”
