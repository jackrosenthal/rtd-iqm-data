Description:
A representation of a first and last mile solution. This project will initially connect the 61st and Pena rail station to the Panasonic
building, an emerging apartment complex and the 61st and Pena park-n-ride…Potential Phase 2 may ultimately connect passengers
traveling between the 61st and Pena rail station and the 61st and Tower Road bus stop (approximately 4 blocks away).
Project Goals:
The “61AV Project” will utilize an AV shuttle to connect the 61st and Pena rail station with the nearby Panasonic building and the 61st
and Pena park-n-Ride…Possible Phase 2 may connect to the 61st and Tower bus stop. The project goals are as follows:
1. Safely introduce an autonomous vehicle on a public roadway in Denver
2. Assess the reliability and availability of an AV shuttle vehicle and its suitability for a transit application
3. Provide first/last mile service to/from an RTD bus/rail station
4. Align interests of all stakeholders/partners in order to advance the project

Rationale to Use MoD & Microtransit in Public Transit
Provide cost-effective services throughout the
District, but one size does not fit all.
• More cost-effective than bus in low density areas
• Jurisdictional equity
• Transit network integration
RTD FlexRide
Book online/mobile or call for on-demand or board without
reservation at stations; within geographic community; bus

• First/Last Mile – regular, reverse commute

Re:

Service Availability – March 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.03% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in March 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (March) last year. Service delivery has improved
significantly since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





March 2019 – 1,225.71 hours
March 2018 – 1,556.16 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 1,791.17 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 3,216.29 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in March were two (2) extreme winter weather
events extending over multiple days of operations (coldest/highest snow totals this year than
the last ten years), planned/unplanned shuttles (bus bridges), and special events (St. Patrick’s
Day Parade/Frozen Dead Guy Days). The two snow event days account for 987-hours of lost
service for personnel reasons on those two days alone.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.03% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,608 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 20,864 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.
