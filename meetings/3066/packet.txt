Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs

General

Board Meeting Date: December 1, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from
December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, with no change to the contract not-to-exceed amount.
Funding for this contract is included in the 2021 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the following General Manager’s goals:
Mission-oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
2021 Strategic Priority #4: Increase Ridership, Improve Rider Experience
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that brought the Contract Not-toExceed price up to $191,423,336.
In May 2017, the Board extended the contract completion date to December 31, 2019 without
increasing the contract price. At that time, the contract was amended to cover specific named
individuals and functional areas, with projected timeframes of availability for each one. In December
2018, the Board extended the contract completion date to December 31, 2020, and increased the
contract not-to-exceed amount to its current value of $192,623,336. This contract amendment would
not increase the contract value beyond the current authorized amount. Due to the hand-over of the NLine in September of this year, the additional work on the SERE project and final as-builds from the Eagle
and I-225, the survey and property effort had to be postponed until the completion of these activities. At
this time Jacob’s surveying and property team is completing needed record documents, survey and final
property transfer documents for the projects outlined below.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s
specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering, construction management support,
program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often part-time, basis.

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract originally was specified for a term of six years with a six-year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. In December 2018, the contract
end date was extended to the current end date of December 31, 2020.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where all the ongoing corridor projects have
reached revenue service and are in the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to finalize the
transactions and mapping that will secure the right-of-way for the program alignments, including survey
and mapping support for final acquisitions and utility relocations, post-construction surveys, and filing of
right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension to the Jacobs contract would make the resources
available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and cost-effective manner.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual was to leave Jacobs before
the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining hours for
that individual.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
• Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW), and
utility survey for all corridors and facilities.
North Metro
• Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
I-225
• Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Southeast Rail Extension
• Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
• Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The DBE report through September 2020
indicates that the PSC’s actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 18.94%. RTD does not foresee
any additional opportunities for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the
named roles are filled by Jacobs employees. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed
amount, the DBE participation on the overall contract would be approximately 18.6%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2021, would remain
at the currently authorized amount of $192,623,336 with this amendment. Funding for the remainder
of this contract is included in the 2021 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific
projects where PSC support would be utilized.

Results

Big Takeaway: Model Projects
a Notable Demand for Rail
After months of data-intensive work and many simulated runs, we found:
• There would be notable demand for rail service all along the Front Range.
• Demand is highest for commuters, but there’s also substantial demand for
recreation and special events.
• Front Range Passenger Rail ridership projections fare well when compared to
other successful intercity rail lines across the country.
• There would be real reductions in emissions and vehicle miles traveled.

Proposed Grant Program

2
Amtrak is proposing creation of a Network
Modernization Program (NMP) as part of our
reauthorization to support rail network
evolution and expansion, including efforts to
plan, develop, construct, and operate intercity
passenger rail service in high- potential shortdistance corridors like the Front Range.
As envisioned, the program would make
federal grant funds available to Amtrak to
cover up to 100% of the capital costs and
initial operating costs of new corridor service;
states would then gradually assume a greater
share of operating costs over a five-year
transition period. After this five-year period, if
the states want to continue service, long-term
costs would be allocated in accordance with
the existing Passenger Rail Investment and
Improvement Act (PRIIA) Sec. 209
methodology as currently used by many
states throughout the nation.
Existing Grants Continue
Amtrak intends for the NMP to supplement
existing grant opportunities (e.g., BUILD,
SOGR, CRISI, INFRA, & REG), and not to
replace them.

Unfinished

Information

This document provides a 2020 update to the “FasTracks Initial Unfinished Corridors Report” dated June
14, 2019, with a specific focus on: the current status of the FasTracks Financial Forecast; and a
Northwest Rail Peak Service BNSF / RTD Coordination Summary. The status of the remaining unfinished
FasTracks corridors remains substantially the same as reported in the referenced Report from 2019.
FasTracks Financial Forecast Update
In the June 14, 2019 “FasTracks Initial Unfinished Corridors Report”, RTD delineated ten different
funding scenarios as identified below. These 10 scenarios were developed based on the March 2019,
CU Leeds School of Business sales and use tax forecast. Since March 2019, RTD’s financial condition
has changed significantly. In March of 2020, RTD’s sales and use tax and fare box revenues decreased
significantly due to the impacts of COVID-19. The revenue forecast for September 2020 was much
better but was still down about 5% to 6%.
Due to the volatility of the revenues, the RTD Board of Directors has decided not to adopt a six-year plan
or long-range plan in 2020. As a result, we were not able to update the 10 scenarios based on the
current revenue forecasts. However, we did look at the current revenue forecast for 2021-2026 and
compared it to the last Mid-Term Financial plan adopted in 2019. It appears that the current revenue
forecast is at least $700 million less in 2021-2026 than the forecast used for the report last year. This
lower forecast may make many of the scenarios difficult to realize. RTD intends to update the six-year
and long-range financial forecasts in 2021.

Northwest Rail Peak Service BNSF / RTD Coordination Summary
BNSF / Stakeholder Meeting
On February 21, 2020, RTD Directors Lubow and Catlin, RTD staff and representatives from local
jurisdictions on the Northwest (NW) Rail alignment met with the BNSF at their Fort Worth headquarters
to discuss the potential for establishing peak-period passenger rail service in the Corridor. The proposed
service would provide three one-way train trips during the morning rush hour traveling from Longmont to
Union Station in Denver. During the afternoon rush hour, the service would provide three one-way trips
from Union Station back to Longmont. Representatives from the following local jurisdictions attended
the meeting:
•
•
•

Boulder County
City of Longmont
City of Westminster

At the meeting BNSF staff provided a presentation in response to questions previously posed by the
coalition. The presentation included information on the following items:
•
•
•
•

The assumptions used by BNSF to model the peak service proposal.
The capital improvements required to improve corridor travel time.
Positive Train Control (PTC) and Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) systems requirements
Potential siding (passing track) locations.

Other items noted by BNSF staff:

BNSF staff emphasized that their Commuter Principles state that, “No commuter rail operation can degrade
BNSF’s Freight service”. Accordingly, the modeling exercise had to mitigate the impacts of the three trains
passenger trains in the morning and three trains in the evening operating along the BNSF system (Westminster
Station to Longmont).
RTD would be responsible for constructing stations items such as boarding platforms and pedestrian crossings.
The corridor is an element of the BNSF core network; they have no intention of selling the corridor.
Their model indicates that the planned passenger service can work with their freight operations in the corridor –
provided the necessary infrastructure upgrades are implemented.

BNSF did not provide a cost estimate for capital or operations. In order to generate cost estimates,
BNSF staff would need to complete 30 percent engineering plans. BNSF agreed that the next steps
would be to provide RTD with a letter outlining the assumptions that have been used to date for their
modeling analysis.
BNSF Response Letter
BNSF provided RTD with a response letter dated May 15, 2020. The letter documented the modeling
assumptions discussed at the on February 21, 2020. Following is a summary of the key information
discussed in the letter.
Operational Assumptions
• Freight traffic numbers were determined by using 12 months of data culminating in January 2019.
• RTD passenger trains times should not exceed 67 minutes to travel the full length of the corridor from Longmont to
Union Station (52 minutes between Longmont and the existing Westminster Station).
• PTC and CTC would be installed to enhance safety for passenger train movements.
• BNSF infrastructure improvements would be required to meet RTD run time goals as well as fully mitigate the delay
impact to freight trains caused by the passenger trains.
Specific RTD Infrastructure Assumptions:
Stations would be constructed by RTD at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
•

88th Avenue, Westminster
116th Avenue, Broomfield
Flatiron, Broomfield
Downtown Louisville
Boulder Junction
Downtown Longmont

BNSF Infrastructure Assumptions:
•
•
•

Tracks would be upgraded to allow for higher speed limits.
Existing sidings at Boulder and Broomfield would be upgraded to allow for freight train movements.
Addition of four new sidings ranging from approximately 6,500 to 9,000 feet in length at the following locations
would be constructed:
o Westminster – 92nd Avenue to 105th Avenue
o Louisville – Pine Street to Baseline Road
o Boulder – North of Arapahoe Avenue, 62nd Street to 48th Street
o Boulder, Gunbarrel – 55th Street to 63rd Street.

Packet Pg. 30

1.D.1

Overall summary:
•
•

The infrastructure improvements described above would allow RTD trains to complete runtimes of approximately 61
to 63 minutes for the full corridor from Union Station to Longmont.
The infrastructure improvements would mitigate delays to BNSF freight trains caused by RTD passenger trains for
approximately ten years (assuming a 2 percent annual growth rate in freight traffic).

Next Steps
If BNSF is to move forward with preparing a cost-estimate for the corridor, RTD would have to enter into
a design agreement with BNSF whereby RTD would fund the cost of preparing the design documents.
BNSF has not yet determined what the full cost for that effort would be.
2020 Updated Northwest Rail Ridership Forecasts
In August 2020, RTD staff prepared an update to the NW Rail Corridor ridership forecasts. Based on
continued stakeholder interest in exploring the possibility of grant funding support through the Federal
Transit Administration’s Section 5309 Capital Investment Grant (New Starts) program, RTD staff tested
a potential enhancement to the corridor’s competitiveness for New Starts funding by increasing the rail
project’s capture of ridership in the general travel market.
This test was run using DRCOG’s modeling platform and land use projections for the “Opening” (current
year) and 2040 “Horizon” years. Note that DRCOG’s model includes all of the RTD District and includes
projections for southwest Weld county. So, while it includes the vast majority of the potential travel
market for the NW Rail Corridor, trips coming from outside the DRCOG modeling area (such as Loveland,
Ft. Collins, Greeley) are not captured in the transit demand forecasts. To prepare the forecasts, RTD
staff assumed the following:
•
•
•

55 one-way rail trips per weekday as follows:
o every half-hour from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and between 3:30 PM and 6:30 PM
o hourly service during remaining hours, with a service span between 4:00 AM and midnight;
Termination of all Flatiron Flyer routes; and
Re-routing of all Flatiron Flyer local bus service connections to instead connect to the NW Rail stations.

The results are show below, labeled “Without FF.” We have also shown the previous model runs for
comparison purposes:

This test is based on the abandonment of Flatiron Flyer services, making NW Rail service the primary
transit option within the Corridor. The resulting ridership forecasts are higher in this test scenario
compared with ridership forecasts for the NW Rail Corridor when operating in concert with existing
Flatiron Flyer services. Note, however, that the breakpoint for a New Starts Medium Cost Effectiveness
rating is $9.99 or better (i.e. lower than $9.99). At $26.62, the project still would not meet minimum
project justification criteria for FTA funding in the competitive New Starts grant program.
