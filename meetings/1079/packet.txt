Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2012

Subject:

Approval of Contract Extension - Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a month
to month contract extension to Idea Integration for an extension for the amount not to exceed of
$76,000 to provide Graphical Information Systems (GIS) consulting services. The contract is being
brought to the Board because it is a Personal Services contract per RTD Resolution No.27, Series of
1985.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Idea Integration in 2010 following a competitive bid of four submitted
proposals and candidate interviews. Idea Integration is a certified Environmental Systems Research
Institute's (ESRI) Corporate Consultant.
RTD provides mission critical GIS enterprise systems that must be maintained and continually enhanced.
GIS skilled consultants maintain the systems allowing 24x7 access to RTD’s critical GIS information
assets. These systems require ongoing maintenance and operations activities to ensure application
integrity and reliability. For example the GIS systems database contains the base maps used by the
Trapeze scheduling applications to plan all of RTD routes as well as for our new trip planner, parking
management, and CAD/AVL system. Without GIS development contract support, RTD would not be
able to operate and advance current public applications and systems.
DISCUSSION
This contracted support is critical for the on-going GIS administration of GIS System Map applications,
West Corridor Web Map, Internet Trip Planner, Parking Management System, FasTracks System Maps
and Trapeze interfaces. GIS will play a key role in establishing requirements for “real time” information
applications with the new CAD/AVL system. With an increase in GIS needs, this resource was approved
to be sourced as an internal employee. The contract provides a part time fixed level of weekly support
as well as 24/7 on-call resources to address critical failures until the new position is filled.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District for the extension of contracted GIS services from Idea Integration for 600 billable
hours over a four-month period will not exceed $76,000. Sufficient funding has been included in the
Information Technology 2013 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 3

2.1

1. Approve the option to extend the contract for part time GIS Consulting Services. This is the
recommended action for the following reasons:
 Enables IT to maintain the current level of GIS Administration in support of Parking Management,
Internet, and Service Planning and Scheduling critical operations.
 Positions IT to move forward with required GIS applications to support future mobile and real time
applications, an improved trip planner, automated stop announcements, our new CAD/AVL
system, Fastracks and West Corridor GIS needs.
2. Do not approve the GIS Consulting Services part time contract extension. This is not the
recommended action for the following reasons:
 Capacity to adequately support the application production operations may be severely
compromised. RTD may need to reduce the 24/7 requirement for support.
 West Corridor on-line web maps would not be available to the public.
 Without key and unique skills that are not available through staff may possibly diminish the
functional performance level of the GIS and associated systems.
 Compromises the ability to configure new GIS systems and maintain compliance with GIS servers
for security and upgrades to the GIS development tools.
 Defer future upgrades and additional applications services until such time that IT can prioritize
current and future GIS project demands.

Bond Rating Agency Update for Sales Tax
Revenue Bonds Series 2012A

BACKGROUND:
Rating agency presentations were held at RTD offices in November for Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.
The agencies were asked to provide a rating for the 2012A sales tax bonds that RTD is in the process of
issuing and RTD informed the agencies that RTD will be asking for a rating on the district’s Certificates of
Participation (COP’s) in January 2013 when RTD anticipates issuing new COP’s. In addition to the
presentations given by the Finance Division, the agencies were given a tour of Denver Union Station. All three
agencies seemed impressed by the construction activity at the station.
DISCUSSION:
Revenue BondsThe following credit ratings / rating outlooks for the 2012A FasTracks revenue bonds have been received:
Standard & Poor’s:
Moody’s:
Fitch:

Prior Rating
AA+ / Stable
Aa2 / Stable
AA / Stable

New Rating
AA+ / Stable
Aa2 / Stable
AA / Stable

The ratings assigned to the bonds affirmed the ratings of previously issued parity FasTracks revenue bonds
and the TIFIA Loan.

Certificates of ParticipationWhile reviewing the credit rating for the sales tax revenue bonds, Fitch took a global look at RTD’s outstanding
debt. When considering the credit rating previously issued on RTD’s Certificates of Participation at AA-, Fitch
concluded that the planned issuance of the series 2012A revenue bonds would necessitate a downgrade of the
outstanding COP’s as shown in the following table.
Standard & Poor’s:
Moody’s:
Fitch:

Prior Rating
A- / Stable
Aa3 / Stable
AA- / Stable

New Rating
N/A
N/A
A+ / Negative

The downgrade from AA- to A+ puts RTD’s COP rating in the middle of Fitch’s investment grade credit rating
scale.
Key drivers for Fitch’s rating:

Packet Pg. 5

3.1

“The downgrade of the COPs to 'A+' from 'AA-' reflects their growing exposure to projected thinning financial
margins amidst RTD's aggressive expansion plan. As an operating expense of the base system, COPs base
rental payments are paid after all other system debt service, which is increasing notably with the current
offering.”
“RTD's service area is large and diverse but exhibits cyclicality as evidenced by the ongoing recovery of sales
tax revenues which declined significantly in 2009.”
“The sizable capital plan has been reprioritized to accommodate rising FasTracks costs and revenue shortfalls.
Such pressures have spurred management to pursue innovative methods to leverage its constrained
resources, which Fitch believes could result in increased risk to the overall debt structure.”
“Including the current offering, debt service coverage by pledged sales tax revenue remains satisfactory due to
rebounding revenue trends. However, Fitch notes that planned COP issuances may result in diminished
margins above RTD's minimum 1.2 times (x) net revenue coverage requirement for all debt obligations. This
policy, which Fitch considers an important credit feature, has served to limit RTD's exposure to revenue
volatility and budgetary contingencies.”
“RTD has a history of optimistic sales tax revenue projections but responds effectively with mid-year
adjustments when needed. Sales tax performance relative to system operating and capital needs will remain
an important rating driver.”

Third Quarter 2012 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter 2012. These year-to-date measures provide a
framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District. Of the 22 performance measures tracked, RTD met 16 of the goals in their entirety in the
third quarter. The following are the exceptions:
Goal 1.1 – Veolia and First Transit in Q3 exceeded the goal for number of passenger accidents per
100,000 miles. An unusual number of accidents were reported in Q1, incurred during January and
February inclement weather. Veolia and First Transit are using DriveCam and Smart Drive technologies
to help operators improve/correct driving practices. Both contractors are providing Smith System
retraining to all of their operators. In Q2 and Q3, many of the accidents were determined to be nonpreventable.
Goal 2.1 – The number of graffiti-related complaints increased in Q3 and these complaints are being
addressed. Average facilities maintenance complaints per month exceeded the goal in Q3 primarily due
to Q1 complaints about snow/ice and shelter clean-up from snow, and several instances where shelters
have a one-time per week maintenance schedule. Complaints declined in Q2 and the trend is continuing
downward in Q3. It should be noted that the new manager responsible for this area has developed a
more accurate tracking system which has resulted in capturing more customer complaints.
Goal 3.1 – The District did not meet its goal for on-time service in Q3. While we experienced
improvements from Q2 for RTD Local, Veolia, and FT-Longmont, we experienced slight declines in FTCommerce City, FT-Denver and LRT on-time performance. Regional and Express Service was flat to Q2
while continuing to generate large increases in ridership which increase dwell time. Staff continues to
study individual route and driver performance in order to target remedial actions and resources to the
routes experiencing the greatest challenges.
LRT on-time performance was slightly below goal in the Q3 due to: 1) almost 40 new train operators
adjusting to complex downtown operations, including navigating critical timing junctions in the
downtown area where timing is critical at 19th between California and Stout and along Welton, 2)
continuing traffic signal timing problems at 7th, 9th, and Kalamath streets causing system delay which
is a City of Denver issue, and 3) the traction power substation (TPSS) software upgrade which has
resulted in multiple substations being off line, preventing trains from accelerating to full power so they
can achieve permissible speeds in these areas. We expect resolution in the coming months.

Packet Pg. 7

3.2

Goal 3.3 – Mileage between lost service road calls was met by all carriers in Q3 except Veolia.
Although Veolia continues to fall short of the goal, performance in this area continues to improve from
prior quarters, which indicates that progress is being made with the new management team. We expect
this measurement will be restored to goal in due course.
Goal 4.2 – We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system due to several factors
including the fare enforcement campaign, increasing ridership, and heavy/longer load times. Top reasons
continue to be “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues
to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators
to address valid complaints. Staff has provided an analysis of complaints as part of the
Operations/Customer Service report.
Goal 7.1 – As of Q3, the District did not meet its goal of three Local Government Planning Workshops.
This is an annual goal, however, and the first meeting occurred in August with the second meeting
scheduled for October and the third for December.

Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff has provided
an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire
system in 2011 due to the fare enforcement campaign, implementation of the stroller policy and the posting of Title VI signs; this
higher level of complaints has not receded while the volume of complaints overall is not increasing.
