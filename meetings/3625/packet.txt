March 2024 Sales and Use Tax Forecast

April 16, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and Five-year Financial Plan.
The provision of the Forecast Model Report is followed by a presentation to the Board by CU Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The August 2023 sales and use tax forecast was included in the 2024 Budget. The attached March
2024 Forecast Model Report reflects a change from the August 2023 forecast in RTD’s sales and use
taxes as follows:

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Strong economic fundamentals, particularly rising employment, income, and wealth, continued to
support economic growth in 2023 and into 2024. While national consumption has been resilient
despite low savings, high inflation, and high interest rates, nominal retail sales growth did slow in
2023, and are expected to remain slow in 2024. Colorado retail activity slowed ahead of the nation,
and is expected to underperform in 2024 before rebounding in 2025, contributing to slower shortterm sales and use tax revenue for RTD. Following retail normalization in 2023 and 2024, growth
rates rebound in the medium-term forecast.
Figure 1

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•

•
•

•

The U.S. economy has proved resilient despite high (but improving) inflation and high
interest rates. GDP, employment, and income continue to grow. Inflation reported in the
Consumer Price Index slowed from 8% in 2022 to 4.1% in 2023, and 3.2% in February 2024.
Other economic conditions continue to indicate expansion: employment growth, wage
growth, personal income, consumption, and retail sales.
Moody’s Analytics projects real (inflation-adjusted) GDP to increase 2.5% in 2024 and 1.5%
in 2025 in the baseline scenario. National retail sales are projected to grow 2.5% in 2024—
the slowest rate since 2020, suppressed in part by elevated inflation, low savings, slower job
growth, and modest real wage growth.
Nationally and locally, employment continued to post new record levels in 2023, and 2024 is
projected to sustain job growth. Colorado employment grew 2.5% in 2023 (11th-fastest). Job
growth continued in January, up 2%, or 57,900 jobs, ranking the state 16th for the pace of
growth. Colorado had the 4th-highest labor force participation rate in the country in January
and the 29th-fastest labor force growth rate.

RTD sales and use tax revenue declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but rebounded
19.6% in 2021 to total $757 million, and grew 13% in 2022 to total $855 million. Revenue
growth slowed in 2023 to 0.3%, to total $858.1 million. Revenue is projected to accelerate to
2.9% in 2024.
The Q3 and Q4 2023 revenue was squarely within the confidence bound presented in August
2023.
Colorado employment is projected to increase 1.6% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. Personal
income less transfer payments continue to outperform the nation.
The national unemployment rate increased to 3.9% in February 2024, indicating slight
loosening in the tight labor market. The unemployment rate in Colorado was 3.4% in January
2024.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The 67% upperand lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind economic conditions that
pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast. The mean forecast for 2024 of
$883 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $828 million on the low side and
$937 million for the upper bound. The mean forecast for 2025 is $931 million, with a lower
bound of $851 million and an upper bound of $1 billion.
A potential downside risk to the short-term revenue growth is the sharp increase in
residential property taxes that takes effect in 2024, which could suppress discretionary
disposable personal income spent on taxable goods in the District.
Other headwinds include a “cliff” of commercial real estate loans coming due in 2025, which
eventually will result in markdowns for regional banks; and household credit delinquencies;
and depleted housing savings.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 77
times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.96%.
RTD Government Relations reported no pending or recently enacted legislation that would
have a direct impact on RTD sales and use tax collection as of March 18, 2024.

Medium-Term Outlook
•

Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.

Short-Term Outlook

1.C.1.b

•

•

•
•

Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 32.6%
between 2023 and 2030, reaching $1.14 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon. The
March 2024 medium-term forecast is lower than the August 2023 forecast.
A more optimistic scenario, under which the national economy experiences faster growth,
yields cumulative revenues 3.3% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon; however, the 2030 total is 3.4% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 5.4% below the baseline scenario.
Climate change is a direct assumption within the Moody’s Analytics scenario. According to
Moody’s, “The baseline forecast includes climate change assumptions that are consistent
with a weighted average of the assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including
those from the Network for Greening the Financial System.”

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After average annual revenue growth rates of 4.8% for the decade ending in 2020 (in
current, nominal dollars), revenue projections for the next three decades average 6.1%
(2021–2030), 3.8% (2031–2040), and 2.1% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.3% (2021–
2050).
The long-term forecast increased from the August 2023 update.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2024), medium term (2030), and long term (2050).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.
The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the BRD
research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data is available through January 2024; state retail sales and state taxable sales are
available through December 2023; and District taxable sales are available through December 2023.
Data after these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue from medical and retail marijuana
sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap
year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As
such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana
taxes. Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. The category was merged with All Other General
Merchandise Stores in 2022. This broader category represented 8.5% of the total sales taxes
collected in 2023.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020, recording year-over-year losses for nine months in 2020. RTD posted
growth of 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, but revenue growth slowed sharply in 2023 to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to remain modest in 2024 with growth of 2.9%, before accelerating to 5.4% in
2025.
All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in February 2024, with much of the data current through 2023. RTD revenue data were
provided through January 2024, and state retail sales and taxable sales data were current through
December 2023. All reported data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show an economy that continues to grow. The
unemployment rate signaled a continued tight labor market in 2022 and 2023, averaging 3.1% and
3.2%, respectively. The rate is projected to increase in 2024 to 3.5%, and in 2025 to 3.6%. Personal
income growth surged during the pandemic recession due to fiscal stimulus, and growth continued
in 2022 (6.3%) and 2023 (4.7%) as components of income reached record levels (e.g., wage and
salary income, proprietor income). Moderate nominal income growth is projected in the short-term,
but real income growth will be comparatively lower due to inflation. The Denver-Aurora-Lakewood
consumer price index grew at a faster pace than the nation for most of the past decade. Consumer
price growth peaked in 2022 and slowed to 5.2% in 2023. and is projected to gravitate lower in 2024
and 2025.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020 but increased 20% in

2021 and 13.7% in 2022. District taxable retail sales slowed rapidly in 2023 to 1%, but are projected
to rebound in 2024 to 3%. Sales tax revenues change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020; rebounding
19.8% in 2021 and 13.2% in 2022; and slowing to 0.8% in 2023. Revenue is projected to increase 3%
in 2024 and 4.6% in 2025. Note that the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana revenue)
to impute taxable retail sales in the seven-county RTD district because retail marijuana is no longer
assessed at the 2.9% retail sales tax rate for the state. However, retail marijuana is taxed 1% for the
special districts, leading to a difference in taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
those purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases
at the same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but
increased 7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in
2020. Use taxes rebounded in 2021 and 2022, increasing 17% and 9.7%, but fell 5.8% in 2023. The
forecast calls for modest growth in 2024 (1.9%) and strong growth in 2025 (16.8%). The volatility of
use taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2025. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $828 million and as
high as $937 million for 2024. The 2024 lower and upper bounds range -6.2% to +6% relative to the
medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2025 with greater uncertainty. The 2025 upperand lower-bound estimates are -8.5% and +8.4% different than the medium baseline forecast,
showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic that
revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2030. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the Baseline macroeconomic scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total

Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 37.1% increase from
2023-2030. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
through 2027, then converges. In the second alternative, in which the economy grows more slowly in
the short run, there is a 32.6% increase between 2023 and 2030, with slower growth recorded in the
first two years. The differences in the cumulative revenue from 2023 to 2030 illustrate the impact of
slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces cumulative (2023-2030)
revenue $237 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic scenario produces cumulative
revenue $385 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios allow for a reasonable
degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy and may be taken as plausible
bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2030. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
Moody’s “Baseline Forecast” represents a baseline estimate for the U.S. economy, constructed with
a 50% probability that the economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will
underperform.
This scenario assumes that the economy continues to operate at full employment in the short-term.
The Fed, in this scenario, is expected to decrease interest rates three times in 2024. The U.S.
government averts a shutdown. Oil prices remained unchanged in the short term.
Climate change is embedded in the Moody’s scenario. According to Moody’s, “The baseline forecast
includes climate change assumptions that are consistent with a weighted average of the
assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including those from the Network for Greening the
Financial System.”
Real GDP is expected to grow 2.5% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. Inflation rose 8% in 2022 and 4.1% in
2023. The CPI is projected to increase 2.8% in 2024. Employment growth is projected to slow to 1.4%
in 2024 and 0.5% in 2025.

Despite the recession, Colorado retail sales grew 4.9% in 2020 and 17% in 2021. Growth remained
strong in 2022 (9.6%) but slowed sharply in 2023 (1.3%). Accelerating growth is projected for 2024
(2%) and 2025 (4.5%); the simple average of 3.7% is projected for the medium-term forecast
horizon. In the medium-term forecast, state retail sales growth outperforms the nation many years
of the forecast period.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 5.6% in 2024. The annual average
unemployment rate in 2024 increases to 3.5% for the year, and total employment grows 1.6%. The
employment rebound surpassed the prior peak in early 2022. With rebounding employment and
wages, elevated wealth and savings, as well as elevated inflation, nominal retail sales continue to
advance.

RTD use tax revenue fell 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020 but rebounded 17% in 2021 and 9.7% in
2022. Use taxes decreased in 2023 by 5.8%, illustrating the volatility of this series. A modest increase
is projected in 2024 (1.9%), followed by 16.8% growth in 2025. Simple average growth of 5.6% is
projected over the medium-term forecast horizon through 2030. With 90% of RTD tax revenues
coming from sales taxes, the yearly changes in total revenues closely track those for sales tax
revenues.

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside” represents an optimistic scenario constructed with a 10%
probability that the economy will perform better and a 90% probability that it will underperform.
Scenario 1 forecasts a rise in consumer sentiment with the strong labor market. Some global risks
dimmish in this scenario. Inflation rates and interest rates remain elevated due to the strong
economy.
Real GDP grows 3.3% in 2024 and 3% in 2025. The unemployment rate improves to an average of
3.4% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2024. Retail sales are projected to accelerate in 2024 and 2025 in this
scenario.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 32.6% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2023 to 2030. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
11.7% in RTD revenues for the 2023−2030 forecast period and a 52.9% increase in the high-range
forecast.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside” is constructed with a 90% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. This scenario assumes
that bank failures lead to reduced consumer confidence and tighter lending standards, and that the
risk of government shutdown rises. In this scenario, GDP falls, unemployment spikes, and inflation
eases. The global economy underperforms due to elevated tensions between China and Taiwan and
the persistence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading to supply chain issues.
The combination of these presumptions leads the U.S. economy into recession in Q2 2024, which
lasts for three quarters. The weakened economy leads to a rise in the unemployment rate. Real GDP
falls by 0.6% in 2025 and begins to rebound in 2026.

Historical data.

In this pessimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $1.1 billion in 2030, which is 2.3% below
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields negative revenue growth
through 2025, then faster growth rates that exceed the baseline projections through 2030. Total
revenues grow by 29.6% between 2023 and 2030. Cumulative revenues from 2023-2030 are 5.4%
below, or $385 million lower than the baseline scenario.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
In the Baseline scenario, RTD revenue grows 32.6% to $1.14 billion in the medium term (through
2030). The pessimistic scenario presents slower growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by
faster growth, growing to $1.11 billion by 2030, netting 29.6% growth over the period. The
optimistic scenario records growth that results in an increase of 37.1% over the period, to $1.18
billion, outperforming growth early in the forecast horizon.

The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 5.8% in 2030, but the cumulative
revenue differences are 9.3% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: Coming off a lower base for 2020 but a much stronger 2021 and 2022, the March 2024
long-term forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in
the final decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar)
terms are projected to grow by 4.0% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth
rate is 1.3%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% in 2010 to 43.7% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output
between now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 45.1% by 2050.
However, total population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real
output growth rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–
2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison

with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2030.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rates of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next two

Moody’s model projects 2.1% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Tables 23 and 24 report rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounded for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly lower than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth,
primarily during the 2020s and 2030s. During the final decade Colorado retail trade growth rate
underperforms the U.S. rate of growth. Negative growth rate for RTD taxable sales during the final
decade reflects the persistent slowdown in total population growth in Colorado, and especially in
the district.

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in
Appendix A.

Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 6.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The
pattern of growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that
of retail sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast (2.1% for RTD)
being the weakest for all three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the

Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through January 2024, allowing for error
evaluation through the fourth quarter of 2023. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have
been above the actual revenue 77 times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple
average of the error has been -0.96%, with a 4.45% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue
swings during the pandemic recession). The September 2023 forecast for Q3 and Q4 2023 were high
by 0.1% and 3.7%, respectively, illustrating the slowdown in Colorado ahead of the national retail
environment. The 2024 forecast was revised down in March 2024, as were the medium-term
forecasts. The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars ending in 2050 was revised up
from the September forecast.

Figure 7

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2024-2025), medium term (2030), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the
previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables (the @SEAS( ) terms), but only 3 of these were found to
have statistically significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the
other key variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model
previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such

terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 8

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s forecasts of
national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term Colorado Economy
Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national variables for the longterm forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for converting forecasts of
real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation had an impact on the RTD forecast. The real-dollar RTD forecast is constructed as
nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous decade, the
inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually. Market disruptions and supply-chain

discord create additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. While price growth improved
prices have been stuck at around 3% for several months.

A combination of factors has continued to elevate inflation in the economy, some of which are
easing:
•

A disrupted supply chain that is imposing supply shortages and bottlenecks in final consumer
products as well as inputs to production.

•

Excess savings by households remain above pre-pandemic levels, but higher costs of
borrowing, high inflation, and negative real wage growth causing consumers to spend down
savings and reduce savings rates.

•

Volatile commodity prices. Several staple commodities showed easing prices in 2023,
eventually reflected in consumer prices.

•

Tight labor markets. The economy swung from a very loose labor market during the
pandemic to one of the tightest labor markets in history. As labor markets have tightened,
wages have increased, but not to the extent to keep consumers on par with price increases.
Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor to inflation. National and state
unemployment rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels, and many businesses face
difficulties finding qualified and willing workers, and this should place continued pressure on
employers to increase wages, especially for low wage workers.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual U.S. inflation that rose to 8% in 2022 and
4.1% in 2023, and a Denver metro area inflation rate of 8% in 2022 and 5.2% in 2023. The BRD team
will continue to monitor the situation and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence
emerges to suggest changing inflation expectations.

National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.

•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures allocated to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of
goods and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI
component that fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail
sales. This variable is included in the current specification of some equations in the

forecasting model. The CPI is also used to convert between nominal and real values of
personal income and retail sales.
Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag in the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Because the survey only asks for total wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the
month, we cannot see an alternative method for obtaining monthly data by county. This
survey solicits information from the employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence,
so some wages leak out of the Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of
Colorado are sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources:
Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modeled and forecast
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.
The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three

treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2023–2030 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier

determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of
this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2023 and showed slower net migration to the state and the district.
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.

sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the retired and working populations as they affect income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratio increases throughout the forecast horizon, but Colorado and the
district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2045 followed by further decline to 2050.

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of the Economy

Summary: The U.S. economy continued to post strong growth in 2023. The economy appears poised
to show slower GDP growth while supporting further job growth. Colorado real GDP increased 3.4%
year-over-year in Q3 2023, and at an annualized rate of 5.8% from Q2 to Q3. National and Colorado
employment continued to reach new heights in 2023. However, elevated inflation and high interest
rates pose headwinds.
Gross Domestic Product
When determining whether an economy is under a recession, factors considered include real
personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the
household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price
changes, and industrial production. The recent pandemic recession was officially marked by the
National Bureau of Economic Research as the shortest U.S. recession (two months) dating back to
the mid-1800s when dating recessions began, and now the economy has remained in expansion for
nearly four years and counting. National real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
(SAAR) of 2% in Q1 2023, 2.4% in Q2, 4.9% in Q3, and 3.2% in Q4. Personal consumption
expenditures showed resiliency, increasing 3.8%, 0.8%, 3.1%, and 3%, respectively, over the same
period. Growth was recorded among both goods and services. Gross private fixed investment
decreased 9% in Q1 but posted strong growth beginning in Q2; and the subcomponent of residential
fixed investment also started to post gains beginning in Q3 after decreasing for nine consecutive
quarters. Government consumption recorded strong growth throughout the year, and the trade
deficit shrank. GDP is expected to increase in 2024 and 2025.
In Q3 2023 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP increased at an annualized rate of 5.8%
quarter-over-quarter (ranked 10th) and 3.4% year-over-year (ranked 19th).

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

National consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, has generally been on the
rise since hitting a low point in July 2022. In February 2024, the index was 3.3 points higher than in
February 2023, and 5.7 points higher than November 2023 (one quarter prior). Concerns about
inflation remain, particularly food and gas prices. As well, respondents also noted concern about the
labor market situation and politics. The Mountain Region index remained above the national index,
but it also is generally more volatile than the national index.
Figure 19: Index of Consumer Confidence

Jobless Claims
National initial jobless claims totaled 209,000 the week of March 9, 2024, a decrease from the same
period in 2023. National continued claims were up year-over-year. Colorado’s jobless claims have
seen a slight jump in the beginning of 2024 over the prior years but have already begun to settle.
The 2,732 initial jobless claims filed the week ending March 2, 2024 were up 2.1% year-over-year,
but remained 15% below the all-time average. Continued claims in the state also rose year-overyear, up 15.4%, and remained just below the all-time average.

Employment and Wages

Figure 21: United States Employment, Total Jobs

The national unemployment rate increased from 3.6% in February 2023 to 3.9% in February 2024,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in Colorado increased to 3.4% in
January 2024, tying the state for the 24th-lowest unemployment rate in the nation. The rate
increased from 3% in January 2023.
Colorado added 72,300 jobs in 2023—the 6th-best job growth year since 2000. The number of jobs in
Colorado totaled 2.9 million. The state is projected to add another 42,000 jobs in 2024, a slower
absolute number and rate of change, according to the Colorado Business Economic Outlook. Wages
in Colorado’s private sector grew 4.2% year-over-year in 2023.

U.S. job growth averaged 606,000 per month in 2001 and 399,000 in 2022 as the economy recouped
jobs lost from the pandemic recession, making it back to peak employment in 2022. The U.S.
continued to add jobs in 2023, adding an average of 251,000 jobs per month, which segued into
strong growth to start 2024—an average of 252,000 jobs were added per month in January and
February.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

By industry, the most jobs added are projected in Professional and Business Services, Government,
and Education and Health Services. By rate of change, the fastest pace of growth is projected in
Natural Resources and Mining. Financial Activities, Information, Manufacturing, and Construction
are all at risk for job losses in 2024.

There have also been continued struggles to fill record numbers of job openings. While job openings
have generally decreased over the past year, they remain high, totalling nearly 8.9 million openings
in January 2024, a year-over-year decrease of 15%. The number of quits, while decreasing 12.8%
year-over-year, also remains at high with nearly 3.4 million in January 2024. Colorado’s job openings
rate of 6.6% ranked the state 4th in December 2023. The state reportedly had 207,000 job openings
and 107,597 unemployed individuals in December, resulting in a ratio of 1.9 job openings per
unemployed person in the state.

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado’s value of construction decreased 11.2% in 2023 compared to the same
period in 2022. The greatest decrease was recorded in the residential sector. Nonresidential also
recorded a modest decline while nonbuilding (infrastructure) increased.

Residential real estate prices in Colorado continued to grow in Q4 2023. The most recent data from
the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show that home prices in
Colorado increased 2.3% year-over-year in Q4 2023, but decreased 1.2% quarter-over-quarter.
Colorado’s MSAs show mostly increasing prices year-over-year and decreasing quarter-over-quarter
changes.

Colorado residential permits decreased 14% in 2022 and 19% in 2023, for a total decline of 30% from
2021-2023. The 2-year decline in single family building outpaced the decline in multifamily, 35% to
25%.

Inflation
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) – All Items increased
3.2% in February 2024 year-over-year. Core inflation, which includes all items less food and energy,
increased 3.8% year-over-year. Denver-Aurora-Lakewood recorded slightly higher price growth
(3.5% all items, 4.1% core) in January 2024 (most current) as the region recorded notably higher
housing and transportation price growth.

Colorado retail and food services sales increased 1.4% in 2023. Colorado’s sales and use tax
collections increased 2.8% in 2023. Comparing taxable retail sales in 2023 to the same period in
2022, state taxable sales increased 2.4%. Comparatively, taxable sales were up 2.3% in the RTD
district area.

E-Commerce
E-commerce sales continue to expand at a relatively rapid rate. As technology advances through
tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and access the
nation’s e-commerce landscape. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a short-term spike in ecommerce activity, there has been a notable long-term adoption of the sales channel that pre-dates

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession. The team leveraged a U.S. macroeconomic scenario titled, “S4:
Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96% Percentile”, which is constructed with a 96% probability
that the economy will outperform this projection and a 4% probability that the economy will
underperform. Economic growth is slowed by tight financial conditions, the risk of a government
shutdown, elevated interest rates, and heightened geopolitical tensions.
Real GDP grows 0.3% in 2024 and falls 2.6% in 2025 before rebounding in 2026; the medium-term
average is 1.5%. The unemployment rate increases to an average of 6.1% in 2024 and 8.5% in 2025.
Retail sales turn negative in 2024 and 2025 before returning to moderate growth.
In this recession scenario, RTD revenue grow falls in 2024 (-4.9%) and 2025 (-3.3) before returning to
growth. After 2025, growth ranges between 4.7% and 8.2% in the medium-term horizon.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Mobile Ticketing and Account-based Ticketing Contract
Extension

April 16, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
April 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a two-year contract extension with Masabi, LLC (Masabi) to
continue providing the software and support necessary for the mobile ticketing and account-based
ticketing (ABT) fare collection system.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In October 2020, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the mobile ticketing contract with
Masabi, 16DH050, to provide the software and support necessary for adding account-based ticketing
(ABT) functionality. Masabi implemented ABT enhancing the RTD Mobile Ticketing app (now branded the
RTD MyRide app) and activating back-office software functionality in its JustRide platform for fare
payment with stored value, CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass. Masabi also implemented
integrations with RTD’s bus computer aided dispatch/automatic vehicle location (CAD/AVL) system, as
well as for the University of Colorado, Boulder and the Auraria Higher Education Center. Use of Masabi’s
JustRide platform for mobile ticketing and ABT has been successful, and Masabi has proven to be a
competent and responsive vendor.
Mobile ticketing is a convenient fare payment method that has proven to be highly popular with RTD
customers. Customers can purchase RTD mobile tickets in the RTD MyRide app and, through
integrations by Masabi, also in the Transit and Uber apps. In addition, employers, organizations, and
event organizers can issue mobile tickets to riders in bulk.
ABT functionality allows customers to use RTD’s services with stored value as well as CollegePass,
EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass. The system processes and stores information by account, while
ensuring Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, and allows for such benefits as:
• Real-time loading and availability of funds and fare payment and account balance information
• Tap-to-ride functionality
• Fare capping (customers are automatically charged the most cost-efficient fare)
• The ability to use barcodes and other fare media in addition to cards
• The ability for multiple customers to use the fund balance in the same account

1.E.1

•
•
•

Varied means of loading stored value
More fare offerings and flexibility in changing fares
Less maintenance through utilization of a hosted environment

Employers, colleges, and neighborhoods can manage pass program users, barcodes, and cards in the
Justride system. The Masabi fare collection system is scalable and allows for modifications such as the
recent implementation of fare changes resulting from the 2022-23 Systemwide Fare Study and Equity
Analysis. This system also provides flexibility regarding potential future fare structure changes and
enhancements as well as compatibility with other electronic fare collection systems such as ticket
vending machines, and the capability to integrate with other third-party systems.
The Masabi contract currently requires a fixed monthly payment of $150,000 for ongoing use of the
JustRide platform for mobile ticketing and account-based ticketing and support. These costs are
approximately 4% to 5% of associated fare revenue, which is comparable to costs incurred with other
fare collection providers in the industry. In addition, payment transactions that are completed with a
credit or debit card through the Masabi system also result in an additional cost of approximately 4.7% of
card sales, which is paid to banks and card processing networks such as Visa and Mastercard and
passed through at cost from Masabi to RTD.
DISCUSSION
Staff presented this proposed contract extension as a Discussion Item during the Tuesday, March 12,
2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting.
A sole-source extension of this contract with Masabi would continue the provision of the JustRide
mobile ticketing and ABT functionality for an additional two years following expiration of the existing
contract in June 2024.
During this two-year period, staff will continue to evaluate RTD’s fare collection systems for potential
enhancements and integrations in a holistic manner and to provide further alignment with RTD’s
Strategic Priorities. This will inform a competitive procurement for mobile ticketing and ABT software
and support, to be implemented at the conclusion of this recommended two-year contract extension.
The extension of this contract will include a 5% increase in the current monthly fixed payment, which
has remained flat for 2022 through 2024, of $150,000 to $157,500 in June 2024 and to $165,375 in
June 2025, in recognition of inflation as well as additional client support that will be provided.
Masabi has performed very well under the current contract by providing excellent customer service,
meeting contractual requirements for system availability and PCI compliance. In addition, Masabi has
been responsive and effective at implementing changes to account for the Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative, the New Year’s Eve Zero Fare offering, and the implementation of the Board-adopted 2024
fares and fare structure. Further, Masabi has assigned a dedicated Account Manager and Customer
Success Manager to RTD.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this two-year extension is a not-to-exceed amount of $3,874,500 in fixed costs
and an estimated $3,000,000 in card payment processing costs for a total not-to-exceed amount of
$6,874,500. The 2024 Budget approved by the Board in November 2023 includes funding for these
costs.

Budget Reporting Content Enhancements

April 16, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District conducts its business on a January through December fiscal year
basis. Staff prepares a single fiscal year budget each year. The budget for the forthcoming fiscal year
(i.e., the calendar year commencing January 1) is first presented for the Board’s consideration as a
Discussion Item during the Finance and Planning Committee, typically during the September or October
meeting cycle. Staff then posts the proposed budget by October 15 each year for public inspection and
comment, as required by state statute. After taking into consideration Board and stakeholder feedback
regarding the proposed budget and making modifications accordingly, staff subsequently presents the
final proposed budget as a Recommended Action for the Board’s consideration, first during the
November Finance and Planning Committee meeting and, if approved, during the regular November
Board meeting.
State statutes require RTD’s governing body to appropriate the fiscal year budget prior to January 1. If
the budget is not appropriated by the governing body by this deadline, the appropriation for the previous
fiscal year remains in effect for 90% of that fiscal year appropriated budget.
During the November 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff presented the 2024
Proposed Budget as a Recommended Action for Board appropriation for the 2024 fiscal year. At that
time, certain committee members expressed that the budget report and presentation materials should
contain additional budget detail information in future years.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Discussion Item is for staff to present proposed informational enhancements related
to the 2025 fiscal year budget, which will be presented to the Board for consideration in late Q3 and Q4
2024, and to solicit feedback.
Consideration of this Discussion Item is in alignment with the agency’s Strategic Priority of Financial
Success and the 2023-24 Strategic Initiative of Back to Basics.
