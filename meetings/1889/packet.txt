From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: March 4, 2014

Subject:

Budget Transfer for West Rail Line Track
Paving

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of the remaining funds from the Wadsworth
parking structure project to install track paving at three RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
BACKGROUND
RTD Light Rail Operations Division was notified by the train operators of pedestrians’ crossing over the
open ballast area to board trains at three stations. All of the light rail stations have an ADA approved
crossing; however, they are in a specified location and are not being used by the general public.
Additionally, representatives from Safety and Security noticed this action shortly after revenue services
started. As this poses a significant safety issue, we are proposing to fill the ballasted area between the
designated ADA crossings with concrete. This would create a solid, safe crossing structure for the
general public to use as needed and diminish the prospect of an individual tripping or falling in or near
the tracks.
The three specific stations are located at the Federal Center, Auraria West and the Sheridan Station.
DISCUSSION
Work will include the track paving at these three stations along with all required coordination with RTD
Light Rail personnel for site access. Work will be conducted during a scheduled Light Rail shut down or
with single tracking during off-peak areas so as not to inconvenience the traveling public and to provide
worker safety during the project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As part of the West Rail Line (WRL) transit corridor, located between the Auraria Campus in downtown
Denver and the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, RTD constructed two parking structures
at Wadsworth and Sheridan. Swinerton Builders was awarded a contract for both structures. The
portion of the overall WRL budget for the garages was $37.2M. The project was completed on schedule
and under budget. Funds from this underrun will be used to fund the track paving work. Funding for this
transfer is available in the 2014 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of
the remaining funds from the Wadsworth parking structure project to install track paving at three
RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to transfer the funds. Instead, leave the three West Corridor Light Rail Stations as they currently are
with the pedestrian’s crossing over the open ballast. This alternative is not recommended as it

Date:

February 25, 2014

Subject:

Property Acquisition for the North Metro
Rail Line Phase 2

F.

Clarke,Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 4, 2014

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail
Line Phase 2 from 72nd Avenue to 124th Avenue, Adams County, Colorado and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General
Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property
transactions.
BACKGROUND
Right of way necessary for the construction of the project must be acquired. Properties required for
Phase I (south of 72nd Avenue) were approved by the Board in September 2011 and May 2013. Property
needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process.
This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff recommends proceeding with the acquisition of all property identified,
subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or design/build activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail Line Phase 2 and authorizing staff to proceed with
all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or his
designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property transactions.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
NORTH METRO SEGMENT 1 COMMUTER RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Rail Line Phase II; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list
the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation
to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the
authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it
deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the
power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the North
Metro Rail Line Phase II, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a
significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit
from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that
there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in
furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are for the benefit of the public
health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Manager, as the Board’s
delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for the
acquisition of the property and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any property through good
faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power
of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property
owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of
owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties
as soon as permitted by law.
