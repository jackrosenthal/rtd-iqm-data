### B. CAC Update

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning at RTD noted that no Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) representative was present.  This was due to the change in scheduling as the FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting was originally scheduled for later in the evening.  The CAC update was done during the Planning & Development Committee meeting.

#### 1. Budget Transfer for West Rail Line Track Paving

It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of the remaining funds from the Wadsworth parking structure project to install track paving at three RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Committee Chair Lasater welcomed Henry Stopplecamp, Engineering Sr. Manager at RTD, to the Committee Meeting.  He introduced Mitch Kuharski, Construction Project Manager and John Ewy, Engineer for Drainage & General Civil Projects to the Directors.  Mr. Kuharski presented the pictures included in the agenda packet and noted that people were crossing through the tracks instead of using the pedestrian crossings.  The budget transfer, which requires Board approval, would provide a more suitable and safer surface for people to cross.  The approval of work falls under the General Manager’s authority.  He showed pictures of the Broadway station as an example of the final product.

Director Daly noted this project was a great idea, especially at the West Auraria station since it is a transfer point with high student traffic.

Committee Chair Lasater declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Property Acquisition for the North Metro Rail Line Phase 2

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail Line Phase 2 from 72nd  Avenue to 124th Avenue, Adams County, Colorado  and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property transactions.

Motion:              Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Mr. Stopplecamp welcomed Susan Altes, Real Property Manager, to the meeting.  She reminded the Directors of their approval for Phase 1, from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue, on September, 2011 and May, 2013.  She recommended proceeding with the acquisition of all property from 72nd to 124th, which is the end of the line under the negotiated contract.

Director Daly noted Ms. Altes presence at the Board and Committee meetings means the project is moving forward.

Committee Chair Lasater asked Ms. Altes for the number of properties to be acquired.   Ms. Altes answered 15 private properties and a few others that would involve an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Thornton.

Committee Chair Lasater declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. North Metro Update

Mr. Van Meter welcomed Ashland Vaughn, Engineering Project Manager for RTD, to the meeting.  Mr. Vaughn presented the North Metro Rail Line Update included in the March 4, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Daly mentioned that it would make sense for Denver Transit Partners (DTP) to operate the line and asked if the project would have to go to bid.  Mr. Vaughn answered that they are still looking into sole source justification and he would have an answer in a several weeks.

Director Bagley asked if there were any circumstances in the North Metro corridor project that have not been experienced previously.  Mr. Vaughn answered that there were no new circumstances expected and how the Eagle P3 project paved the way.

Director Sisk asked about the status of negotiations with one freight user that had freight rights on the North Metro line.  Mr. Vaughn answered that rail spur was included as part of the right of way that was approved and that the goal is to remove freight service from the corridor.

Director Folska asked about the total budget and contingency.  Mr. Terry Howerter answered from the audience that the budget was $650 million.  Mr. Vaughn said the contingency was 10%.

Committee Chair Lasater indicated that keeping freight traffic on the North Metro rail would result in additional costs factors, including bridging and wear and tear.  He would prefer if the process would come to an amicable requisition.

##### a. North Metro FMC 3-4-14 - accessible

### E. Other Matters

No other matters were presented.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lasater adjourned the meeting at 5:57 P.M. to the Planning & Development Committee.
