#### 1. 2016-021 : DUSPA Refinancing Proposal

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Motion:                 Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance & Administration, stated that RTD has been working with the City and County of Denver and the Denver Union Station Planning Authority (DUSPA) Board to find a way to refinance both of our current debt so we could repay the TIFFA and RIFF loan by lowering the debt and payments.  Collectively they have found a situation that will enable both RTD and the City and County of Denver to refinance and perform them separately and then come together and pay off loan; both entities will have significant savings.

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments, stated that DUSPA was established in 2008 to implement the construction improvements to Union Station.  In 2010, RTD entered into a funding agreement with DUSPA, that stated that RTD would pay DUSPA 12 Million Dollars per year for next 30 years that included an interest rate of 5.8%.  Brendon, talked how DUSPA was able to use that revenue stream along with other revenue streams to procure some loans from the U.S. Department of Transportation through RRIF and TIFIA loans. In 2016, Brad Langner from Piper Jaffray pitched the idea to refinancing DUSPA for interest savings. Fantastic idea on the surface – DUSPA put out an RFP for refinancing ideas, DUSPA received 7 responses that were reviewed by the board along with RTD and City and County staff. Brendon, remarked that the best joint proposal came from Piper Jaffray and BBVA Compass Bank.  The saving that will be incurred by this transaction is substantial; in the amount of approximately $87 Million dollars.  All RFP documentation is available in the Board Office.

Director Bagley stated it was to serve on the DUSPA board for the past 6 years.  He remarked that in reading all the proposals, Piper Jaffray and BBVA was the best proposal that was prepared.  He emphasized that this is a fantastic opportunity for RTD and stated that RTD can finally retire the RRIF and TIFIA loans through the federal government.  Lastly, he indicated that the City and County of Denver will save nearly double what RTD will be saving.

Director James said the DUSPA board was an excellent example of partners collaborating.  He thanked Brenden Morgan for his work with this transaction.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously

Discussion:                Heather Copp stated that at the time the Board approved the 2017 performance measures earlier in 2016, there were a couple of items that were still dependent on the 2017 budget including the commuter rail performance measures.

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager, Budget and Financial Analyst, stated that overall ridership increase will be 6.8% for 2017.  She also stated that fare revenue would be increased by 15.5% and the 2017 Operating Revenue will increase by 15.9%; both in agreement with the 2017 Budget.  She stated that the annual audits were changing from the number of audits to the percent completion of the annual audit plan as approved by the Board.  This goal is 100% of the plan for the year.  She also remarked that RTD will be adding a new goal commuter rail to reduce accidents by 1.5%, this goal is similar to the light rail goal which is less than or equal to 2. There is an addition to 3.1, a 90% on-time performance for the commuter rail which is similar to light rail.  She also stated that there will be an addition to 3.2; purposing 97% for service availability.

##### a. 2017 updated final performance measures

#### 5. Approval of Financial Advisor Selection

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) not to exceed $600,000 over a maximum of 5 years.

Motion:                Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Brenden Morgan stated that financial advisors are necessary to complete the issuance and refunding of bonds to help RTD capture the lowest cost of capital available on the market.  He explained that Investment banks are no longer allowed to discuss financing ideas with government entities unless they have retained a Financial Advisor; which will share innovated ideas and find ways to save money.  In October, RTD put out a RFP for Financial Advisors.  Three firms responded and they were reviewed by five RTD employees, and First Southwest Company’s proposal was deemed to be the best fit for RTD’s needs.  He stated that the contract will be for three years with two optional extensions for a total 600,000.  He noted that the contract was included in the 2017 adopted budget.

Director Sisk confirmed that First Southwest, as our financial advisor, will not participate on the other side of any financial transaction.

Brenden Morgan explained that if First Southwest is approved as RTD’s advisor, they will not be included in our underwriter pool.

#### 6. Naming Rights Implementation

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve transferring $144,000 from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Naming Rights Implementation Project for signage and the 2016 commission to WME/ IMG.

Motion:                Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Heather Copp stated that in 2015, it was decided that naming rights funds should be deposited in the Board Appropriated Reserve.  With this decision it was also known that there would be instances when funds may need to be drawn from the reserve to pay for on-going commissions and other contractual obligations.  She explained that funds are currently needed to pay a commission to WME/ING and there are some signage obligations that staff needs to fulfill in regards to the University of Colorado A Line naming rights contract.  She added that moving forward, commission fees will automatically be part of the budget

Director Hoy asked if all future funds collected for naming rights will be put into the Board Appropriated Reserve.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communication, said the Board approved depositing the money into the reserve; with the stipulation that funds for commissions and contractual obligations would be drawn from the reserve as needed.

Director Hoy asked why the University of Colorado A line signs just now being installed.

Scott Reed said that staff has been working with the University of Colorado’s (C.U.) Vice-President regarding proper branding to provide weather proof signage.

Director Hoy asked if C.U. is ok with the delay of their signs being installed.

Scott Reed assured Director Hoy that he has been in communication with C.U. and they are aware of the delays and they are on board with the instillation timeline.

Director Menten asked for more information about the conflict with the Arden Transit.

Scott Reed said Arden Transit has benches that are considered works of art and they cannot be altered in any way.  The reason that the conflict arose was because RTD wanted to modify the benches to suit our needs, which would have been in conflict with the overall design of the bench.

Director Menten requested additional documentation regarding the proposed project.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. August 2015 Board Approval of Sponsorship Naming Rights

#### 7. Audit Charter

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached Amended Audit Charter.

Motion:                Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop, Internal Audit Manager, stated that the previous Audit charter was approved in 2015.  Since then, IT Audit has been included in it’s scope of work and other minor things were added.

Director Hoy stated that throughout the document the term internal audit has been changed to RTD audit and asked for the reasoning behind that change.

Ann Marie stated that RTD Audit sounds more inclusive of the department as a whole.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. Audit Charter revised Dec16

#### 8. Annual Audit Plan 2017

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2017.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016 Board Meeting

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that the packet offers a summary of what the plan will entail.  It is the goal to accomplish 100% of the audits proposed in the plan.  She said that some of the follow up audits are incomplete as the audit department is limited on time; however, there are plans to conduct more follow up audits in 2017.  There are a handful of audits that will need to continue year after year such as FasTracks, Smart Card and Cyber Security.  She also stated that with so many audit hours dedicated, it can be hard to fulfill every request.  She remarked that if time becomes available in the future, then she will come to the board and prioritize the remaining requests.

Director Bagley asked how the audit plan is structured or prioritized within the plan.

Ann Marie responded that there is a heavy process in determining what is included in the annual plan.  She stated that there are over a dozen requested audits from last year that have rolled over to this year.

Director Bagley stated that there seems to be a lot of audit requests from board members, but the person requesting the audit is unknown.  He asked how the audit department prioritized the Board’s requests.

Ann Marie responded that she meets with each board member that is requesting an audit to vet through the process to determine if their request is even auditable. She explained that sometimes requests are actually part of another audit.  She added that the audit department has to determine realistic objectives to determine if a request is actually an audit and if the audit will have an impact on RTD’s policies and procedures.

Director Bagley asked General Manager Genova if he was familiar with the audits that are being requested by the Board and if he thinks they are appropriate.

General Manager Genova responded that he is aware and expressed that the audit department is looking specifically for audits that have the most value and substantial impacts to our agency.  He added that RTD wants to conduct audits that reduce our risk and build efficiencies.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. 2017 Audit Plan Proposed Final

#### 1. Quarterly Audit Update

Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop stated that she has prepared an update with three complete audits; two that are in draft stage and one that is circulating she added that audits will completed for 2016 as amended.

##### a. FAAC December 2016with attachments

#### 2. October 2016 Monthly Financial Statement

Doug MacLeod, Controller, indicated that there was an even number of green and red for the month of October.  He said Sales and Use taxes continue to be down and ridership maintains the same trends despite the new service lines.  He added that fare revenue is up, and we are $2.3 million ahead of budget.  He noted that while RTD is under budget by $2.2 million overall, staff has managed to keep our expenses low and we are on target for this year.

Director Bagley said the assumptions are looking better than they did three to four months ago.  He stated if we are getting internet taxes from Amazon, then the shortfall could be significantly less than what is projected here.

Chair Tobiassen said he was concerned with the passing of the new fare structure at the begging of the year, and asked if staff feels that our initial expectations will be met.

Heather Copp stated that staff did have to adjust the fare down, but the agency is doing better here at the end of the year.

Committee Chair Menten asked for details on the Amazon court ruling.

Doug MacLeod said a new law was established to encourage online retailers to collect taxes.  He stated that the US Supreme Court ruled that the law was just, but there is a state injunction in place that will need to be resolved first.

##### a. 103116 MFS

#### 3. SmartCard Project Update

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, stated that the disaster recovery testing is scheduled for this month.  Xerox is providing the mediation that we needed for testing.  She stated that staff is continuing to work with Safeway to schedule training, however, with the blackout that most stores have during the holiday season, this may not happen this month.  She informed the Board that staff is working on a schedule for site surveys at 58 stores which is required prior to installing the equipment.  She also gave an update on the reliability, maintainability and accuracy testing.  She indicated that testing was completed on the hardware and the system that drives the hardware.  She noted that there were several issues regarding mediation during this first phase, but Xerox is working to resolve those issues within the next following weeks.

Heather Copp stated that Xerox has 28 days to fix the hardware issue.  She also gave an update on Cyber Security and stated RTD should be receiving CPI Compliance Certification on December 23rd.  She noted that once we receive that certification it will state that Xerox has passed all of their CPI requirements and once we receive that document, staff will be able to test the web portal environment again.

Director Menten summarized Heather’s statement by saying that we have identified the problem and Xerox will have until December 23, 2016 to resolve, followed by a period of testing.

Chair Tobiassen stated that he found it troubling that the platform validators were having issues and asked why it is taking so long to be resolved.

Heather Copp responded that she is continually having parts replaced under the warranty.  She said that the notice to cure allowed staff to shed light on the validator issues and we will have to see how Xerox remediates those issues.

Director Francone stated that she is disappointed that we are not where we wanted to be at this point.  She asked what the consequences are for Xerox’s failure to comply.

Heather Copp said RTD could terminate the contract, however, that could set us back on our progress.  She noted that staff has been working with Legal on our rights in regards to the contract but it is a difficult process. She added that currently, RTD has 400,000 cards that exist in the Eco and College Pass program and if we terminate the contract, RTD does not have a method for those people to use our system.

General Manager Genova stated that if Xerox does not address these items, then they will continue to be in default.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the Finance department is working very closely with Legal to make sure that RTD is positioned well if there are further issues.  He noted that further discussions in relation to this contract should be discussed during an Executive Session.

Director Lasseter stated that big companies are sometimes lax on their product.  He encouraged the new board members to push hard to find more expedient and less expensive providers.

Director Solano asked if we are communicating through legal briefs with Xerox.

Rolf Asphaug responded that RTD submitted a written Notice to Cure.  He stated that any follow up since then has been in accordance with the notice to cure procedures.

#### 4. Third Quarter 2016 Performance Report

Janette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, shared the year to date indicators through September 30, 2016.  She noted that the Board Report is self-explanatory and indicated that the third quarter is stable, similar to the second quarter.  She added that customer complaints are about the same and we are seeing ridership improving and fare revenue is above goal

##### a. 2016 performance measures-third quarter

### D. Other Matters

Committee Chair Menten indicated that while RTD has some savings, the agency still has some substantial upcoming capital projects that will need to be covered.

### F. Adjourn
