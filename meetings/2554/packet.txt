Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain
outstanding obligations; providing for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and
approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
The Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) was established in 2008 to implement and
direct construction and improvements for the Denver Union Station Project. DUSPA is governed by a
Board of Directors comprised of appointed members from the Regional Transportation District, the
City of Denver, DRCOG, and CDOT.
In 2010, RTD entered a funding agreement with DUSPA as part of the plan of finance related to the
design, construction and renovation of the Denver Union Station project area. The funding
agreement was in the form of a bond payment from RTD to DUSPA in the amount of approximately
$12 million per year at an interest rate of 5.85% (RTD/DUSPA Bond). As a result, DUSPA was able
to use the RTD revenue along with other available revenue sources to obtain a Railroad Rehabilitation
& Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan and Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA) loan from the US Department of Transportation.
In October 2016, the DUSPA Board issued a Request for Proposals for refinancing the outstanding
DUSPA loans. DUSPA received seven responses which were reviewed by the DUSPA Board, its
financial advisor, PFM and staff from RTD and the City and County of Denver. The best proposal
was deemed to have come from a collaboration between Piper Jaffray and BBVA Compass Bank.
The proposal offers financial benefit to RTD, the City and County of Denver as well as DUSPA.
This action item discusses the refinancing of the RTD/DUSPA bond to achieve a reduction in interest
payments for RTD.
DISSCUSSION:
With the current low interest rate environment the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is
available in relation to the RTD/DUSPA bond. RTD has the opportunity to refinance the 2010
RTD/DUSPA bond with RTD FasTracks bonds and realize a substantial savings in interest payments.

1.B.1

The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to
changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The potential savings from
a refunding of the RTD/DUSPA Bond exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and prepared documentation to be in a position
to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
Due to the unique nature of the RTD/DUSPA Bond and the fact that there are multiple stakeholders
including DUSPA and the City and County of Denver, the exact timing of this transaction will be
dependent on the ability of all involved parties to coordinate a simultaneous closing, as required by
the RRIF and TIFIA loans. It is expected that this will be achievable during the first half of 2017.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Piper Jaffray, Stifel Nicholaus, Harvestons Securities and DA Davidson.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing for other
matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the
Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing
for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject:

Refunding 2007A FT Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 8, 2016

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain
outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds and the security
therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
In 2007, RTD issued its Series 2007A FasTracks bonds to refinance a portion of the Series 2006A
FasTracks bonds. The original proceeds from this financing were used to partially fund construction
of various FasTracks projects including, US36, West Line and EAGLE.
This action item discusses the refinancing of a portion of the currently outstanding Series 2007A
FasTracks bonds to achieve a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $363.725 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the
“2007 Bonds”) in 2007 for the purpose of refinancing a portion of the Series 2006A FasTracks
bonds for interest savings. In 2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725
million of the $600 million 2006A Bonds to capture $11.373 million in present value savings
(3.122% of principal of refunded bonds).
With the current low interest rate environment and the approaching November 1, 2017 call date on
the series 2007A bonds, the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is available. RTD has the
opportunity to advance refund a portion of the outstanding 2007A Bonds to realize, subject to
market movement, a savings of approximately $5.8 million (4.2% of principal of refunded bonds) on
a tax-exempt basis. The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some
flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The
2007A Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding
bonds and optional redemption date of the 2007 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time

Packet Pg. 19

1.B.2

proceeds of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2007 Bonds. Despite the
cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2007
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the
opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, US Bancorp, Loop Capital, Harvestons Securities and George K Baum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for
other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for
other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. This is
not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather

Date:

December 7, 2016

Subject:

Refunding 2002A COP

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery
by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the refinancing
of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
BACKGROUND:
In 2002, RTD issued its Series 2002A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 34 new Siemens
light rail vehicles and partially fund the Elati light rail maintenance facility. The amount financed in
2002 was $132,000,000. The COPs are callable at par on November 1, 2017 and final payment is
scheduled to occur in 2022.
The remaining outstanding balance of the COPs is currently $71,400,000 and the interest rate being
paid ranges from 4.5%-5.0%.
The approaching call date and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the 2002A COPs to realize a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD has the potential to advance-refund a portion of the remaining outstanding Series 2002A COPs
to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $4.86 million (6.81% of principal
of refunded COPs). RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of 3% savings which
allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the new
interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to
the interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the
new financing and the November 1, 2017 call date of the 2002A COPs (negative arbitrage). Absent
a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction
in time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2002A COPs.
Despite the cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the
2002A COPs exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has
assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of
the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.

Packet Pg. 36

1.B.3

RTD typically uses COPs to finance vehicles when the budget cannot accommodate the use of cash
to acquire the necessary vehicles, as was the case in 2002. In this case, staff received an attractive
proposal from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the use of lease financing to refinance the Series
2002A Certificates of Participation. As a response to this proposal, staff solicited similar proposals
from the banks in RTD’s underwriter pool. Five responses were received and reviewed by staff and
RTD’s financial advisor. It was determined that the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal offered the
most value to RTD.
Benefits of the JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal include interest rates competitive with a
refinancing of the 2002A COPs with new COPs, a call option for RTD after just 12 months and the
ability to avoid the cost of obtaining credit ratings.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Series 2002A
COPs through an annually appropriated capital lease through JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.
Drafts of documents including the Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, Purchase and
Assignment Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The lender in this transaction will be
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney and miscellaneous costs. The final
payment year of the new financing will not exceed the final payment year of the existing Series
2002A COPs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016 authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project. This
is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

1.B.3.a

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease or the Assignment Agreement shall be construed as creating or constituting a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement
against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year. The District
shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the Assignment Agreement except
in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain other
payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with
the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the Assignment Agreement shall constitute a
mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then

multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional
or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect
District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the

Assignment Agreement shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments
beyond those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.

Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2016A Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2016A Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2016A Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2016A Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to 2002A Trustee. In the event that
the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding
Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the
Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of
the District its option to purchase all of the 2002A Leased Property in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the 2002A Master Lease and to redeem all of the 2002A Certificates (the
“Refunded Certificates”), on December 1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to the principal
amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date or maturity date, without
premium, or as otherwise set forth in the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project. Upon
the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby
irrevocably instructs the 2002A Trustee to give notice of refunding and defeasance to the Owners
of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the 2002A
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement.

Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of any amounts due under the Lease or the Assignment Agreement. Such recourse shall
not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or otherwise,
whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or otherwise.
By the acceptance of the Assignment Agreement and as a part of the consideration of its sale or
purchase, any person purchasing or selling the Assignment Agreement specifically waives any
such recourse.

Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as

provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2016A Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2016A Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

December 7, 2016

Subject:

Update to the 2017 Quarterly Performance
Report

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt updated 2017 Quarterly Performance Measures to include measures for ridership,
fare revenue, total operating revenue, and commuter rail.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
The year-to-date performance measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it
provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives. In 2017, 41 performance measures will be tracked for the GM.
When the 2017 performance measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016, it was stated
the following measures would be established by the financial plans inherent in the 2017 Adopted
Budget. These measures are as follows:
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
It is recommended that the overall ridership increase for 2017 be established at 6.8%. This
assumes all ridership growth will come from FasTracks as the Base System ridership estimate for
2017 is flat over 2016. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.5%. This is the
percentage increase in total fare revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the 2016 projection.
The increase is driven by increased ridership in FasTracks as Base System ridership and fare
revenue are kept flat in 2017. This is an annual measure.
It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.9%.
This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the
2016 projection, which takes into account minor items of operating revenue such as advertising,
joint venture, parking, and other miscellaneous revenue. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.4 – Monitor Selected Internal Functions for Efficiency
The goal for annual audits is changed for 2017 from the number of audits to the percentage
completion of the Annual Audit Plan per Board approval on 11/29/16. The goal for percentage
completion is 100%.
Commuter Rail
It was noted when the 2017 Performance Measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016 that
a performance protocol was being developed for commuter rail linked to the concessionaire
agreement with DTP and that measures to be tracked in 2017 would be brought to the Board at a
later date for review. The following measurement criteria have been developed:

Packet Pg. 47

1.B.4

Goal 1.5 – Reduce the Number of Commuter Rail Accidents
It is recommended that a new goal be added to measure the number of reportable preventable
commuter rail accidents per 100,000 train miles. The measure is the same as for light rail in
preceding Goal 1.4.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On Time Performance
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 90.0% which is the same as light rail
on-time service. The on-time definition for commuter rail is departure from a location no more
than 0 minutes early or 5 minutes after the scheduled departure time.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain System-Wide Service Availability
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 97.0% which is lower than light rail
service available because of additional FRA requirements that must be followed to bring commuter rail
cars into service. The measure is calculated as actual car miles operated divided by total scheduled
car miles.

Subject:

Approval of Financial Advisor Selection

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to First
Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as
defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) not to exceed $600,000 over a maximum of 5
years.
BACKGROUND:
Financial advisor services are necessary to complete the issuance and refinancing of bonds and
certificates of participation. Their services help RTD achieve the lowest cost of capital available in
the market by providing guidance on appropriate pricing of bonds and certificates of participation and
assisting in the management of credit rating agency relations. Additionally, investment banks are no
longer allowed to discuss financing or refinancing ideas with local governments unless the local
government has retained a Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission.
DISSCUSSION:
In October 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for financial advisory services. Proposals
were received from three firms and the proposals were reviewed by a review committee of 5 RTD
employees. The three firms that responded to RTD’s RFP included First Southwest, PFM and George
K. Baum.
Proposals were reviewed by the review committee and judged based on a best value to RTD basis.
It was determined that the First Southwest proposal offered the most value to RTD.
Benefits of the First Southwest proposal include an in depth understanding the existing RTD capital
structure, existing RTD debt and other financial obligations, constraints and priorities of RTD. The
Fees of all three proposals were judged to be competitive with each other.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act
as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to
RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the contract will be paid for with local funds. The contract will be for three
years with two optional one-year extensions. The cost of the contract for a full five years would be

Packet Pg. 59

1.B.5

$600,000 ($120,000 per year). The funding for the contract was included in the 2017 adopted
budget, SBP and APE.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to
First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal
Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD.
This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and
Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD. This is not the
recommended action as it would not allow RTD to continue to manage it take advantage of
the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Naming Rights Implementation

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve transferring $144,000 from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Naming Rights
Implementation Project for signage and the 2016 commission to WME/ IMG.
BACKGROUND
On August 18, 2015, see attached, the Board of Director’s approved the sponsorship naming right
agreement with the University of Colorado for the sponsorship naming rights on the A line and an
exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer for a five-year period with a mutually agreed upon right
to extend this agreement for an additional five years.
Over the initial five-year period, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.
It was
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Appropriated Reserve. In the
first year of the agreement, a portion of the funds would be utilized for the implementation and
activation of the naming rights partner benefits including signage and updating of collateral materials. In
addition, the agent WME/IMG is entitled per contract to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenues.
DISCUSSION
The request will fund signs and the 2016 WME/ IMG commission. Attached as an addendum to this
report is the engineering diagram for the proposed signs. This design has been arrived at following
discussions with project engineers and facilities management staff about other options such as: signs on
railing, signs on windscreens and/or banners on light poles at each station platform; all of which resulted
in uncovering the fact that these other options did not meet engineering specifications for max wind
load [creating safety concerns] and being in conflict with RTD’s Art in Transit program.
These standalone signs are intended to be placed near the leading end of the platform in the direction of
travel. [e.g. western end of the west bound side and eastern end of the eastbound side]. There are to be
(2) signs per station [one per platform]. Content for these signs will be created by Univ. of Colorado.
RTD is responsible for the initial installation and maintenance. CU will responsible for subsequent
content changes; up to 4 changes per year per the rights and benefits associated with the naming rights
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact as those funds were placed in the Board Appropriated Fund to pay for
implementation and activation of the naming right partner benefits including signage and updating of
collateral materials. The agent WME/IMG is entitled to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenue.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the staff’s recommendation and complete the installation of signage and pay the annual
commission.

Packet Pg. 61

1.B.6

2. Do not accept the staff’s recommendation. If we don’t complete our requirements under
the contract it will jeopardize the ability to receive the remaining funds estimated at
approximately $4.5 million.

with the Board, authorizes access to records, personnel and physical properties relevant to performance
of engagements and defines the scope of audit activities. Final approval of the Audit Charter resides
with the Board.
DISCUSSION
The Audit function is engaged in Internal Audits and IT Audits, using either one of the function names
excludes the other so Audit will henceforth be referred to as RTD Audit, to be all inclusive.
The Scope of work has been expanded to include IT Audits and Investigations both of which Audit has
engaged in, but were not included in the previous Audit Charter.
The Independence and Accountability changes include adding the governing body for IT Auditing Information Systems Audit and Control Association, ISACA and eliminating the administrative reporting
requirement in line with the change of reporting responsibility to the General Manager and CEO, effective
January 2017.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached amended Audit Charter.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the amended Audit Charter. This action
is not recommended. RTD Audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity
designed to add value and improve RTD's operations. The Audit Charter provides the foundation
upon which the Audit Activity is based; without which Audit could be deprived of independence
and objectivity.

Annual Audit Plan 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2017.
BACKGROUND
The Annual Audit Plan has historically been approved by the General Manager and CEO and the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The Annual Audit Plan for 2017 includes several IT Audits and Internal Audits. The plan also includes
Follow-up Audits and a section containing Audit Requests that have not been prioritized for 2017.
The Annual Audit Plan is based on estimates of the time to complete the audits. As in past years it
utilizes every available business day. If time becomes available during the year Audit will refer to the
Board for approval of audits to be included as replacements.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Annual Audit Plan as presented. This is the recommended action. This will allow
Audit to complete the audit process in a timely manner.
2. Do not approve the Annual Audit Plan. This is not recommended. This Audit Plan was developed
after carefully selecting audits according to their potential to improve RTD’s policies and
procedures and contribute to the Goals and Objectives of the District. Delaying approval could
limit the days available for auditing and thereby reduce overall audit presence in the District.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT
AUDIT REPORT # 16-03-02

The Communications Department is comprised of the three following Divisions as
described in RTD documents:
 Marketing - develops, designs, and implements proactive marketing, digital
communications and special event strategies for internal and external audiences that
create and enhance widespread positive awareness of RTD and its image; and
educates, informs, and promotes the use of RTD products, services, and programs.


Public Information/Public Relations (PI/PR) - communicates the progress and benefits
of the multi-billion dollar FasTracks transit expansion program. Also keeps RTD’s
internal and external audiences informed and engaged about the agency’s services,
programs and projects.



Customer Care - fosters public trust by providing comprehensive and accurate
information, while enhancing and developing innovative platforms for customer
engagement.

As a result of the significant expansion of rail lines over the past several years, additional
‘temporary’ staff have been utilized in various RTD Divisions, including Marketing and
also Public Relations/Public Information (PR/PI). Such employees are either contracted
through an approved Staffing Agency, or may be hired directly into RTD as Project
Employees, with an agreed upon end date for their service.
RTD has a written manual which provides guidance for the acquisition, use, and
management review of P-Cards within the organization. P-Cards are intended to be a
more efficient and cost effective way to buy and pay for lower value company purchases.
Administration of P-Cards is through Citibank, with an agreement that is overseen by the
RTD Procurement Division.
Every employee with a P-Card, and their
reviewing/approving manager, are required to comply with the internal policies and
procedures which govern the use of these cards.
SCOPE
This audit concentrated on the use of P-Cards in Customer Care and PI/PR. Internal
Audit also reviewed staffing in the Marketing and PI/PR Divisions.
OBJECTIVES
PCards:
 Determine adherence to Purchasing Card policies and procedures.

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing identified routine PCard purchases of one division’s coffee and
break room supplies; and monthly employee birthday cakes, which have now been
discontinued.
Senior Management will continue to monitor staffing needs of the Communications
Department as construction of new rail lines are finished and become operational.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
PURCHASING CARDS – MARKETING DEPT.
AUDIT REPORT # 16-08-11

Purchasing Cards (PCards) are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and costeffective way to buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of
Colorado Master Contract for Credit Card Services that operates through Citibank. At the
current time, there are four Citibank ‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to RTD Marketing
employees. Approval limits for individual transactions are limited to $3,000 with monthly
card limits maintained between $20,000 and $30,000 for Marketing employees.
During our eight-month test period these four PCard holders spent a combined average
of just under $37,800 per month. The current PCard contract includes a periodic rebate
to RTD equal to 1.7% of purchases.
AUDIT SCOPE
We selected individual Marketing employee PCard statements from November 2015
through June 2016 for review of supporting documentation and compliance with RTD
policies and procedures including:




The procurement of appropriate goods and services for RTD business purposes are
within the employee’s assigned credit limits.
The monthly supervisory review and approval process was adequate and timely.
Individual transactions were not ‘split’ into two charges in order to qualify within the
employee’s credit limits.
CONCLUSION

Internal Audit’s testing indicated that most Marketing PCard transactions were properly
handled. However, we identified one situation of a perceived ‘split transaction’ and several
examples of food or drink purchases for meetings that were not supported with a
documented business purpose and a list of attendees.
Audit has recommended that a consistent approach be developed to attach appropriate
supporting documents for Business Meeting costs charged to PCards.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE REVIEW
2016 INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 16-01-11

RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses, and train
platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Affiliated Computer Services, a firm purchased by Xerox
with previous expertise in developing such systems, has been working with RTD since 2011 to
implement all aspects of this project. The RTD Board approved the most recent contract increase
with Xerox Transport Solutions in 2016, which raised the estimated external project cost to $20.5
million.
Since 2013, efforts have concentrated on developing a system that will allow passengers to
purchase credit as ‘stored value’ on their MyRide card, which will then be reduced when the card
holder ‘taps on’ to ride an RTD Bus or Rail vehicle. Security Officers will be utilized to periodically
test Rail riders’ cards to verify that they have ‘tapped on’ and have not exceeded their ‘paid-for’
trip length. Stored Value capability was initially planned for mid-2014, and was tested with a Public
Pilot during 2016. However, a concern regarding the security of customers’ credit card data when
reloading their MyRide cards via the Internet has been raised by RTD and a ‘Right to Cure’ notice
has been issued to Xerox. As a result, a firm date for system roll-out does not currently exist.
AUDIT SCOPE

Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle approach, our participation since project startup has continued to include a review of the development procedures being used to build
a system that will satisfy the needs of the District. Internal Audit has also monitored
activities to ensure new capabilities are adequately tested in advance of moving into a
live, full production environment.
CONCLUSION
During 2016, the RTD Project Team continued to work with Xerox in an effort to develop the
electronic fare media system that was originally anticipated. However, as noted above, problems
and setbacks have been experienced and the goal to ‘go live’ with Stored Value capability has
now been indefinitely postponed.
The original hardware used by Security Officers to test Rail patrons’ MyRide cards and ensure
accurate recording of their trip, required replacement during 2016 and new equipment is now in
use. However, LRT passengers who use an ECO or College Pass and who are identified as not
having ‘tapped on’ are not subject to any fines or ‘loss of use’ penalties at this time. In addition,
other issues including Platform Validator screens ‘going black’, creation of acceptable Fraud
Reports, testing of the designed Disaster Recovery Plan, and utilizing retail locations to sell stored
value for customer cards continue to be pursued.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit followup as Internal Audit continues to be involved with the Project Team.

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2016
Information

The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and NeighborhoodPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
November, 2016, 1.45M taps were recorded.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of approximately December 1, 2016, a total of 1,920 cards
were issued of which 1,520 (79%) were full fare and 400 (21%) were discount cards. The average
initial stored value loading is $41.20 with a total value loaded including reloads of $316,800. There
have been 115,000 boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $253,900. Of these
boardings; 70% were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations were completed for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as
buses are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and B line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R line to
Aurora. All 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2016. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 37 performance
measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 33 in the third quarter. The following is a discussion of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for Local on-time service and Regional on-time
service in Q3.
In Local on-time service, overall performance was slightly weaker from Q2. First TransitLongmont was the only carrier that exceeded goal while the remaining carriers did not meet goal.
Regional on-time performance did not meet goal but was stable compared to Q2. Staff will
continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the resources
needed to improve, such as service changes and operator training.
Light Rail performance exceeded goal for both on-time service and service availability.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
Staffing challenges continued to cause fluctuations in on-time performance in Q3.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
The ridership goal is established with the 2016 Amended Budget. Although the goal was not met
in Q3 on a year-to-date basis, this measure is more properly assessed annually. We will monitor
and look forward to more data post-FasTracks roll-out in 2016.

Please see the footnotes to the report for exceptions within overall performance measures 1.1 and
4.2.

three carriers had a high number of complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late, discourtesy,
passed up passengers at stop). We also noted a decrease in ridership for all carriers (including RTD) compared to
each quarter in 2015. Transdev especially showed a large increase in “no show” complaints, most likely due to the
number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to lack of operator availability.
