Director Hoy asked Roger Sherman to make sure the calendars are submitted to the Board office to keep the Board members informed.

#### 1. Contract Award to HNTB Corporation for Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091.  It is further recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract, staff time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS.  These funds will be replenished in the 2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.

Bill Van Meter and Chris Quinn, project manager of the study, stated that RTD issued a RFP in December 2012 for a consultant to conduct the study, which will evaluate the overall mobility options in the Northwest area.  The evaluation committee includes RTD staff and CDOT representatives.  The study will determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and determine what remaining BRT elements are needed; evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line in segments; evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont; and conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 downtown Express lanes.  The final product will prioritize a list of improvements for the Northwest area.  For each item the consultant will develop base year capital and operations and maintenance (O&M) cost estimates and conduct fatal flaw analyses of technical financial and environmental issues related to the improvement.

HNTB has committed to achieve the 22 DBE goal; they already have 19 DBEs in their staff.  They conduct their own outreach.

Motion:              Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Solano asked if there is representation from the North area in the committee.  Chris Quinn stated they had representation from the different cities in that area.  Director Solano also asked what the feedback from Thornton and Adams County was.  Chris Quinn stated that they provided their feedback directly to the committee.

Chair Anderson commented that she has worked with HNTB and finds them a very professional organization.  She supports this selection.

Director Bagley stated that this is a very critical study in the North metro area.  He asked what staff members will be monitoring the process and if there is opportunity for other members of the Board to be involved.  He also asked if significant activities will be brought to the Board since there needs to be more oversight.  Bill Van Meter stated that the staff includes Chris Quinn, Nadine Lee, Rick Clarke and himself as well as Pauletta Tonilas from the PI team.  They are putting together both technical advisory and policy advisory committees which will have active stakeholders and public representation.  They intend to brief the Board on an as needed basis to keep them informed.  They expect the Directors from the area will be very engaged in the study.  Director Bagley asked how the Board members are going to be involved.  Bill Van Meter explained that those details will be set as they move forward with the discussion with HNTB.  General Manager Phil Washington stated that he will also be directly involved and will provide oversight of the whole process.  They will bring major decisions to the Board and welcome Directors’ input all along the way.  The makeup of the technical and policy committee was agreed upon by the stakeholders, but that does not preclude the Board from providing input.

Director Bagley stated that when staff brings the issue back, the Board would like to know who the individuals in those committees are.

Director Lubow advised that she will be very involved as one of the RTD directors from that area and would like to sit on the different committees.

Director Hoy asked General Manager Washington to bring a report of their quarterly outreach meeting for each of the areas they visit.

Director Solano also asked to be part of the committees as the input from the North area seems to be lacking.

Director Sisk also looks forward to participating in any way he can.  He thinks all members should be involved to ensure this is a successful study.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked that they have somebody in the committee that is transit dependent, because they provide a different perspective.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED to the Recommended Action.

#### 2. Aconex Contract Extension

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option years on the contract with Aconex, in the total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management Software as a Service, extending the end date of the contract to April 2017.  Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget, and future year funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Lisa Dorrance, project manager for Aconex  stated that Aconex contract was approved by the Board in April 2010 to provide an online construction and document management system for the FasTracks Program.  Since the original implementation in 2010, RTD has used the system in 20 projects for FasTracks and Capital Programs.  They have over 3600 users in different projects and about 1.9 million documents and 1.7 have been generated from outside entities.  Stakeholders have really embraced the system.  The original contract was for three years with four one year options.  The cost of exercising all four option years at once would be $480,000 ($120,000 per year) saving RTD $120,000 since exercising each individual options would cost $600,000.  The funding for this contract is included in the 2013 adopted budget.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED to the Recommended Action.

#### 3. Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:

- Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;

- Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);

- Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;

- Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter and John Shonsey stated that in December 2012 the Board approved the first eight opportunities identified as part of the RAM.  On January 22, 2013, staff presented three additional items for the Board’s information.  These include: 1) refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR; 2) Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR and 3) issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment.  All these actions will have to be presented separately to the Board.

Staff has assigned a risk level of “low” to these additional RAM items because they allow RTD to take advantage of historically low interest rates to build more of the FasTracks program.  It will also have a positive financial impact to the FasTracks capital program by refinancing existing debt issues.

Director Hoy thanked the staff and management for their forward thought and working all the angles of the commitment to get things done and run the agency efficiently.

Director Deadwyler asked if with the refinancing we are adding additional years or money.  Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that they are not extending the repayment period or adding additional money to the bond issues, the lower interest rate will reduce the payments over time.  Director Deadwyler asked which Bonds.  Terry explained that these will be the two sales tax bond issues that will be brought next Tuesday night.  Cop issue would be the third document that would probably be presented in March.

Director Lasater thanked the staff for helping him understand the cost per mile from DUS to 72nd and found that it is the 3rd lowest.  The highest is double the average which is $52.1.  This is a complex area, but not as expensive as he had thought.  The most expensive is the Southeast corridor extension.  He thinks this is a great timing to move on this and get entire corridor done.  General Manager Phil Washington clarified that two weeks ago he was referring that this portion is the most expensive of this same line, not that the line was the most expensive.

Director Bagley asked for clarification on the number of votes needed to pass the items in the agenda.  Marla Lien explained that at the Board meeting they need 10 votes for issues that authorize the General Manager to initiate procurement for construction.  For the debt issues would only need 8.  In the committee meetings they need a majority of votes.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED to the Unanimous Consent Agenda

#### 1. Central Rail Extension Update

John Shonsey, Chief Engineering for RTD and Andy Mutz, project manager stated that this is a FasTracks project that adds 0.8 miles of rail from 30th & Downing to 38th & Blake.  It adds two stations and connects downtown light rail loop to the East Rail Line.  It is a single light rail vehicle and is part of the Environmental Evaluation (EE) adopted by the Board in 2010.

The challenges faced by the project include signal timing changes in downtown loop.  The trains cannot operate per EE and as planned in downtown loop due to the signal timing changes.

Andy Mutz stated that the staff conducted some brief studies in 2012.  They talked to the community as to what they would like to see.  The feedback is that they want to see the street car facility for streetcar maintenance.  The business Community believes streetcar will stimulate economic development on Welton Street; it will connect Welton Street with double track streetcar.  The study’s scope included hiring a consultant for additional study.  For this they have found $500,000 from $305 million savings from Eagle.  The study would focus on resolving the operation plan issue; study 2-3 alternative alignments into downtown and begin concept analysis in ridership, operations and capital costs.  It will also look at outreach and coordination with CCD and local stakeholders and public on preferred alignment.  Study will also include recommendations on presentation to RTD Senior Leadership Team and RTD Board and public presentation upon approval and develop next steps for implementation including funding.

Director Folska asked if they had had an opportunity to see what they are doing at Colfax and if they have consider that people with disabilities have issues getting on and off the streetcars.  She also asked what will happen to the existing tracks.  Staff stated that they are coordinating with the City of Denver on their study of Colfax, but that study is not only looking at streetcars.  They will be looking at the technology to use to address the issues of the people with disability.  They are not proposing to take out the existing track at this point.  The RTD portion of this remains the same as far as capital.  Getting into seeing whose paying for changes is not something that will be covered by this study.

#### 2. FasTracks PI Update

Scott Reed, assistant general manager for communications and Pauletta Tonilas provided an overview of the FasTracks Public Information Division which is a combination of RTD staff and Virtegic Group public information consultant working as an extension of RTD staff; they operate in a seamless mode while having different levels of expertise.  They work out of the FasTracks’ office.  The PI Division is part of the RTD Communications Department.

They also provided contact information for the different members of the team.

Functional areas of the PI Program include: media relations, public involvement, public outreach, crisis communications, government and internal relations.

This team manages internal and external communications, outreach and media relations for FasTracks program and its projects; provides strategic communications and outreach advice to Senior Leadership Team and FasTracks Senior Management Team; provides PI liaisons for each FasTracks project; develops strategies to address and resolve program and project-related issues; develops collateral and other informational materials; ensures consistency in use of brand/identity and ensures consistent messaging – “One Voice” approach.

Pauletta also provided the highlights for 2012 which included activities in public involvement, government relations, internal and media relations.  They also managed the speakers’ bureau for FasTracks.  The FasTracks impacts/community touches for 2012 included 46.7 million potential audience impression, 3.96 million impressions from “Railvolutionary” outdoor ads among others.  The FasTracks Strategic PI Plan and Approach was also included in the Board packet and is based on the feedback the Board provided in 2012, focusing on promoting progress, being proactive, building trust, developing of relationships and focus in a regional cooperation.

The support they provide to the Board includes an annual key messages manual that they provide to each member.  They also provide fact-sheets and informational materials and outreach activities with/for the Board members.

For 2013 they will continue to provide quarterly FasTracks progress Fact sheets.  I-225 groundbreaking is scheduled for March 1. They are waiting direction from Board Chair on the Board/Staff Communications Charrettes.  The West Rail line will open on April 26.  They will hold the Board communications training in spring. Public opinion survey will be held in May/June and telephone town halls in the fall of 2013.

They presented a video on FasTracks Inside Look.

Scott Reed also pointed out that looking at the amount of projects they are responsible for, they have the single largest program and they do a large amount of work and sometimes it is not really visible because they are dealing with other entities; however the overall impact of the team is great.

Director Folska thanked them for the presentation and asked how much does a town hall meeting cost. Pauletta Tonilas responded that based on the town halls from last year each call is 8 cents per call and with 45,000 that actually participates the cost is 82 cents.  Director Folska asked how each town hall is evaluated.  Pauletta stated that the real value is when people call in to ask questions to the Board members or people calling back in response to voice mail left.  They want to make sure this is a two way communication.  Director Folska stated that most of the communications seems to be one way and asked what they are doing to engage the citizens more.  Pauletta stated that they have changed some things in the program to do more in the community.  Sherman will be a community strategic advisor, focusing on the charrettes and identifying tools to outreach and engage people with social media.

Director Tobiassen thanked the team for the great work.  He particularly wanted to mention Tina Jaquez as he has worked with her in several activities.  He also acknowledged Kevin Flynn for his work in Facebook.  He commented on the Fly Over Video and people always appreciate the content and grasp their attention.  At some point he would like to know how they measure their impact through the social media.  Pauletta Tonilas stated that Kevin has been tracking Facebook and other entities are sharing RTDs posts in their websites.

Director Solano asked if they have a line for the impaired at the telephone town hall. Pauletta Tonilas stated that they do have a line for the impaired at the phone town halls.  Scott Reed also stated that at the actual town hall if they receive a request they will make sure to have sign language available.  For different meetings they try to focus on the areas where they are going to host the meeting.

Director Daly stated that he is very excited about the opening of the West Corridor.  Pauletta Tonilas stated that the reception is going at be at the end of the line at Jefferson County Government.  The events on the 26th will be very similar to what has been done for other line openings.  They’ll have the VIP train; there will be station parties sponsored by the individual municipalities.  They will have free rides on the West Line on Friday.  On Saturday the entire system will be free and on Sunday they will start the regular service.  Director Daly asked about the parking station.   Scott Reed stated that those are part of the West corridor.  They will have a special ride for the Board.

Director Lubow thanked them for their presentation and suggested that for 2013 based on what is happening on the North, she would like to see a real push letting the citizens in the North area know what is happening.

Director Walker asked how well attended have the media groups been.  Scott Reed stated that they have been very well attended and received great feedback as how they like to get information from RTD and what they think is important about FasTracks for their readers/listeners.  Scott also stated that at the last meeting they had all the TV stations’ traffic reporters who are very interested on how FasTracks is moving.  It was a very good opportunity to give them information and getting feedback from them.  Director Walker asked if that provides an opportunity for us to use their coverage.  Scott stated that it does not.  Director Walker stated that he does not mind when the reports don’t look so good, because it means they are working hard.

Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked the team; she thinks we have the best PI in the country.  She acknowledged Brenda Tierney for her amazing work because she has provided excellent support for that area in presentations for the community.  Director Rivera-Malpiede also stated that she will be working with different Council members on the Sheridan Station.  They have a resident that is over 90 years and is very excited to be part of the process.  She also acknowledged Daria Serna, Sherman Hamilton and other team members.

Director Solano stated that the Hispanic community is large and wants to know how they will reach out to them.  Pauletta Tonilas stated that it is part of the focus outreach efforts and have done some Spanish translations of their presentations and expect to continue more of that. They have several groups they work with.

Director Hoy thanked them for the video presentation.

Chair Anderson also thanked them for the amazing work.  Pauletta Tonilas recognized Michele Brier for her leadership and stated that the video will be sent to key stakeholders, YouTube and local channels.  She also mentioned that the Colorado Greater Metro Communication Consortium chose to do their next regional video on FasTracks.  It will be a 30 minute program combined with panel discussions and will air starting this Thursday at 8:00 p.m. and will play every Thursday for the next month.

Director Folska thanked them for the video.  She would like to see the community members talking about what FasTracks means for them.  Pauletta stated that in the past they have used community members for the videos, but they wanted to do something different this time.
