BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report
to Governance

July 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to accept into the records the Regional Transportation District’s Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report, which includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2023.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager, Accounting
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The audit firm Plante Moran, PLLC performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required by
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2023 and 2022 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this Recommended Action.

June 17, 2024
Chair Davidson, Board Members and RTD service area residents,
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning RTD’s finances. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations,
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both
to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable
information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The cost
of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal
controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial
statements will be free from material misstatement. As the General Manager and CEO, I assert
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all
material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of this report in the Financial Section.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only
on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and
legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s
separately issued Single Audit Report.

GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in
conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
RTD provides public transportation services to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver metropolitan region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the
best method to ensure the continuation of this vital service. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of
Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.1 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that is elected directly by a constituency
to serve four-year staggered terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 207,000 residents
per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the
agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
In 2023, RTD employed 2,815 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight-county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride”, fixed route bus and commuter rail services employing 1,660 individuals. Besides
its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding
purchased transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood,
and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities
of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation
established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the financial reporting
entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried Employee 401(a)
Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget
sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service,
and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot
legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All RTD
departments are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager and CEO
on or before August of each year. The General Manager and CEO uses these requests as the

starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager and CEO then presents
this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15. The Board of
Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a final budget
no later than December 31.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain line-item transfers
within the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplementary Information
Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region, which is considered as the Denver metropolitan area. It is
the most populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in
the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse
mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a
geographic balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2024 report forecasts that the outlook for the
economy is stable. Although economic activity has remained fairly steady while persistent inflation
exceeding historical averages and a tight labor market are expected to continue to present
challenges.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators for the Denver Metro Area:

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a constitutional amendment known as
the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), that limits taxes, revenue, and spending for state and local
governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District
exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and
spending limitations for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of
the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains
outstanding for which full defeasance will occur in November 2024 which will result in

REGIONAL TRANSPORATION DISTRICT
Introduction
December 31, 2023 and 2022

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and
use tax rate from 0.6% for the Base System to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the
FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any
revenue and spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income
generated by the increased tax revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital
improvements included in the FasTracks program. After the FasTracks debt is repaid in 2050,
the District’s 0.4% sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit
system financed through FasTracks and the TABOR restriction exemption will expire beginning in
2051.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP),
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement forecasting plan for RTD including both
the Base System and FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation
planning program for the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), the Metropolitan Planning Organization. While the MTFP is developed
separately for the Base System and FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium
and long-range Financial Plan which includes the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial
information forms the basis for the development of RTD’s annual budget. In October 2023, the
Board of Directors approved the 2024-2029 MTFP.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
initiatives and activities, and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with RTD’s 20212026 Strategic Plan.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management.

9
Packet Pg. 43

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

approximately 50% of RTD’s revenues being subject to TABOR growth limitations beginning in
2025.

15.A.a

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 found
no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its Base System and FasTracks sales
and use taxes. Base System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors
Service as “Aa1”, by Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
FasTracks Bonds that are secured by a first lien on the Districts 0.4% sales tax and a subordinate
lien on the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard and
Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
cash and liquidity tier investments for the year was 5.1%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile, general liability, and felonious
assault. RTD is self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $424,000 per person and
$1,195,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute for
claims arising on or after January 1, 2022. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation
claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this covered by purchased insurance up
to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a commuter rail railroad
liability policy of $323,000,000 to cover the cap on damages set by federal law; a Commercial
Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)

OTHER INFORMATION
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. RTD will submit its 2023 Report for award
of this Certificate.
To receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish
an easily readable and efficiently organized Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the contents
of which must conform to program standards. This report must also satisfy both GAAP and
applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. It is my belief the current Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report meets the program’s requirements, hence the impending
submittal.
Acknowledgements: Timely preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report was
made possible by the dedicated services of the Finance Department led by Doug MacLeod, Chief
Financial Officer. I extend my sincere appreciation to each member of the department for their
contributions. Moreover, I thank the Board of Directors for its governance.

Sincerely,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Report on the Audits of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the enterprise fund and aggregate remaining fund information of
Regional Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements,
as listed in the table of contents.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the enterprise fund and aggregate remaining fund information of Regional
Transportation District as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the respective changes in its financial position
and, where applicable, its cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The financial statements of the Salaried
Pension Plan were not audited under Government Auditing Standards.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation,
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern
for 12 months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise
substantial doubt shortly thereafter.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and, therefore, is not
a guarantee that audits conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a
substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the financial statements.

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
In performing audits in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audits.
error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are

appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that
we identified during the audits.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplementary information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management
and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in
an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information
and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide
us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Other Supplementary Information
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise Regional Transportation District's basic financial statements. The supplementary information, as
identified in the table of contents, is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of
the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and
relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements.
The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial
statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial
statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.
The other information comprises the introductory and statistical sections but does not include the basic financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

consideration of Regional Transportation District's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The
purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Regional

required to describe it in our report.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of its financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in RTD’s financial position. It should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of
dollars.
Financial Highlights
Following the COVID-19 Pandemic as well as completion of several transit service expansionary projects,
RTD has undertaken several initiatives such as implementation of a System Optimization Plan and the 20212026 Strategic Plan. Strategic Priorities encapsulated within the Strategic Plan include RTD providing
Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and Financial Success. Strategic Initiatives
created from the Strategic Priorities include a focus on providing a Welcoming Transit Environment, People
Power and Back to Basics as RTD continues to migrate from completion of the large FasTracks expansionary
projects to redirecting additional efforts to operations and maintenance.
Inflation and supply chain issues continue to be challenging for RTD and mitigation efforts through
contractual arrangements have avoided any material disruptions while also supporting budget certainty.
Public Transit services are highly dependent on people power and significant efforts have been undertaken
to shore-up chronic front-line staffing shortfalls which have been endemic throughout the industry.
Focusing on people power has resulted in steady improvements in reducing vacancies while mitigating
service disruptions. RTD has also implemented significant improvements to enhance personal security for
employees and customers which has proven challenging in the past due to societal issues. RTD has
expanded its transit police force and outreach efforts while reducing reliance on contracted security services.
Several debt refinancings for interest savings over recent years has reduced debt service requirements. In
addition, the remaining open pension plan was closed to new employees in January 2023 and replaced by
a defined contribution plan. An 18-month fare study and equity analysis was undertaken to respond to
stakeholder feedback which emphasized fare affordability, fare system simplicity and equity. Modifications
to RTD’s fare structure resulting from this study were implemented in January 2024. Each of these items
have resulted in significant improvements while also reducing financial risk and improving RTD’s financial
results and position.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,577,526 and $3,558,484, respectively. The amount of
unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2023, was $566,708 compared to $480,405 in 2022. RTD’s
2023 unrestricted net position was positively impacted by positive cash flows resulting from efficient
expenditures in alignment with the Strategic Plan, reduced debt service, improved investment returns and
cash funding for state of good repair needs while year-over-year revenue remained flat.
The net position of RTD increased by $19,042 (0.5%) during the current year compared to an increase of
$96,068 (2.8%) in the previous year. The increase in 2023 resulted from the aforementioned efforts while
2022 was positively impacted by final draws from COVID-19 federal grant relief apportionments.
RTD is heavily reliant on sales and use tax collections. Collections in 2023 were flat compared to 2022;
however, improvements in investment returns and additional grant revenue collections assisted in offsetting
increases in expenditures. Transit boarding decreases during COVID-19 and shifting travel patterns have

RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were flat in
2023 compared to 2022 which was expected after a significant recovery in collections following the economic
recovery from COVID-19 impacts. A portion of RTD’s revenue collections will be subject to TABOR revenue
growth limitations beginning in 2025 and RTD is undertaking efforts to diversify its revenue portfolio while
also seeking options to mitigate potential impacts of TABOR.
For 2023, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $1,052,717 compared to a loss of $971,674 for 2022. The increase in operating loss for
2023 was primarily due to increased operating expenses from restored services, contractual wage increases,
increased contracted services costs and recognition of additional expenses associated with retirement plans.
RTD anticipates operating losses each year, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use
tax, grant revenues and other miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $125,292 (4.2%) and decreased $223,814 (6.9%) in 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Outstanding debt decreased in 2023 and 2022 due to payment of outstanding principal
balances through scheduled debt service and refinancing of certain outstanding obligations for interest
savings and reduction of outstanding principal.
Capital grants and local contributions increased $38,035 (241.1%) in 2023 after decreasing $1,523 (8.9%)
in 2022. The increase in 2023 was a result of reconciling remaining, outstanding expenditures and drawing
grant funding under the FasTracks project as it winds down to completion.
Grant operating assistance decreased $72,554 (23.6%) in 2023 as COVID-19 relief apportionments have
ended. Grant operating assistance increased $7,990 (2.7%) in 2022 due to continued COVD-19 federal
assistance. This federal COVID-19 relief funding was 100% drawn at the end of 2023 and no additional
similar COVID-19 operating assistance grants are anticipated.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $238,499 (4.0%) in 2023 and decreased $337,952
(5.4%) in 2022 primarily due to depreciation.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting are used. Revenue is recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.
The statements of net position present information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net

resulted in only 5% of fare revenue as a total of all revenues. This has not contributed to unexpected
financial constraints and requires no significant financial adjustments since fares have historically comprised
a relatively small percentage of revenue.

15.A.a

position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position present information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital
grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows report cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,342 square mile area (District) in
and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and a 0.4%
sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services
in the Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax was used to fund the FasTracks build-out program and
provide funding for operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced
transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local
financial assistance, investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

In 2023, current assets increased by $84,656 (9.61%) primarily due to increased outstanding grants
receivable due to reconciliation of outstanding expenditures remaining on the FasTracks project as well as
improved returns on investments.
In 2023, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $238,499 (4%) primarily due to the
depreciation of assets.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $230,255 (5.6%) in 2023 primarily due to reduction of debt
through refinancings for interest savings.
The net position of RTD increased by $19,042 (.5%) during 2023 compared to an increase of $96,068
(2.8%) in the previous year. The lower increase in 2023 was due to sales tax revenues leveling out and the
expiration of federal funding related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in addition to increases in net pension

The information contained in the following condensed information tables is used as the basis for the revenue
and expense discussion surrounding RTD’s activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, 2022
and 2021.

15.A.a

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 4.9% of total revenues in 2023 and 5.8% in 2022,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares decreased by $11,758 (15.6%) in 2023 compared
to a decrease of $3,631 (4.6%) in 2022. The decrease in both years was due to the Zero Fare for Better
Air program which allowed customers to use RTD services with no fare for two months in 2023 and one
month in 2022 through a state sponsored grant program, leading to state grant funding received to replace
the lost fare revenue and recognized as grant revenue. Ridership remained relatively flat in both years and
no fare changes were enacted.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.1% and 0.2% of total revenues in
2023 and 2022. Advertising and other income decreased $1,188 (43.9%) in 2023 compared to a decrease
of $1,490 (35.5%) in 2022. The decreases in both years were primarily due to the advertising contract
being treated as a lease under GASB 87 and the associated revenue being reclassified to nonoperating
income.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 66.6% and 66.3% of RTD’s total revenues in 2023 and
2022, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated combined 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the
District. Sales and use tax increased $2,987 (0.3%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $98,172 (13.0%)
The accelerated growth in spending experienced in 2022 slowed significantly in 2023, leading to a minimal
increase in sales and use tax revenues.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 18.2% and 23.8% of total revenues
in 2023 and 2022. Grant operating assistance decreased $72,554 (23.6%) in 2023 compared to an increase
of $98,172 (13.0%) in 2022. The increase in 2022 resulted from drawing remaining outstanding grant
apportionments awarded to RTD for COVID relief. The 2023 decrease occurred due to the exhaustion of
the additional COVID relief grant funding during 2022.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 4.5% and -0.1% of total revenues in 2023 and 2022.
Investment income increased $59,115 (5,890.3%) in 2023 compared to a decrease of $3,405 (-141.8%) in
2022. The increase in 2023 resulted from increased investable funds combined with higher fixed income
yields. The decrease in 2022 resulted from mark-to-market adjustments with rising interest rates.

15.A.a

Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.4% and 2.7% of total revenues in
2023 and 2022. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. Other income decreased $16,835 (1.4%) in 2023 compared to an increase
of $22,372 (186.5%) in 2022. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the receipt of a returned credit
risk premium associated with a prior year federal loan culminating in a decrease in 2023 due to the onetime occurrence of this receipt.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 4.2% and 1.2%
of total revenues in 2023 and 2022. Capital grants and local contributions increased $38,035 (243.1%) in
2023 and decreased $1,523 (-8.9%) in 2022. The increase in 2023 resulted from final reconciliation and
closure of grants remaining from the FasTracks expansion program while the decrease in 2022 resulted due
to a timing issue as grant close-outs were finalized.

Salaries and wages – Other than depreciation, salary and wage expense is the largest expense category
accounting for 19.7% and 19.1.% of the total RTD expenses in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Salary and
wage expenses increased by $21,921 (9.6%) in 2023 compared to a increase of $42,248 (22.8%) in 2022.
The increase in both years was primarily due to contracted wage increase and inflationary adjustments.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 8.9% and 8.8% of total expenses in 2023 and 2022. Fringe
benefits increased by $8,641 (8.2%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $44,166 (72.9%) in 2021.
Increases are primarily tied to wages through payroll taxes in addition to inflationary increases for benefits
such as health and welfare. In addition, the large increase in 2022 was due to recognition of higher pension
liabilities resulting from investment market underperformance.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 4.2% of the total
expenses in 2023 and 3.7% in 2022. Materials and supplies expenses increased $9,708 (22.2%) in 2023
compared to an increase of $4,251 (10.7%) in 2022. The increase in both years primarily resulted from
higher-than-normal inflation and supply-chain constraints.
Services – Services expense accounted for 7.7% of total expenses in 2023 and 6.9% 2022. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense increased
$14,707 (17.8%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $8,305 (11.2%) in 2022. The higher increase in 2022
resulted from restoration of some service and both years incurred increases due to inflation.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.5% of total expenses in both 2023 and 2022. Utilities expense includes
electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as traction power for
rail lines. Utilities expense increased $1,109 (6.0%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $922 (5.3%) in
2022. These increases are primarily the result of inflationary pressures rather than changes in volume of
utilities consumed.

Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% of total expenses in both 2023 and 2022. Insurance expense
includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as the
premium cost for excess insurance lines, cybersecurity and railroad liability insurance. Insurance expense
increased $928 (7.0%) in 2023 and increased $3,117 (30.8%) in 2022. The increase in 2023 resulted from
adverse claims experience while the increase in 2022 was due to state increases in the caps for liability,
higher worker’s compensation reserves and restoration of some service.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 17.6% and
16.4% of the total expenses in 2023 and 2022. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for Bus, Commuter Rail, Access-a-Ride, and FlexRide services. Purchased
transportation costs increased $27,333 (13.9%) in 2023 and increased $21,269 (12.2%) in 2022. The
increase in 2023 was driven by expiration of certain large, fixed route contracts with inflationary increases
included in the new contracts. The increase in 2022 was due to some restoration of service and contractual
increases.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.2% and 0.1% of total expenses in
2023 and 2022, respectively. Leases and rentals expense increased $952 (61.8%) in 2023 compared to a
decrease of $103 (-6.3%) in 2022. This category of expense is relatively immaterial and tends to fluctuate
with vacancy changes.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other
defined categories and accounted for 0.3% of total expenses in 2023 and 2022. Miscellaneous expenses
increased $1,135 (34.8%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $1,050 (47.4%) in 2022. This category
includes additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 26.8% and 30.0% of the total expenses
in 2023 and 2022, respectively. RTD’s depreciation expense is a straight-line non-cash systematic allocation
of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense decreased
$18,337 (5.1%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $15,040 (4.4%) in 2022. The decrease in 2023 primarily
resulted from certain assets reaching full depreciation while the increase in 2022 was due to recognition of
amortization expenses related to GASB 87.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 10.6% and 11.6% of the total expenses
in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense decreased $3,729 (2.7%) in 2023 and decreased $15,759
(10.2%) in 2022. The decrease in both years was attributable to lower outstanding balances resulting from
paying down principal as well as refinancing of debt for interest savings.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.4% and 0.6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other expenses
increased $11,995 (232.7%) in 2023 and decreased $1,667 (24.6%) in 2022. The changes in both years
resulted from activity related to retirement of capital assets.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include land and right-of-way, buildings and improvements,
leasehold improvements, revenue and non-revenue vehicles, shop and service equipment, security and
surveillance equipment, computer equipment, and furniture. RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of

Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bonds, certificates of participation, a
purchase and assignment agreement and a lease liability as a result of the implementation of Government
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 87. The 2023 outstanding debt was $2,884,276 compared
to $3,009,568 in 2022. Outstanding debt decreased by $125,291 (4.2%) in 2023 and decreased by $223,814
(6.9%) in 2022. The decrease in both years was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt with the
outstanding debt in both years also decreasing due to the completion of several refinancings for interest
savings.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by pledged future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue
bonds were $2,292,445 and $2,360,680 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sales tax
revenue bonds decreased $68,235 (2.8%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $303,805 (14.8%) in 2022.
The decrease in 2023 was the result of the issuance of Series 2023A bonds, the proceeds from which were
used to refinance other debt issuances for interest savings. The increase in 2022 was a result of the
issuance of taxable (convertible to tax-exempt) Series 2022AB bonds, the proceeds from which were used
to refinance other debt issuances for interest savings.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations
issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation and component unit of
RTD. Certificates are lease-purchase financial obligations secured by the underlying assets. Outstanding
Certificates were issued with the proceeds being used to acquire certain equipment, facilities and
infrastructure to be used by RTD. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its
own debt. Certificates outstanding were $377,596 and $453,994 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $76,398 (16.8%) in 2023 compared to a decrease of
$501,788 (52.5%) in 2022. The decrease in both years is due to payment of outstanding principal and
refinancings for interest savings.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2023 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 69.9% and 66.2% of the total revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect the level of funding available to
RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2023 sales and use taxes increased 0.3% from the prior year indicating a
slowdown and recessionary pressure experienced in the local Denver economy compared to the substantial
increases seen 2022.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 5.8% of total revenues in both 2023 and 2022. Passenger fare collections decreased in both
years due to planned programs to require no fares from customers during certain periods of each year.
Lost fare revenue due to these programs was replaced with Colorado state grants in both years.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 18.2% and 23.8% of total revenues in 2023
and 2022, respectively. These grant apportionments primarily result from information provided by transit
agencies to the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) National Transit Database (NTD). This funding was
larger in 2022 due to additional COVID relief grants.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a State Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to
implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at
least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended
requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003,
the Bill was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated
by private transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a
system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
General Manager and CEO appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority
serves as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14), as
amended, which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the
primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the
underlying financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a blended component
unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. No
financial activity occurred during 2023 or 2022, and no separately audited financial
statements were prepared either year, for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds
GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried
Pension Plan and RTD Salaried 401(a) Retirement Plan meet these fiduciary criteria and has

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)
included the financial activity of each in 2023 and 2022 in the financial statement section of
this report.

The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its
presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted
resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

3. Basis of Accounting

15.A.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Accounts receivables are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other contractual
arrangements including unspent bond proceeds.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess
of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses
and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata shares of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
Prior to 2020, interest was capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of
participation from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount
of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted)
interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest
earnings on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated
by weighted average construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively was $134,609
and $138,337.
11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10-20 years
30 years
8-25 years
3-10 years

15.A.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized
as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence
is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have been earned
but not paid, have been included as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket books and day pass
tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Stored value sales are evaluated for
revenue recognition at the time services are performed. Sales of college-based passes,
which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned revenue
then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered.
Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given
year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of
each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of months of
the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable
sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the
District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series
2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021A, 2021B, 2022A,
2022B and 2023A bond resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of
debt service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of

12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources

15.A.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax
revenues in the amount of approximately $3,609,347 through 2050. Principal and interest
paid for the current year were $111,745 and pledged revenues received were $858,133.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). Grants are also awarded to RTD by the State of Colorado through
the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state governments issue
grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $39,216 and $12,490 in 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $234,488 and $307,042 in 2023 and
2022, respectively. Other contributed revenue was $14,465 and $3,156 in 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
RTD was awarded additional COVID-19 relief funding of $53,241 through the American
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Additional Assistance in July 2022. These funds were expended
and drawn in 2023.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and
guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate
measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides
a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local
governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments after considering past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.

Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years after 1994 for declared emergencies.
19. Leases-GASB 87
RTD is a lessee for noncancellable leases of land, office space and equipment. RTD
recognizes a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the
statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease liability at the present
value of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is
initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs.
Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Key estimates and judgments related to leases include how RTD determines (1) the
discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease
term, and (3) lease payments.
•

•

RTD uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When
the interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, RTD generally uses its
estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments
included in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed
payments and purchase option price that RTD is reasonably certain to exercise.

RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected
to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability.
Lease assets are reported with other capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with
the short-term portion combined with long-term debt and the long-term portion is stated
separately on the statement of net position. RTD is a lessor for noncancellable leases of
buildings, land, office space, parking space and use of RTD physical resources for
advertising space. RTD recognizes a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources in
the statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease receivable at the present
value of payments expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments received. The deferred
inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable,
adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date.

Key estimates and judgments include how RTD determines the discount rate it uses to
discount the expected lease receipts to present value, lease term, and lease receipts.
•

•

RTD uses the actual rate charged to lessees as the discount rate for leases.
When the interest rate charged to lessees is not provided, RTD generally uses
its estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease receipts
included in the measurement of the lease receivable is composed of fixed
payments from the lessee.

RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease receivable and deferred inflows of resources if certain
changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease receivable.
20. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 100
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB
Statement No. 100, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which enhances
the accounting and financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and
error corrections. The provisions of this statement are effective for RTD's financial
statements for the year ending December 31, 2024.

GASB 101
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB
Statement No. 101, Compensated Absences, which updates the recognition and
measurement guidance for compensated absences under a unified model. This
statement requires that liabilities for compensated absences be recognized for
leave that has not been used and leave that has been used but not yet paid in
cash or settled through noncash means and establishes guidance for measuring a
liability for leave that has not been used. It also updates disclosure requirements
for compensated absences. The provisions of this statement are effective for RTD's
financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024.

GASB 102
In December 2023, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 102, Certain Risk Disclosures, which requires a government to
assess whether a concentration or constraint makes the primary government or
other reporting units that report a liability for revenue debt vulnerable to the risk
of a substantial impact. It also requires a government to assess whether an event
or events associated with a concentration or constraint that could cause the
substantial impact have occurred, have begun to occur, or are more likely than not
to occur within 12 months of the date of the financial statements are issued. If
certain criteria are met for a concentration or constraint, disclosures are required

53

Packet Pg. 87

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is recognized as revenue over the life of the
lease term.

GASB 103
In April of 2024, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB
Statement No. 103, Financial Reporting Model Improvements. This statement
establishes new accounting and financial reporting requirements, or modifies
existing requirements, related to:
• Managements’ discussion and analysis
• Unusual or infrequent items
• Presentations of the proprietary fund statements of revenues, expenses,
and changes in fund net position
• Information about major component units in basic financial statements
• Budgetary comparison information
• Financial trends information in the statistical section
The provisions of this statement are effective for the RTD’s financial statements
ending December 31, 2026.

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under
this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged
collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in
escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by rule and
regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held
in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly
identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits
accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public depository has the right
at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained or pledged and is always
entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $6,454 and $13,436
collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent
but not in RTD’s name.

Fiduciary fund investments of $195,235 and $169,980 at December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, consist of a broad spectrum of individual holdings of cash and cash equivalents,
equity mutual funds and fixed income mutual funds. Because these investments are primarily
mutual funds consisting of multiple investments and contain equity investments, credit ratings
of the underlying portfolios are not available.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Enterprise Funds
It is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment funds
shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a
specific maturity, a specific issue, or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the
portfolio should, however, be flexible depending upon the outlook for the economy and the
securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted
investments. As of December 31, 2023, RTD followed these limits. As of December 31, 2022,
RTD was following limitations set out in RTD’s previous investment policy limitations.

1 In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such agency obligations below

the highest rating category, but no lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to
be invested in agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity
from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) (II) shall not
apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in
agencies, with any more than 25% being invested in any one agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal
documentation governing the transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment
policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum exposure limits listed above.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, RTD had $121,248 and $139,765 of cash and investments
that were restricted under the provisions of bond agreements.

Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No.
72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local
governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of
governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard
expands fair value disclosures to provide comprehensive information for financial statement
users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD
can access at the measurement date. Examples are derived values from the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ),
Chicago Board of Trade and “Pink Sheets”.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly on the measurement date. Examples include matrix pricing,
market corroborated pricing and inputs such as yield curves and indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on
the reporting entity's reasonably available information concerning the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including assumptions about risk.
Examples include investment manager pricing for private placement, private equities and hedge
funds.

(1) Real estate investment trusts invest primarily in commercial and residential real estate. The fund focuses on
properties with high quality physical improvements, stabilized occupancies and competitive positions within their
markets that produce a relatively high level of current income combined with moderate appreciation potential.
(2) The common collective trusts measured at the NAV invest primarily in asset-backed securities, corporate bonds,
U.S. government agency securities and foreign common stocks. The investment objectives include matching the
return of the Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index through investment in substantially all of the bonds contained in that
index and matching the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index (Net) benchmark.

Investments in Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share
RTD holds shares or interests in investment companies where the fair value of in the
investments is measured on a recurring basis using net asset value per share (or its
equivalent) of the investment companies as a practical expedient.
RTD’s investments in the Colorado Local Government Liquid Asset Trust (COLOTRUST)
are measured at the net asset value method. There are no unfunded commitments, the
redemption frequency is daily, and there is no redemption notice period. RTD’s
investment in COLOTRUST was $43,473 and $42,215 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
Investments in Entities That Calculate Amortized Cost
RTD’s investment in Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP) is measured at amortized cost
and, therefore, is not categorized in a level. The trust is similar to a money market fund, with
each share valued at $1.00. RTD’s investment in CSIP was $33,603 and $31,910 as of December
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

2022AB and 2023A are secured by a pledge of future sales and use tax revenues. These taxsecured future liabilities of $3,609,347 remain outstanding through 2050. The pledged revenue
includes a 0.6% and 0.4% tax on the net taxable sales made within the District and use taxes of
0.6% and 0.4% on items purchased for use inside the District. For the year 2023, these taxgenerated revenues were $858,133.
RTD’s Base System sales tax obligations are secured by a 0.6% sales and use tax. The Fastracks
bonds are secured by a 0.4% sales and use tax and a subordinate pledge from the 0.6% Base

ATU 1001 Pension Plan – Defined Benefit (2023)
Plan Description
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU) Pension Plan was established pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU. This plan covers substantially
all full-time union-represented employees in accordance with the CBA. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Compusys, Inc.

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected
by the participant and the spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the ATU Plan are paid to participants who have attained age
65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after attaining age 50. The ATU Plan was
subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011, for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, their beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest.
Prior to 2023, upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will
be paid in a lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary. One June 2, 2023, the Board
of Trustees agreed that the death benefit will no longer be paid out of the Pension Plan. This
benefit shall be paid pursuant to the ATU Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust effective January
1, 2023.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided they have worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An individual
will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social Security
Administration. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify for a
disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

*The ATU 1001 Pension Plan deferred outflow of resources related to contributions made after the
measurement date were $177,530. The Salaried Pension Plan deferred outflow of resources related to
contributions made after the measurement were $8,400.

An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided they had worked for
at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if they have worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and
terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years
of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after age

•

The benefit multiplier was changed from 1.0% to 2.0% effective January 1, 2022 with
the signing of the latest Collective Bargaining Agreement, retroactive to date of hire.
The employer contribution was increased from 13% to 15% effective January 1, 2022.
Regular retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 62 with 20
years of service
Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation
Vesting is changed from five years to 10 years
Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5.0% to 3.0%
The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 to 25 years

A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure
above when certain ATU Plan funding benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required
Contribution (ARC) is less than 11.0% of payroll, pension benefits would be restored in a certain
priority order.
On February 11, 2022, the Regional Transportation District and the Amalgamated Transit Union,
Local 1001, signed a Memorandum of Understanding where the parties agreed “the Employer is
obligated to pay benefits to eligible participants and beneficiaries pursuant to the Pension Plan
for as long as any such individual remains entitled to benefits under the terms of the Plan.”
Employees covered by the benefit terms for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2023 (December

Plan changes include an increased benefit multiplier for Tier 2
members and changes to the pay increases for the next three years.
The plan closed to new hires effective January 1, 2023. Employer
contribution rates are based on a CBA. Effective January 1, 2022, RTD
is contributing 15% of pay and members will contribute 5% of pay.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a Single Discount Rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
6.50%; the municipal bond rate is 4.05% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than
the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index”); and the resulting Single
Discount Rate is 6.50%.
The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate would be equal to the actuarially
determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future
benefit payments of current plan members.

Development of the Single Discount Rate
Single discount rate is 6.50%
Long-term expected rate of investment return is 6.50%
Long-term municipal bond rate is 4.05%

The rate of investment return on the market values of assets during the 2022 measurement
period was -11.59%. the rate of investment return on the actuarial value of assets was 5.06%,
which led to a $5,100 loss primarily due to worse than assumed investment experience.
The plan had a gain of $2,400 due to removal of the funeral benefit from the Pension Plan. The
plan had a loss of $14,400 under liabilities due to higher-than-expected salary increases for
continuing active members.

Contributions
Contributions are made in accordance with the CBA. The plan had contributions during the
measurement year of $176,239, including a one-time, lump sum payment of $160,000 in May
2022 following signing of the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement. Employer
contributions were increased to 15% as part of the new CBA from previous 13% contribution.
Employee contributions remain at 5%. RTD has included the full amount of the actuarially
determined net pension liability in accordance with financial reporting requirements. RTD is
current in making all required contributions under the CBA.

Pension Expense and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
For the year ended 2023 the employer recognized a pension expense increase of $32,890. The

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a single discount rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate would be equal to the actuarially
determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future
benefit payments of current plan members.

included an increase of employer contributions to 15% and a change in the benefit multiplier
from 1% to 2% retroactive to the date of hire. There was also an increase in the pension liability
under Change in Assumptions due to a decrease in the assumed discount rate. The discount rate
decreased to 6.50% in 2022 from 7.00% in 2021.

Salaried Pension Plan - Defined Benefit (2023)
Plan Description
The Regional Transportation District Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan provides coverage for all
full-time salaried employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2008. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Benesys.

Benefits Provided
Normal retirement eligibility age is 65 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit 2.5%
of average final compensation times credited service. Early retirement age is 55 with five years
of credited service, the monthly benefit if one retires or terminates from active status on or after
age 55 is reduced 1/30 for each year less than age 60. If the employee terminates from active
status prior to age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/15 for each year between ages
60 and 65 and 1/30 for each year less than age 60.
The disability provisions apply to fully vested participants who are totally and permanently
disabled and entitled to a Social Security disability award. The payout amount is the unreduced
accrued normal pension retirement, payable upon approval for Social Security disability.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service, otherwise a lump sum payment will be
made equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits payable in lieu of all other
benefits.
Forms of annuity payments for normal retirement are 50% joint and survivor if married, otherwise
retirement benefits are for a single annuity with no survivor option. Optional forms of retirement
benefits are 25%, 50%, 66-2/3% or 100% joint and survivor annuity with five-year or ten-year
certain and life annuity.

Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and
completed months in the year of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for
retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is the average of the participant's
highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service
immediately preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the RTD’s salaried employees’ base compensation. Due to the decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding
policy effective January 1, 2013, where the recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1
million is made to the Trust each year. This funding policy was established with the goal of
achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032; however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board
adopted a new funding policy effective in 2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed
for an amount to be contributed to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations
from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended
contribution can fluctuate annually due to such factors as projected total base compensation,
investment results, and retirement patterns of participants. RTD contributed $15 million in 2023
and $8.4 million in 2022.

The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with a date of January 1,
2022 using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the
measurement with a liability roll forward to the measurement date of December 31, 2022:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment Rate of Return

2.75%
3.70% – 6.45%, age-based
7.00%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year
Ending December 31, 2023) are summarized in the following table and reflect assumed long-term

December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not
incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

The following presents the net pension liability as of December 31, 2023 calculated using

the total pension liability. The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year taxexempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

RTD Plan – 401(a) Defined Contribution
The RTD defined contribution plan is available for full-time salaried employees hired after January
1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted Amendment 8, effective January 1, 2008 for which RTD
currently contributes the board approved 9% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Contributions
totaled $7,813 and $7,191 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to
this plan. Membership was 849 and 710 active employees in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
RTD/ATU 1001 401(a) Defined Contribution Plan and 457 (b) Deferred Compensation
Plan
This plan became available for new members of ATU 1001 hired on or after January 1, 2023.
Eligible employees include any newly hired member of the ATU who are 19 years old in addition
to Part Time Retirees (as defined in the CBA). Eligibility for the 457 (b) plan begins on the first
day of the month following completion of election form for Pre-tax and/or Roth contributions to
the Plan. Eligibility for the 401(a) Plan begins on the employee’s date of hire or immediately for
Part-Time Retirees. Contributions under the 457 (b) Plan can be made by the employee up to

Contributions) to the 457(b) plan will be matched by RTD equal to 100% up to 5% of the
employee’s per-pay-period compensation. Employees are always fully vested under the 457(b)
plan. Under the ATU 401(a) plan, 20% vesting will occur for each full year of completed service,
with 100% vesting occurring after five years of completed service, upon attaining age of 65, or
upon death or disability. Part-time Retirees are fully always vested. 2023 contributions by RTD
under the 401(a) plan were $896. RTD made an additional match of $281 to the 457(b) plan.
Employee contributions during 2023 to the 457(b) plan were $315. As of December 31, 2023,
there were 369 employees participating in the plan.
Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust (Trust) was formed
pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971 between Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Local 1001 and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver, through
July 3, 1974 and RTD thereafter. In addition to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of
other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust benefits. The Trust
agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there
continues to be a CBA between the ATU and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability)
for represented employees of RTD and certain officers of the ATU and health care benefits for
retired employees who actively worked 600 hours or more per quarter. The Trust is funded
through contributions by the employer and employee in which the share of benefit plan
contributions is set by the CBA. RTD’s contribution was $26,524 and $23,877 for the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for
felonious assault for each employee. The Trust self-insures part of its health, life insurance and
short-term disability benefits. The Trust issues audited financial statements which include
financial information for the plan. Those audited financial statements may be obtained from the
Trust: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado
80014-2602.
Other Post Employment Benefits
Prior to the closure of the ATU 1001 Pension plan to new hires beginning January 1, 2023 there
was a $2 funeral benefit paid to survivors of retirees when they die. To ensure this benefit
continues to be available to all ATU members, regardless of their hire date, trustees of the plan
voted in 2023 to move this benefit out of the pension plan and into the Health and Welfare plan
discussed above. After an actuarial review, RTD has determined that the net OPEB liability is not
material and therefore did not apply the provisions of GASB 74 or 75.

RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (Plan), created in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees (with the
exception below) and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years.
Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon
termination, retirement, death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial
hardship. RTD makes no contributions to this plan as contributions are voluntarily made by RTD

Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle
of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay.

Contingencies

RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
reviews by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Although the outcome of any such review
cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these reviews will not result in liabilities to such
an extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.

Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported
when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee
benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident for claims arising on or after January 1, 2018, and
before January 1, 2022. For claims that arise on or after January 1, 2022, RTD’s liability is limited
to $424 per person and $1,195 per occurrence.
For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims more
than $2,000. The number of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.

RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not

the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to several pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or
labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.
In 2018, Denver Transit Partners, LLC (DTP), RTD’s concessionaire for its Eagle P3 Project, filed
a lawsuit asserting force majeure and change in law claims and damages of approximately $111
million against RTD. DTP claimed that the Colorado Public Utilities Commission and/or the Federal
Railroad Administration created new interpretations of existing regulations and that DTP was
therefore entitled to risk allocation in its favor of costs incurred. A four-week bench trial on the
claims began on September 21, 2020. On February 10, 2023, the court issued its Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order for Entry of Judgment finding in favor of RTD on DTP’s above
claims. DTP filed its notice of appeal on March 30, 2023. Briefing in the Colorado Court of Appeals
was completed on January 23, 2024, and oral argument was held on April 16, 2024. DTP also
filed a bill of costs against RTD as the prevailing party on RTD’s counterclaims for approximately
$2.2 million, which costs were denied by the court. On May 9, the Colorado Court of Appeals
issued its opinion affirming the District Court’s judgement in RTD’s favor, agreeing that regulators
applied existing law and no change in law occurred. In response to the May 9 decision by the
Colorado Court of Appeals, DTP filed a petition for a rehearing on May 22, 2024. The court’s
response to the latest petition has not been issued as of the date of this report.

for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager and CEO submits to the Board of
Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, which must also approve subsequent amendments not delegated under the authority
of the General Manager and CEO. In the absence of such budget adoption and appropriation by
the Board of Directors, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures in the new fiscal year
that are limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget
transfers authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain transfers within the budget
as delegated by the Board of Directors.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning Amendment 1 through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the
voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined
in Amendment 1 for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast and
Southwest Corridor light rail projects or to operate such projects for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual
revenue and expenses is as follows:

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit

97

Packet Pg. 131

improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment, income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid in 2050, RTD’s 0.4% sales and
use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through
FasTracks.
Beginning in 2025, RTD’s revenues, with exception of federal funding and the 0.4% sales and
use tax, will be subject to annual growth limitations constrained by the local Consumer Price
Index (CPI) plus the change in property tax assessments due to new construction. It is estimated
that approximately 50% of total revenues will be subject to this provision. RTD is undertaking
measures to mitigate, to the extent possible, any adverse impacts these growth limitations will
have on funding.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Following an 18-month fare study and equity analysis, RTD implemented certain changes to its
fare structure effective at the beginning of 2024 to simplify the fare structure, reduce fares, and
ensure equity. Because fare revenue comprises a relatively small proportion of total revenues,
RTD does not anticipate these changes to have a material impact to its ability to fund necessary
expenditures and has budgeted accordingly.
On Wednesday, February 14, 2024, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE)
held an election to determine whether eligible Transit Police Officers and Corporals employed by
RTD would be represented by the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #72 (FOP 72) for purposes of
collective bargaining. On Thursday, February 15, 2024, RTD’s General Counsel’s office received
formal notification of the election’s results from CDLE staff, which certified that the eligible voters
elected to form a Collective Bargaining Unit. RTD Labor Relations staff with support from RTD
Police Department command staff are working collectively with the FOP 72 to negotiate and
implement this first-time collective bargaining agreement.
On May 9, 2024, RTD received notice of the court’s decision in response to RTD’s concessionaire,
Denver Transit Partners’ (DTP’s), appeal of the February 10, 2023 Findings of Fact, Conclusions
of Law and Order for Entry of Judgement finding in favor of RTD. The Colorado Court of Appeals
issued its opinion affirming the District Court’s judgement in RTD’s favor, agreeing that regulators
applied existing law and no change in law occurred. In response the court’s May 9, 2024 decision,
DTP filed a petition of rehearing on May 22, 2024. The court has not responded to this petition
as of the date of this report.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis and Zero Fare for Youth
Program Continuation

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to concurrently adopt the continuance of the Zero Fare for Youth
(ZFY) program and the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the ZFY proposed fare change to comply
with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Carl Green Jr, Director, Civil Rights Division
Monika Treipl-Harnke, Senior Manager, Revenue
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B. In this circular, the FTA requires transit
agencies, such as RTD, to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those
changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The
continuance of the ZFY program meets the definition of a fare change. Thus, an analysis is required to
be brought before the Board for approval. The complete final Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report is
included in Attachment A.
During the June 11, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the 12-month pilot program from September 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, with the
intention of continuing the ZFY program for the following school year. The discussion item included
information about increased youth boardings, estimated forgone youth revenue, and the potential for
grant funding through Senate Bill 24-032 (SB032).
DISCUSSION
In adopting the continuance of the ZFY program, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff have now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare change
and final Title VI fare equity analysis. Consequently, the proposed fare change is ready for the Board’s
consideration. The following discussion is divided into six sections outlining the following:

Packet Pg. 173

1. Final Title VI fare equity analysis findings
2. Community outreach activities
3. Feedback on Staff’s recommendation
4. Final recommendation summary
5. Projected youth ridership and forgone fare revenue
6. Implementation
1. Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies, and notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population. As
a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare
per boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their
average fare with the proposed change. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the
establishment of a longer-term ZFY program following the conclusion of the pilot.
2. Community Outreach Activities
Public outreach events regarding the continuation of the ZFY program were held in conjunction with
public meetings regarding the upcoming September 2024 service changes. RTD hosted five in-person
open houses and one virtual public meeting between June 18-26, 2024, to communicate the proposed
changes, answer questions, and collect feedback from customers, stakeholders, and the community. In
addition to these public meetings, staff were available to answer questions about the proposed
extension of the ZFY program during its participation at community events. The public outreach
activities comport with the Federal Transit Administration’s Title VI Requirements and Guidelines and are
illustrated in Section 7 of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
3. Feedback on Staff’s Recommendation
Through the outreach process, significant support was provided for the continuance of the ZFY program.
The following themes regarding the program were present in the feedback:
•
•
•
•
•

Supports youth in accessing school and work
Benefits families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who
see driving as a more affordable option
Meets climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provides youth with independence and agency
Encourages lifelong transit use

4. Final Recommendation Summary
The Board’s adoption of the proposed fare structure would continue the no-cost fare for youth through
August 31, 2025. For comparison purposes, the tables following provide a summary of the existing pilot
fare structure alongside the fare structure for customers, ages 19 and under, without ZFY.

Packet Pg. 174

15.B

Pilot Fare Structure

Fare Structure without ZFY

Incorporated into staff’s recommendation, youth customers would be able to travel to any destination,
including Denver International Airport, at no cost.
5. Projected Youth Ridership and Forgone Fare Revenue
With a ZFY program, youth boardings in 2025 are estimated to be 13.9 million. Estimated youth
ridership for the subsequent years, should a ZFY program continue beyond 2025, is shown in the table
below.

Packet Pg. 175

15.B

The forgone fare revenue in 2025 due to a ZFY program is estimated to be $2.9 million. Estimated
forgone fare revenue for the subsequent years is shown in the following table.

*RTD fares decreased on January 1, 2024
SB032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up
to $5 million to RTD in FY2024-25, provided that the agency applies for the grant. Should RTD apply
and be approved for this grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in
ridership, provide operating support for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for
other expenses necessary to implement and measure the effectiveness of the program. This includes but
is not limited to reasonable marketing expenses and expenses incurred conducting customer surveys.
In addition to the forgone youth revenue estimated above, additional funds will be necessary to continue
the ZFY program for marketing awareness and informational reminders across RTD’s transit network,
language assistance and effective communications, a survey for youth customers or their guardians, and
an annual report. RTD estimates these costs to total approximately $410,000 from September 1, 2024
– August 31, 2025. Therefore, the $5 million in available grant funding is expected to offset forgone
revenue as well as additional expenses continuation of a ZFY program from September 1, 2024 through
August 31, 2025.
6. Implementation
In order to be eligible for state grant funding, RTD will need to apply to the Colorado Energy Office.
Details on the grant program are not yet available, but RTD is working closely with the Colorado Energy
Office to understand the grant terms and process for receiving funding.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As noted in the Discussion section of this report, the recommendation would result in forgone fare
revenue of approximately $2,900,000 as well as estimated costs of $410,000, for a total financial
impact of $3,310,000. The financial impact would be fully offset by the grant established by SB032,
should RTD apply for and be awarded the grant. The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will
not result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.

1 Introduction
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
On June 2, 2023, RTD formally requested authorization to proceed with a 12-month Zero Fare for Youth pilot, as
well as a time extension for completing a fare equity analysis of a potential permanent Zero Fare for Youth change
since the pilot extends beyond the normal six-month period allowed under Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
rules. The FTA approved RTD's Title VI Fare Equity Analysis extension request on June 22, 2023, in order to ensure
all critical tasks associated with the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program were completed. This analysis of the Zero
Fare for Youth program was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV and Appendix K of
FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare change
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare change.

2 Overview of Proposed Fare Change
On July 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new fare structure, policies and programs that included
the one year of no-cost transit for youth throughout the district. The fare changes 1 were developed as part of
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, a yearlong review aimed at creating a fare structure
that is more equitable, affordable and simple. Most of the fare changes were implemented in early 2024.
The Zero Fare for Youth pilot program was made available for youth customers September 2023 through August
2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, are eligible for participation in
the pilot. RTD is funding the financial impact resulting from implementation of a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program
for the first year. For long-term sustainability, RTD sought out funding partners to support the continuation of the
program after the pilot. RTD will be positioned to adopt this zero-fare offering if funding is secured.
In January 2024, Colorado lawmakers introduced Senate Bill (SB) 24-032 Methods to Increase the Use of Transit.
SB-032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up to $5 million

to RTD in FY2024-25, provided that the agency applies for the grant. Should RTD apply and be approved for this
grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in ridership, provide operating support
for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for other expenses necessary to implement and
measure the effectiveness of the program.
On May 14, 2024, staff presented a discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee regarding the draft
results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the FTA
Circular 4702.1B. The continuance of the ZFY program meets the definition of a fare change. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for consideration and approval.
On June 11, 2024, staff presented a discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee regarding the results
of the 12-month pilot program from September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024 with the intention of continuing
the ZFY program for the following school year. The discussion item included information about increased youth
boardings, estimated forgone youth revenue, and the potential for grant funding through SB 24-032.
Staff have now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare change and final
Title VI fare equity analysis. Thereby, the proposed fare change to continue the ZFY program will be brought
forward on July 23, 2024 for the Board’s consideration and approval.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 2 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.
RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).

15.B.a
July 2, 2024

Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

4 Fare Equity Analysis Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected. 3 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 4
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority

or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Throughout the document, the following definitions are used:
●
●

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

4.1 Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction
Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the 2019 CSS sample size was smaller than
the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption, which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes. The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any ridership
changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure of rider sensitivity to changes in fare
rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions are essential to modeling anticipated
ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but are often excluded from fare equity analyses.
Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a segment of customers prior to a fare
change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in average fare. This calculation becomes
unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract new customers to the system or from
other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to compare the average fare impacts of the fare
changes on the same segment of customers after the change in pricing and policies.

4.1.1 Demographic Data
For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys. RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger
sample of completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic
fare adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched
– MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers.

4.1.2 Demographic Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.
Low response rates for some rider categories, fare levels and fare payment types, as well as the absence of some
fare payment options on the survey pose several challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address the
limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.
The following demographic assumptions are used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, because 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

4.1.3 Additional Average Fare Analysis Assumptions
Assumptions were made regarding the impact of the Zero Fare for Youth program on the EcoPass programs;
namely, the Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass program customers. The EcoPass programs are universal pass
programs, where all (or the vast majority) of a business, neighborhood or college are required to participate. By
having a large group of participants with varying levels of utilization of the system under a single contract, RTD
can continue to charge the contracted entity only for those trips that are taken. But when that cost is spread
across a large group of customers, it results in a relatively affordable rate per customer. In all three cases, the
utilization of the system multiplied by a fare rate is the fundamental determinant of contract pricing, although the
specific calculation steps differ slightly for each Pass Program.
With the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth policy, the utilization of younger customers eligible for the Zero
Fare for Youth program is expected to be excluded from the Pass Program pricing calculation, thereby resulting in
a lower contract amount. For a number of the Neighborhood EcoPass contracts and nearly all CollegePass
contracts, this is expected to result in a notable decrease in future contract pricing. For business EcoPass, some
small contract pricing impacts may be felt however past survey data has suggested that the share of participating
employees that are 19 years of age or younger is a relatively small share.
However, the benefits of the lower contract pricing cannot be easily attributed to any given individual because
pass program participants do not pay on a per-boarding basis, and may not pay for their EcoPass at all. For
example, with the CollegePass program, if 30% of a college community was eligible for the Zero Fare for Youth
program, any assessment of equity impacts would need to know whether the College planned to reduce the per
student CollegePass fee by 30% for all participating students (regardless of age) or planned to allow students 19
years of age and under to opt out of the fee, with the remaining students covering the remainder of the contract
amount (which may increase their CollegePass price). Depending on the decision, these can have markedly
different financial outcomes on individual participants, and these decisions fall to the participating colleges, not
to RTD. In the case of business EcoPass, a number of employers fully subsidize the cost of EcoPass and employees
do not pay anything for their use of the transit system; in these cases, any change in EcoPass pricing related to the
introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program would not have any impact on the per-boarding cost to
employees, it would only impact the overall cost to the employer. Further, with little detail on specific
demographics by contract and by age group, assessing per customer demographic impacts is not possible.

15.B.a

For this reason, the average fare analysis assumes that there are no changes in the average fare for the business
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass programs. It is likely that at least some participants in these
programs will benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program over
time however, given that participants in these programs do not pay on a per-boarding basis, that the distribution
of benefits can vary widely across Pass Program participants, and that the demographic makeup of individual Pass
Program contracts is not known, the analysis cannot fairly assess potential changes in the average fare.

5 System Ridership Demographics Overview
The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

African-American/Black
Asian/Pacific Islander
Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin
Hispanic/Latino
Native American/Indian
Other (please specify)

5.2 Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.
Table 1 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 2 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

5.3 Ridership Demographics
Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded
to ethnicity- and income-related questions to develop a breakdown of demographics by fare payment type.
Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 3 presents the fare

6 Fare Change Proposal
As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, the public expressed strong support for a zero
fare for youth pilot. Based on this feedback, staff determined it would be beneficial for the pilot to align with the
2023-24 school year. The proposed fare change is summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
RTD launched a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program for a period of up to 12-months beginning September 1, 2023
and lasting through August 31, 2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, are eligible for
participation in the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot
would likely be supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding
partners. A permanent Zero Fare for Youth program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable,
external funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70%
discount on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program is intended as a pilot, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare
Analysis assumes that the fare pricing for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full
fare before and after the pilot. For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 4 in
Section 6.2.

7 Fare Proposal Outreach
The following is a summary of themes across the feedback received.

7.1 Fare Study Public Outreach Overview
In the fourth and final phase of public engagement, customers and community members had the opportunity to
provide feedback on the recommended changes to the fare structure, policies and programs through public
comment. The public comment period was open from April 13 to May 24, 2023.
Public comment could be submitted in several formats, including:
●
●
●

Online on the Fare Feedback website, which provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed fare
changes
Written on a paper comment form at Fare Study open houses, station pop-ups and community events
Spoken out loud at one of four virtual public hearings

The public comment form asked for open-ended feedback on three topics: the recommended fare structure,
recommended policies and programs and fare equity (Title VI Analysis). Participants could optionally include their
name, organization with which they were affiliated, and demographic information (including racial and ethnic
background, income, household size and age). A list of organizations represented and a summary of demographic
information of the commenters are included in this summary.
Table 5 provides a summary of the outreach events and methods along with the estimated number of participants.

7.2 Zero Fare for Youth Public Outreach Overview
A kickoff media event occurred on August 8, 2023, at the Chestnut Pavilion Denver Union Station with the
following speakers: Debra A. Johnson General Manager and CEO of RTD, Denver Councilwoman Amanda Sawyer,
District 5, Denver Public Schools Board Member Scott Baldermann, District 1, RTD Board Chair Lynn Guissinger,
District O, RTD Board Director Kate Williams, District A.
Staff convened virtual informational meetings with public school districts on August 21, 2023 and August 24, 2023.
These meetings were held with staff representatives from Adams 12, Adams 14, Adams County, Aurora, Boulder
Valley, Brighton, Cherry Creek, Denver, Douglas County, Englewood, Jeffco, Littleton, Mapleton, St. Vrain Valley,
Westminster. The meetings served as an opportunity to provide an overview of the pilot program, seek
administrative support for program evaluation, respond to questions and garner feedback.
RTD implemented a comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy that featured distinctive creative assets to
inform and engage both existing customers and the wider public about the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. The
multi-faceted approach combined digital and social media, a dedicated webpage 5, in-system assets, public
relations efforts, community engagement, partnerships, and paid media, to effectively communicate the benefits
of public transit while encouraging a positive shift in riding habits in the short and long term. To garner direct
feedback from youth and families, RTD administered surveys, virtually and in-person, between October 16, 2023
and March 15, 2024. The survey consisted of questions about youth and/or family travel behaviors and
experiences using RTD services, thoughts on the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program and general information. The
online survey was available in English and Spanish and offered the chance to win a $25 King Soopers gift card for
up to 20 participants. Appendix A provides the full Zero Fare for Youth Survey Analysis Report.
Staff phoned and emailed 105 private schools, 124 youth-serving organizations, 39 recreation centers and 40
libraries to promote the pilot program, distribute English and Spanish toolkits and disseminate surveys to families
who may be using RTD services during the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. Outreach to these entities were
carried out in two phases. The first occurred between October-November 2023 and second occurred between
January-June 2024.
Table 6 provides a summary of the outreach events and methods along with the estimated number of participants.

7.3 Summary of Public Comments
Significant support was provided for the continuation of the Zero Fare for Youth program. Commentors expressed
overwhelming enthusiasm noting the program would:
●
●
●
●
●

Supports youth in accessing school and work
Benefits families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who see
driving as a more affordable option
Meets climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provides youth with independence and agency
Encourages lifelong transit use

7.4 Changes to Proposal
Overall, public comments demonstrate immense support for the proposed fare change. Additionally, no items of
significant concern were raised in public comments that suggest further review of the recommendation and its
impacts on the community is necessary. As such, no changes were proposed to the ZFY program continuation
recommendation, and the final Title VI fare equity analysis will be presented on July 23, 2024 to the RTD Board of
Directors for review and adoption.

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis provides a robust overview of the proposed fare changes. The Average Fare Analysis
analyzes the proposed fare changes described in Section 6, namely the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth
program.
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes are targeted specifically to Youth customers, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all
customers and minority customers and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5%
policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income
customers to a greater degree than all customers. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.

The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, and
notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers benefit to a greater extent than the overall population in the
Average Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by rider
category. The share of Youth customers that are minority and low-income are higher than the other rider
categories. It is important to recognize that a key assumption in the analysis is that Youth customer demographics
align with the demographics of Local, Full Fare customers, as outlined in Section 4.1.2. The methodology of the
2019 CSS specifically avoided targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this customer group is
underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the survey. This leaves open the
possibility that the demographics of Youth customers are different than what was assumed in the analysis, which
would change the results of the Average Fare Analysis. Without any comprehensive survey data on the
demographics of RTD Youth customers, the assumption is used for the Average Fare Analysis.
Appendix B provides the detailed tables that show the average fare for each rider category and fare payment type
under the current and proposed fare structure. A summary overview of the findings resulting from the change,
including the Average Fare per Boarding, Absolute Change and Percentage Change are presented in Table 7 with
the following description:
●

Changes that represent a greater percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., more beneficial
for minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in green.

●

Changes that represent a lesser percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., less beneficial for
minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in yellow.

●

Changes that are outside the Disparate Impact/Disproportionate Burden threshold (+5%) are highlighted
in light / deep red.

8.1.1 Key Findings
The key findings are reflected below:
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.01 per boarding for all customers, $0.92 for minority customers (9% lower than for all customers)
and $0.80 for low-income customers (21% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare per
boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population.

●

No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their average fare with the proposed changes.

●

As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the analysis assumes no change in the average fare paid by participants in
the three EcoPass programs (business EcoPass, neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass). It is likely that
participants in these programs will eventually benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction
of the Zero Fare for Youth program, but given that (1) students in these programs do not pay on a perboarding basis, (2) organizations have some discretion as to how to apply contract pricing reductions, and
(3) with little detail on specific demographics by contract and by age group, the analysis cannot fairly
assess potential changes in the average fare. By assuming no change in the average fare for the Pass
Programs, the analysis is likely conservative and understates the fare reduction benefits of the Zero Fare
for Youth program.

8.1.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 8 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $0.97 to $0.92, a 5.2% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is 1%, indicating that
minority customers are expected to benefit somewhat more than all customers as a result of the proposed fare
changes. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare
changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

Table 9 presents the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for low-income customers to the overall
customer population. For low-income customers, the average fare decreases from $0.84 to $0.80, a 5.1%
decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage
point difference between the percentage change for low-income customers and all customers is less than 1%,

indicating that low-income customers are expected to benefit more than all customers as a result of the proposed
fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s Disproportionate Burden threshold, the
fare changes do not represent a Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers as the percentage point
difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%

9 Cumulative Findings and Mitigations
Zero Fare for Youth aims to enhance the lives of RTD customers and communities by reducing transportation costs
for families. By inviting youth ages 19 and under to ride the bus and train at no cost, the program seeks to remove
barriers to education and employment, while creating access to destinations across the metro Denver region.
The proposed fare change for a permanent no cost fare for youth ages 19 and under do not appear to create any
Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear to create any Disproportionate Burdens on lowincome communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the implementation of the
proposed fare change.

10 Next Steps
It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
change upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
[This section will be completed once RTD’s Board of Directors has been made aware and considered this equity
analysis.]

Section I: Survey Methodology
The development of the Zero Fare for Youth survey effort began in Summer 2023. Originally, this effort
was to include a pre, mid, and post-test survey of a randomly selected group of students and their
families. To achieve this and considering it would be inappropriate for RTD to have access to school
contact lists, RTD sought out partnerships with numerous local school districts that would facilitate and
administer the survey’s distribution to the selected families. A representative sampling plan (by
enrollment) was developed by RTD and each district was provided with a random number sequence as
well as detailed instructions on how to apply these number sequences to their contact lists to select
the participating families. Unfortunately, engagement with all but one of the district representatives
seemingly ceased upon distribution of the random selection number sequences.
In an attempt to continue the collection of feedback and experiences of youth taking advantage of the
Zero Fare for Youth pilot, RTD decided to distribute this survey instrument to numerous youth-serving
organizations, recreation centers and libraries across RTD’s service area. At this point, the survey
ceased to be randomly selected, and became a self-selection study.
It should be noted that while the data collected in this effort is still valid feedback directly from RTD
customers and youths participating in Zero Fare for Youth pilot, and while general reporting and
comparative analysis can be and was performed on this data, predictive statistical analysis could not
be performed as this study did not contain a random sample of participants.
The survey itself consists of 31 questions and gathered feedback and information on: rider experience,
individual and household transit habits, and personal as well as household demographics. A total of
232 surveys were completed and the reporting and analysis of the survey responses are provided in
the next section.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Zero Fares on National Vote Early Day and Election Day
2024

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to implement
zero fares on October 29, 2024 (National Vote Early Day) and November 5, 2024 (General Election Day)
and to further authorize the biennial implementation of zero-fare days for each National Vote Early Day
and General Election Day thereafter.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In July 2022, the Board approved the offering of zero-fare transit for National Vote Early Day (October
28, 2022) and General Election Day (November 8, 2022).
Data from the Survey of the Performance of American Elections from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab demonstrated that, in 2016, approximately 30 percent of
non-voters across the country claimed that the lack of transportation to the polls was a factor in
deciding not to vote. Among persons of color under the age of 30 responding to the survey, 38 percent
cited lack of transportation as a reason for not voting.
While research shows that Colorado’s system of all-mail ballot voting significantly increases voter
turnout both overall and for all major demographic groups, providing zero-fare transit during general
elections would further reduce barriers to polling place access, particularly among traditionally
disadvantaged voter groups. The Board of Directors’ adoption of a policy to provide system-wide zerofare transit on general election days would demonstrate the agency’s commitment to the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this Recommended Action, the Board continues the practice of authorizing zero-fare transit
for National Vote Early Day and General Election Day, both for 2024 and for future years.

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution No. ____, Series of 2024, authorizing the
refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2010B.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt
service payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the essential assets of the District. Bonds and COPs are referred
to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either or tax-exempt or taxable. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2023, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.661 billion.

15.D

During the June 11, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff presented a discussion item
regarding a potential refunding of $100 million of RTD’s $400 million Build America Bonds (BABs) debt
portfolio. This portion of the BABs is held as obligations in the form of COPs. Refunding these COPs will
mitigate the financial risk exposure presented by the reduction in the federal interest rate subsidy which
reduces the net in interest cost to RTD. Since 2013, the federal government has paid a lower interest
rate subsidy than originally contemplated by RTD in issuing the BABs. Moreover, further future interest
rate subsidy reductions or possibly even elimination are subject to the federal budget sequestration
process.
Currently, only the $100 million of the $400 million BAB debt portfolio is attractive from a refunding
perspective; however, the additional $300 million will continue to be monitored for refunding
opportunities should market conditions warrant such action.
DISCUSSION
RTD and its municipal advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created opportunities
to take advantage of low interest rates.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2024 to refund the
currently outstanding COPs, Series 2010B, which are BABs. The related contractual documents required
to effectuate the refundings are identified in the Resolution and include:
•
•
•
•
•

The Preliminary Official Statement
The Lease
The Trust Indenture
The Continuing Disclosure Agreement
The Certificate Purchase Agreement

Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD

Resolution No. __ delegates to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer or to the Chief Financial
Officer the authority (effective for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the Series
2024A refunding certificates of participation, provided that:
(a)
the aggregate principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant
to the Lease, as amended by the Third Amendment to Lease, shall not exceed $175,000,000;
(b)
the maximum annual amount of Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant to
the Lease, as amended by the Third Amendment to Lease, in any Fiscal Year shall not exceed
$21,500,000;

Packet Pg. 259

15.D

(c)
the Lease Term shall not extend beyond December 31, 2040, or the average useful
life of the Leased Property related to the Lease, whichever is shorter;
(d)
the maximum net effective interest rate on the interest component of the Base
Rentals relating to the 2024 Certificates shall not exceed 5.25%; and
(e)
the 2024 Refunding Project shall (i) not be required to result in net present value
savings at any percentage of the principal amount of the 2010B Certificates being refunded,
provided that the 2024 Refunding Project shall not result in a net present value loss as a
percentage of the principal amount of the 2010B Certificates being refunded worse than -4%,
and (ii) result in the District realizing a savings greater than zero measured on a gross basis,
without taking into account the present value or net present value of such savings.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Two benefits of this recommended COPs refunding transaction that will contribute to the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success:
1. Eliminate the risk that the BAB subsidy is further reduced or eliminated in the future; this risk has
a potential cost of up to $2.685 million per year through 2040 in relation to these COPs
2. Use existing COPs Series 2010B debt service reserve fund to reduce outstanding debt by
approximately $10 million

year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory
provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year
beyond the then current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment
with respect to the 2024 Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals
and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District
in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2024 Certificates shall
constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond
the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness
or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or
indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
2024 Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of
governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the
meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the
2024 Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond
those budgeted and appropriated for the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, as amended by the Third Amendment to
Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair
rental value of the 2010 Leased Property and do not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place
the District under an economic compulsion to renew the Lease or to exercise its option to
purchase the 2010 Leased Property pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the period during which the District has an option to purchase the 2010 Leased
Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the 2010
Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee for Refunded 2010B
Certificates. In the event that the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to
proceed with the 2024 Refunding Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the
provisions set forth herein, the Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on
the behalf and in the name of the District its option to redeem all or a portion of the 2010B
Certificates as set forth in the Sale Certificate (the "Refunded 2010B Certificates"), on the date
or dates and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate. Prior to the execution of
the Sale Certificate, the District hereby irrevocably instructs UMB Bank, n.a., as trustee for the
2010B Certificates, to give conditional notice of refunding and redemption to the Owners of the
Refunded 2010B Certificates in accordance with the provisions of the Sale Certificate and the
2010 Indenture. In accordance with the provisions of the 2010 Indenture, the District further
instructs the Trustee to recalculate the schedule of Base Rentals set forth in Exhibit B to the
Lease to reflect the principal amount and debt service requirements of the Certificates
outstanding after implementing the 2024 Refunding Project.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2024 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or

otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2024 Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 11.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2010 Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2010 Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.
Section 13.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall be in full force and effect
immediately upon its passage and adoption.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Ticket Vending Machine Replacement Appropriation

July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to appropriate $6,000,000 from the Unrestricted Fund for replacement of
Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs), which will be replenished with FTA Section 5339 grant funding.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD utilizes TVMs as one of many methods available to customers to purchase fares. TVMs are
primarily located on or near rail platforms; however, some TVMs are also available for use at bus
facilities along Flatiron Flyer routes. TVMs allow customers to purchase fare media in the form of paper
tickets using cash, credit or debit cards. Approximately $13 million (21%) of 2024 budgeted fare
revenue of $64 million is expected to be purchased with cash and the remainder purchased primarily
through electronic means.
Similar to bus fareboxes, TVMs provide customers with a viable alternative to electronic payments by
offering cash purchases for convenience as well as access for those who are unbanked. Offering
alternative payment options reduces barriers, particularly among traditionally disadvantaged groups.
Providing convenient, accessible payment options demonstrates the agency’s commitment to the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Due to the expansion of rail and Flatiron Flyer bus services with respect to the FasTracks program, RTD
currently deploys different TVM models, though all were manufactured by the same vendor. The use of
different models requires staff to utilize two different operating systems to support the TVMs.
RTD has 181 TVMs that are serviced and maintained by RTD’s Treasury Division within the Finance
Department. TVMs have a useful life expectancy of eight to 10 years. RTD’s total average age of TVMs
is 11.5 years, meaning that the majority of TVMs have exceeded their useful service life, resulting in a
shortage of spare parts and aging technology
A table depicting the age and location of TVMs throughout the rail network follows:

RTD initially began planning for TVM replacements in 2021, with a budget appropriation of
$12,000,000. This $12,000,000 has been included in the capital carryforward for each fiscal year as
RTD pursued additional analyses of the necessary number of replacement TVMs needed, while taking
into consideration equity impacts of reducing or moving TVM equipment. The estimated replacement
cost of $12,000,000, or approximately $50,000 per unit, was developed from current TVM equipment
replacement costs with RTD’s current vendor.
Staff recently completed an updated evaluation of replacement costs taking into consideration updated
specifications to ensure Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, compatibility with the ABT system,
improvements to equipment component resiliency and to allow for scalability for possible future
modifications such as ABT card reloads, contactless payments and fare media modifications.
This recent revaluation also factored in inflation and the current cost of TVM replacements, which is
now estimated to be approximately $18,000,000. This cost includes removal and installation costs,
additional parts, and a $1,000,000 project contingency.
As the Board has already appropriated $12,000,000 of the estimated $18,000,000 replacement cost,
this Recommended Action seeks appropriation of the additional $6,000,000 expenditure from the
Unrestricted Fund, which will be reimbursed with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Section 5339
grant funding.
FTA Section 5339 grants are discretionary apportionments for capital projects to replace, rehabilitate,
and purchase buses, vans and related equipment. Section 5339 apportionments are available to RTD,
and, pursuant to conversations with FTA representatives, TVM replacements qualify for this funding.
Upon the Board’s approval of this Recommended Action, staff anticipates an approximate 18-month
procurement and replacement process beginning in August 2024. This timeline aligns with statements
made to the state of Colorado and to Wells Fargo regarding RTD’s intent to achieve PCI compliance by
the end of 2025.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The gross additional appropriation is $6,000,000, which amount will be offset with reimbursement from
Section 5339 grant funding resulting in no net additional cost to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2024 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the September
2024 service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 38 service changes proposed for September 2024 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail operators
to select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall
operations plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD
System Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, there is no disparate impact on minority populations, nor a
disproportionate burden on low-income populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a

Packet Pg. 287

15.F

disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September 2024 service
change proposal includes one major service change out of 38 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required
to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report
is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy
A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in the service hours of
any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be
subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate
impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 32 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming September 2024 service
change. Of these 38 changes, one service has proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater
than that of baseline service and thus meets established thresholds for a major service change. That
route is shown in bold in the following table.

Methodology

Packet Pg. 288

15.F

Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line level, route/line
block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings:
• A potential disparate impact was identified at the individual route level: the one route/line that
had major service changes, Route 40, had a potential disparate impact finding.
•

The proposed major service change was examined, at the network level, to determine overall
impacts to equity (i.e., minority and low-income) populations compared to non-equity (i.e., nonminority and non-low-income) populations. However, the systemwide service increase findings
mirror the route analysis for Route 40 due to being the sole major service change.

At the network level, service changes (service increases solely on Route 40), minority populations stand
to benefit less than non-minority populations (1.37% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This difference falls
below the disparate impact threshold of 1.56%. Therefore, the proposed major service increase results
in a system-level disparate impact. However, low-income populations stand to benefit slightly less than
non-low-income populations (1.57% vs. 1.62%, respectively). The difference does not fall below the
10% disproportionate burden threshold of 1.46%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service increase.
Conclusions
Although the major service change has resulted in a potential disparate impact at both the route and
network levels, RTD recommends keeping the September 2024 major service change plan as proposed,
as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Route 40). The
substantial legitimate justification for the Route 40 service improvement follows RTD Board approval of
the SOP, which recommends frequent service levels along the entire Route 40 corridor between 40th•
Colorado Station and Southmoor Station. Moreover, the improvement also ensures there is a Collective
Bargaining Agreement-compliant restroom at each terminal. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate
justification for the service improvement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits to customers of the proposed overall service plan are
significant, with a large benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of five of the
six minor changes (of the 38 service changes, only those routes with non-cost-neutral impacts to hours),
are considered low-income-serving bus routes, and a total of two out of six are considered minorityserving bus routes. Other minor changes include improvements to on-time performance for 15 bus
routes, reinstatement of fall/winter tripper service on eight routes, three individual implementations of
the SOP, and four changes related to finalization of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the September 2024 runboards
to ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 38 bus route/patterns of RTD’s forthcoming September 2024 runboard. Of this
change, one service met the established threshold for a major service change. The route tabulated below has
proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service and are proposed for the longterm (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).
Service Adjustments (1 service)

Route 40: Improve headways to 15 minutes weekday
mornings through evenings along the entire route.

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed September 2024 service changes include only the
improvement of service levels of Route 40. This route serves populations in east Denver that are below the
district average of minority populations and just under the district average for low-income populations.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of the major service increase
and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a slightly lower increase in service
(i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received
0.02% less of a benefit than non-low-income areas. However, this difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold. Minority areas received less of an increase in service (i.e., were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.15% less than non-minority areas,
a difference falling below the 10% disparate impact threshold. Thus, a potential disparate impact was identified
at the route level for the changes proposed for Route 40. The systemwide service increases findings mirror the
route analysis for Route 40 due to the Route 40 being the sole major service change.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•

•
•

•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (the “Family of Services”) depending on service type, route
alignment and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major
service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.

2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2024 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service
changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in
changes made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route or rail line. These
proportional differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and
route/line proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status
is based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Six public meetings were conducted between June 18-26, 2024. No comments regarding the major service
change were collected during these meetings. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, and number of
attendees.
The Communications and Engagement department produced a recorded webinar and downloadable toolkits,
which were provided to community-based organizations. Efforts were made to increase the use of social media
platforms, and in-system promotional assets were used to inform the public about the service changes. RTD’s
newly formed Impact Team was deployed to inform and gather feedback at stops and stations.
The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com, by phone at
303-299-6000 and by fax at 303-299-2227.

In addition to the public meetings, the Transit Equity Office contacted 67 key public activity centers within a
quarter mile of Route 40. These entities were informed of the proposed major service change, provided with
instructions on how to offer feedback, and encouraged to attend the open houses.
The Transit Equity Office collaborated with three community-based organizations (CBO) to share information
and collect feedback virtually and in-person. Of note, one CBO attended a community event and conducted
direct outreach along the Route 40 corridor. A total of 39 customers responded to the survey administered by
the CBO. Four additional survey responses were collected via the Service Changes website bringing the total
survey responses for the Route 40 to 43. Of these 43 responses, 41.5% stated that the change has no impact
on them, 14.6% indicated it has a somewhat positive impact, and 41.5% stated it is a very positive change.
Table 2 captures the common themes of the feedback received and the total responses.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analyses

Proposed service changes for the September 2024 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in
service were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
(current) network using 2018-2022 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the route/line individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of disparate impact (for minority populations) or disproportionate burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

For the September 2024 runboard, 32 bus routes and six rail lines will undergo various service changes. Of
these, 6 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 115 total weekday revenue service
hours and 51 additional weekend service hours. While temporary and technically not meeting major
service change requirements, with the ending of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project the discontinuation
of temporary service on the Free MetroRide with reinvestment of its resources into improving Free MallRide
service levels is a combined cost neutral change. The improvement of service on the Free MallRide allows for
service every 5 minutes between Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station along an updated alignment
along 15th and 17th Streets. The L Line is also proposed to resume operations downtown in September.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions

There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed September 2024 runboard.

Major Service Change Increases

One bus route, the Route 40, had a proposed major service increase which includes service increases of 25%
or greater. Improved headways are proposed on Route 40 for the September 2024 runboard as outlined in
the RTD Board approval of the Systemwide Optimization Plan (SOP).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential disparate impacts (DI) and/or
disproportionate burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service increases,
the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and lowincome populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects of the
reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route 40

Proposal: As outlined in the RTD Board-approved System Optimization Plan (SOP), it is proposed to
implement 15-minute headways weekdays, mornings through evenings, along the full corridor. This also
ensures there is a Collective Bargaining Agreement compliant restroom at each terminal.
As shown in Table 4, a slightly lower percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit
from the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.99% vs. 1.01%,
respectively). However, this difference falls below the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.91%).
Therefore, no potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. However, a lower percentage of the

district’s minority population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the nonminority population (0.91% vs. 1.06%, respectively). This difference falls below the 10% disparate
impact threshold (0.95%). Thus, there is a potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring
further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement and network
level analysis).

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).

The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 115 weekday revenue hours
Of the over 31,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, equity
populations represented an average share of population compared to district averages. Of this total,
nearly 4,300 low-income people and nearly 10,500 minorities would receive service improvements.
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The one bus route with major service increases serves slightly below-average lowincome and minority populations and is not classified as an equity route.

In review of the proposed Route 40 changes at the systemwide level, there is a potential disparate
impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2024 to September 2024 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at
or above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas on-low-income
and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and minority
population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2018-2022
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3
The thresholds summarized in Table 4 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

Based on existence of the route within the May 2024 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops or
rail stations. 2018-2022 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 6 summarizes the change in service for total block group populations underlying
the bus stops with proposed major service increases proportionally compared to population in the District. There
are no proposed service decreases. The comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be
impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. For
the proposed runboard, systemwide service increases mirror the route analysis for Route 40 due to the Route
40 being the sole major service change.
No major service changes (longer than 12 months) were proposed for rail services with the September 2024
runboard.

For system-level service changes (service increases solely on Route 40), minority populations stand to
benefit less than non-minority populations (1.37% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This difference falls below
the disparate impact threshold of 1.56%. Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the
proposed major service increase. Low-income populations stand to benefit slightly less than non-lowincome populations (1.57% vs. 1.62%, respectively). The difference does not fall below the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 1.46%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is found with
the proposed major service increase.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed between May 2024 and September 2024 include schedule
adjustments, suspension of school trips, changes to fall/winter schedules and trip availability and additional
service. The sole major service change proposed for this runboard was for service increases on Route 40.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

Of the 38 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, one had a potential finding
Route 40 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.15% less
benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations benefited 0.02% less than non-lowincome populations but the difference did not meet the disproportionate burden threshold

Systemwide-level Findings:

Route 40 comprises the September 2024 runboard’s only major service change
Almost 31,000 people live near Route 40 bus stops. Both minority and low-income populations are
represented at slightly lower shares of the population than district averages (34% and 14%,
respectively). Low-income populations received a slightly lower benefit (were less positively
impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas benefited 0.02% less
compared to non-low-income areas. However, this difference did not fall below the disproportionate
burden threshold. Minority populations received a lower benefit (were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefited 0.15% less compared
to non-minority areas. This difference fell below the disparate impact threshold; therefore, a systemlevel disparate impact was found with the proposed change
When considering the proposed service increase on Route 40 for the nearly 50,000 people within the
block groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the district overall, minority
populations stand to benefit less compared to non-minority populations. Minority population
areas received 0.37% less of a benefit compared to non-minority areas. The difference was below the
disparate impact threshold by 0.19%; therefore, a potential systemwide disparate impact was
found. Low-income populations received 0.05% less of a benefit than non-low-income
populations. The difference was 0.11% above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden;
therefore, no potential disproportionate burden was found with the proposed service decrease

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals
Alterations to the initially proposed September 2024 service changes4 include an improvement in service levels
along Route 40 which serves low-income populations at a below average rate than as the District average.
RTD recommends keeping the September 2024 service plan as proposed as there are no practical alternatives
to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Route 40). The substantial legitimate justification for the
Route 40 service improvement follows RTD Board approval of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) which
recommends frequent service levels along the entire Route 40 corridor between 40th and Colorado Station and
Southmoor Station. Moreover, the improvement also ensures there is a Collective Bargaining Agreement
compliant restroom at each terminal. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the service
improvement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits to customers of the proposed overall service plan are significant with
a large benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of 5 of the 6 minor changes (of the
38 service changes, just those routes with non-cost-neutral impacts to hours) are considered low-income-serving
bus routes and a total of 2 out of 6 are considered minority-serving bus routes. Other minor changes include
improvements to on-time performance for 15 bus routes, reinstatement of fall/winter tripper service on 8 routes,
3 individual implementations of the SOP, and 4 changes related to finalization of the Downtown Rail Replacement
Project.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2024 Service Change

July 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the September 2024 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU), the September
2024 service change process facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new
work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
Many service changes recommended for September 2024 restore rail service levels and patterns to the
Central and Southeast corridors, with the Coping Panel Project and Phase One of the Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project anticipated to be completed. Changes to bus service to maintain access to the
Central Business District are also contained herein.
DISCUSSION
These recommendations include a mix of service improvements, reductions, and adjustments aimed at
addressing system network reliability, increasing seasonal school-related capacity, and restoring service
to the Central and Southeast Corridors with the conclusion of current rail reconstruction efforts.
Notable changes include the restoration of service levels on the E and H lines upon the Coping Panel
Project’s completion and the discontinuation of suspensions and detours on the Central Corridor. Rail
services on the D and H Lines will resume the regular pattern on the Central Corridor’s Downtown Loop.
L Line service, which was suspended with Phase One of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project, will
be restored. Additionally, bus service on the Free MetroRide will be discontinued as five-minute service
frequency returns on the Free Mall Ride. Finally, the removal of bus detours downtown and the
restoration of Central Corridor rail services, enable Route 0 Limited midday service to be discontinued.

Packet Pg. 332

16.G

The September 2024 Service Changes are directed at improving on-time performance, maintaining CBA
compliance with, and adjusting service levels to match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services, and the ability to
• enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
• national origin; also there is no disparate impact on a minority population nor a disproportionate
• burden on a low-income population
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

A summary of the service proposals, provided below, are detailed in Attachment A.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between May 15 and June 28, 2024, staff reached out to the community via public meetings, civic and
non-profit organizations and direct contact efforts at bus stops and rail stations. Additionally, an updated
feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or line. Written
communications, survey data and public comments collected during this public comment period have
been summarized and listed in Attachment C of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron/Orchard Parkway: schedule adjustments aimed at improving on-time
performance on weekdays.
Longmont Routes (323, 324, 326, 327, BOLT, LD)/ 8th and Coffman Park-n-Ride (PnR) Closure
Due to reconstruction of Coffman Street, between 1st Ave and 9th Ave, related to CO 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) corridor construction, the current Park-n-Ride at 8th and Coffman is closed, and service for
routes BOLT, LD, 323, 324, 326 and 327 have been relocated to Bross Street and 8th Avenue as of
Sunday, May 26, 2024.
Light Rail Maintenance
Due to ongoing preventative maintenance inspections of the rail network along both the Southeast and
Southwest Corridors, and corresponding protocols involving reduced operating speeds, schedule
adjustments are recommended for the D, E, H, and R lines. Additionally, the increased service levels

Packet Pg. 333

16.G

planned for the E and H lines are recommended to be set at 30 minutes, rather than 15 minutes on each
line, to better match available workforce resources to support schedule adherence.

Please do a survey to learn how many more people commute between LoDo and Littleton
(former C line) versus central downtown Denver and Littleton (D line). The C Line was
wellused before the pandemic and it could be again.
I work next to union station. When the D line loops at California and Stout I have to walk up
to catch the train. Which adds 20 plus minutes to my commute. If I try to catch the E at
Union Station and it is delayed or doesn’t run that means I am behind catching a D at
Broadway. If the D is also delayed or doesn’t run my commute can extend to 2 hours. RTD is
unreliable. Please reinstate the C line.
Please bring back the train from mineral to union station. Being able to ride it during the
detour is convenient. Having to transfer to the E line is terrible because the E line is constantly
behind schedule or running with reduced service.
Many families here in Littleton were negatively impacted when the C line was discontinued.
The straight shot from Mineral to Union Station without a 20 minute wait in between was of
ideal. The most recent D line detour was reminiscent of those times so we have used RTD as
it’s much easier than driving. It’s unfortunate that there won’t be a straight shot without a
layover after the update. It will definitely defer us from using RTD.

E Line:
• I am in favor of restoring 15-minute frequency to E line. Please implement this change.
• It is great that frequencies are being restored on this line, but this should not be classified as a
service improvement but rather a service restoration. 15 minute frequencies are also the bare
minimum for rapid transit, and service should be further increased to 10 minutes or more, in
accordance with the SOP.
• The train leaves every hour now and it’s terrible. Please restore e line to 15 mins , at least 30
mins minimum during construction /maintenance
• Return of 15 minute frequencies is very desirable.
• I would rather you change to every 30 minutes if you don't have the staff to cover trains every
15 minutes. To me I would rather see consistency and less trains than cancelations due to
capacity of train operators.
• Please do this it would make my life and every other regular commuter on the E lines life so
much easier
• Is there a plan in place to ensure enough operators are hired, trained, and available to actually
meet the 15-minute scheduled frequency? Prior to the disruptive rail maintenance, this was an
ongoing issue that caused actual service to be between 15 and 45 minute frequencies due to
operator shortages. Additionally, if the coping panel repairs are completed early, will service
restoration also be moved up ahead of the 9/15 date?
• Reduce airport fare. $10 to get to the airport is expensive. More than Chicago or Seattle. And
both of those cities have much more extensive and useful rail systems out of their airports.
• Almost every time I've ridden the E line I've had trains not show up when they're supposed to.
• I would stopped using when service went to hourly and will look to go back to commuting 3-4
days a week…if you can find a way for times/drivers are more reliable and consistent. More
then a few times I would show up and train was cancelled or I would sit on train at a full stop
for 10+ minutes. I use to get to work in lone tree but can not use if not reliable.

If this actually happens, it will be better. Rtd isn't known for its reliability, however, so I won't
be even remotely surprised should this not happen. Rtd can promise the trains will run more
frequently, but will inevitably cancel dozens of runs a day.
Makes using the light rail worth it again for my household

H Line:
• I drive to Southmoor to get the rail because the Illiff station is full of drug users and homeless
and I’m afraid to be there. Also no parking.
• I have completely stopped using Rtd this summer and have switched to driving every time I go
downtown. Routing H train to downtown again will be wonderful, but will make us all even
angrier than we already are right now if you don't also fix all the 10mph delays with unreliable
schedules. Don't create a train schedule based on hypothetical 55mph speeds. Create the new
train schedule using actual 10mph speeds of this issue won't be fixed by September.
• Increasing the frequency again will be a relief! I've had to make a lot of alternate
arrangements for my commute and am looking forward to the Fall.
• I am really looking forward to the restoration of service and route adjustment.
R Line:
• Please keep R line service at 4am. Just one northbound train from Lincoln Station will make a
big difference.
• Ideally, connections from R Line to A Line both airport bound and Ridgegate bound will be
improved. Currently, airport bound is pretty good, although on the tight side (connections can
be missed). Ridgegate bound is on the longer side.
• I strongly urge you to consider increasing the R line frequency to 15 minutes and extending
service to Ridgegate Parkway. As more development has been established within Aurora city
limits, there has been a steady increase in ridership. However, all riders are facing trip
cancelations leading to 60+ minutes of additional wait times for the next train. I understand
that you are facing an operator shortage and allocating resources is vital for you, but from a
rider's perspective, having to wait 15 minutes for the next train after a cancelled trip feels less
of an inconvenience than having to wait at least a half hour for the next train. Also a one seat
ride from Aurora to say Sky Ridge makes lives a lot better through connections.

W Line:
• Thank you, thank you, thank you!
• This increase in service on the W Line will better support my schedule and provide me with
more travel options to JeffCo. I fully support it. Thank you.
• The W line is my first and last transit to and from my house. I work at the airport and also ride
the A line. When it's time to head home I am in the time frame when the A line has decreased
the schedule. By the time I arrive at the W line I am waiting for 30 minutes +, before the next
train comes in. Having the train run every 15 minutes would help cut my commute time
greatly. I stand behind the changes.

The W has had seen so much neglect since covid. It's nice to see that some attention is being
put on riders. Now if you can get more police on the system and check fares, that would be
great.
Absolutely change it to every 15minutes for a train. Currently, if a train is cancelled, a person
has to wait a full hour for the next one? Weekends, too!!
As I sometimes drive to the Oak station to get better head times, this change may induce me
to go to the Jeffco Center instead, and thereby cut GHG.
When the W line switched to every 30 minutes, we stopped using it because the wait
were too variable and long.
I will use it more frequently to travel to downtown from Golden with increased frequency.
I would be very grateful for this change! I ride the W from Jeff Co Government Station to get
to work, and the 15-minute frequency would make the commute much more convenient and
less stressful - and potentially encourage others to make more use of the service (especially
now that the City of Golden has a transit service to take you from town to the W line).
Public transportation works best if it is convenient and this change gives more convenience to
jump on the W Line.
While the change does not personally impact me, it very strongly impacts people around me.
Please restore 15-minute service, and while you’re at it, extend the G line to Goosetown
Station in Golden. Doing so would improve public transit in Golden tremendously. Thank you!
I believe the level of service should be decided by level of use and demonstrated community
needs, not idealistic visions of utopia.
If the train comes more often, it’s easier to use
When visitors come, particularly during the winter, it can be a challenge to drive to DIA for
pickups due to traffic or inclement weather. The light rail is a big help, but not if you are
waiting around in the rain, wind or cold for the next train.
I think it's important to have 15-minute frequency on the W-Line from Golden.
Please restore the 15 minute service to Golden.
It would be very helpful to me to have more frequency on the W line--especially when I am
connecting to the Airport Line. Thank You
W line provides transport for Golden students going to Lakewood High and Golden residents
commuting to downtown Denver. Adding the additional frequency allows Golden residents to
catch the W line using the Ore Cart or biking to the station, rather than having to drive or
catch a ride to the Federal Center
Reducing the frequency of service would negatively affect me and ny willingness o use the rail
line.
the next evolution in W-line service is an express from either Oak St Station or the Federal
Center. I can currently ride my bike faster to downtown than the train.
Would love more regular trains for commuting!
Increased frequency equals increased use.
I currently never consider talked the light rail due to infrequent service. Additional service
would make it an option for me and would all more access to the city for those without
vehicles.

Route 0/0B:
• I am optimistic, but concerned about this service change, specifically the truncation of route 0
and the introduction of 0B. It is a good idea to separate the line into two separate buses, as
often the 0 is 10 or 15 minutes delayed by the time it gets to Littleton. Additionally, the new
routing through Highlands Ranch is better than the previous. What is critical to the success of
a new route 0B is maintaining or improving upon a 30 minute headway and timing connections
well at Englewood station with both route 0 and the D line. If service is reduced on 0B to only
every 60 minutes, it will effectively kill what is one of the best transportation options for those
in Englewood, Littleton, and Highlands Ranch. But if headways stay at 30 minutes, or
preferentially become every 20 or 15 minutes, then the 0B will be worthwhile. Additionally, to

make it the best route possible, its northbound termination at Englewood should coincide with
the departures of route 0 and the D line and the transfer with route 66 should be optimized.
I support this adjustment to the route. It allows me to take the bus to my job.
I would expect this and other route splitting to cost RTD ridership. As I understand it, people
going from downtown to south of Englewood will now have to transfer, which takes time and
requires standing in the weather. Personally, if I can't get somewhere without a transfer, I
usually drive.
I would only support this if the frequency of the proposed 0B route was maintained at 15
minute intervals. Reducing service to every 30 minutes would only harm communities and
businesses in South Denver and Englewood. As you'll recall, a similar service reduction has
already impacted the southern branch of the 12 route, which runs only every 30 minutes. The
existing 0 route, which still runs every 15 minutes, is the only alternative option residents in
Englewood and South Denver have remaining.

Route 11:
• Increased frequencies are great, but I do not use this route to get to school, and frequencies
remain low on off-peak and weekend periods, especially later at night.
Route 24:
• I think this route should be on a 30 minute interval as it would be better for light rail
connections as well as serving DU students and those wanting to take the bus to Cherry Creek
North, Botanical Gardens, City Park, Southglenn, etc. Also I would be in favor of a route 25 or
25L that runs along South University between Englewood Station and C-470 University, or
wherever it could connect with a 402L, to provide more transportation to parts of Centennial
and Highlands Ranch from Englewood without having to wait on route 66 from Broadway and
Littleton.

Increased frequencies are amazing! More evening and weekend service would be helpful
though.
"Mornings through evenings" is vague, so I would like to submit my plea that it run more
frequently from at least 7 am to 8 pm, please. I work as a public librarian, so we do not work
standard 9-5 hours in order to serve the public. I would also love a Limited for the 40! This
route currently takes 3 times longer by bus than it would to drive--the increased frequency will
be massively helpful for reducing my wait time between connections; a Limited service would
be incredible. Thank you for considering!
great you are looking into better public transportation
I am glad that the 40 bus will be coming every 15 minutes on weekdays, however, I also wish
that it was on the weekends too because I would ride the 40 more.

reality that NOONE WILL CHECK THEM ON THEIR BEHAVIOR and we all suffer from poor....
correction - the lack of parental control, corrective action and inability to beat some damn
sense into these little bastard/assholes!
Route 65:
• Increased frequencies are good, but more service on weekends and off-peak times would be
helpful, as they are extremely low on this route.
• So glad RTD is providing school year service from the Central Park Station to the Sandoval
Campus that aligns with Northfield High School bell times! Thank you!
Route 93L:
• As a rider who lives near the 93L, I have spent more time wishing I could be able to use the
route, rather than actually using it. One of the biggest inhibitors is the poor connection to the
N line at Thornton Crossroads/104th Station. I would find myself at best sprinting to/from the
platform to make my connection, or at worst, opting to transfer to the 120X at Thornton
Parkn-ride as I watch the southbound N line pull away from the station, while the bus is
pulling into the driveway. Improving connections to the N line will definitely sway me to using
the 93L more often. On a side note, increasing the service span to 5 am to 10 pm would be
the other factor that would get me on board more often.

Slightly more frequent buses that run a bit later through the night would help make the bus
the best way to get to the airport by far
I would love to be able to take later flights home and still make the bus
More late night service and more-frequent-than-hourly runs on the weekends would be a huge
benefit!! The exact timing of the bus arriving at the airport would be less impactful if there
were more arrival times to choose from.
Add late night AB service back!
I'd like Route AB to extend to Boulder Junction to aid in folks including myself living around
Junction place accessing the route without having to take Uber/Lyft to downtown. Also, the
frequency of AB buses leaving from the airport needs to be increased to more than 1 per hour.
There are often 2-3x as many riders as seats for times where the bus only comes every hour.
The buses are often full to the point where riders who board at flatiron have to stand for 35
minutes at speeds of 75 mph. This doesn’t seem safe. Increasing frequency beyond the two
hours in morning and evening where you run every 30 minutes might be in order - esp during
peak travel seasons. The good news - the bus is VERY popular
The current level of service on the AB1 bus route is simply unacceptable. On a regular basis,
busses are completely full to capacity. People are forced to stand for the hour-long trip, due to
a lack of frequent service from the 3rd largest airport in the US. It is necessary to run more
frequent service on this route.

Please increase frequency of service - hourly service is not sufficient in this high-population
area, and busses are often over capacity. Additionally, the last bus from the airport is
exceptionally early. I have had flight delays which left me stranded at DIA.
The current level of service on the AB1 bus route really doesn't meet the needs in terms of
capacity, frequency, or coverage (particularly later in the day). On a regular basis, buses are
over capacity and people are required to stand for the hour-long trip, due to a lack of frequent
service from the 3rd largest airport in the US. Additionally, many flights do not arrive until well
after the last bus has left for the day and alternatives have only gotten more expensive and
less available over the past few years. Having reliable AB service is really important to so
many groups (residents and visitors alike). Please bring back additional service. The need is
greater now than ever and the service is not even where it was a few years back.
More frequent buses would be tremendously helpful. There are times that I wasn’t able to get
on the bus at the airport due to capacity. A bus every 30 minutes would reduce the wait time
and make bus travel to and from Boulder/DIA much more efficient.
Higher bus frequency (every 30 mins) has the side benefit of trivializing many delays.
The experience of riding the AB is horrible due to the low frequency of buses vs the high
demand. Long, disorganized lines form at DIA and people budge, plus the bus fills up so
people have to stand the entire ride or get rejected from boarding. On the way to the airport,
the bus takes forever to load since there are so many people waiting at each stop and the bus
ends up full so people have to stand. Going to and from the airport on the AB1 is the most

going to encourage people to use public transport!
The current level of service on the AB1 bus route is simply unacceptable. The last bus is too
early, the first bus of the day is too late, and it is necessary to run more frequent service on

The current level of service on the AB1 bus route is simply unacceptable. This is an amazing
route in theory but cannot be relied upon given its current infrequency of buses. Increase bus
service to every 30 minutes and I would gladly use the bus more often. But for early flights
when the bus only comes every 1 hour, it is hard to rely on.
We need thirty minute service and a serious increase in service on holiday weekends. People
standing or not fitting in the bus deters then from ever riding again. It's crazy under staffed on
holidays
We always use the AB route to get from Boulder to the airport and back, the last 6 months
have been unreliable and crowded. It is often completely full and sometimes passengers are
not able to board. Since there is less flexibility in air travel, it makes it less appealing to use
this route at all. Making the schedule more reliable and more often would be appreciated and
meet the demand.
Please increase frequency and on-time performance. It is such a useful service. I use it for
work trips. I park at work and take this bus to the airport. However it is so frustrating when
the bus is full or if missed. In would be great Sid it was every 30 min
Increase hours of service. Late night and early morning flights sometimes cannot be
accommodated with the current schedule. Please look into expanding schedule times.
Please increase AB frequency. I know RTD despises Boulder and Broomfield, but the current
buses are at capacity every single time…
The minor adjustments to help o time performance is great. But please add more times! The
bus is always full. It’s hard to know when it’s coming at DIA because the real time tracking is
rarely accurate there. Thank you!

BOLT:
• Having more frequent buses during rush hour (busses coming every 15 minutes in the
mornings and afternoons) would help 1) riders have more flexibility to arrive to their
workplace at their scheduled start times and 2) give riders more space on the bus. In the
afternoon Bolt bus for 4:07pm during school season, many students ride the Bolt after school
at the Downtown Boulder Station (northbound) to reach another part of Boulder. They most
likely switch between the 204 and the Bolt depending on which is more convenient to use in

the moment. When they ride at 4:07pm Bolt bus (northbound), the bus is usually completely
full by the time it reached stops on 28th street, leaving many riders standing in the aisle until
students get off further down the routine in Boulder. An overloaded bus doesn't seem safe, so
breaking the schedule into 15 minute increments could prevent this.

MetroRide:
• The freeMetroRide is a vital form of transportation throughout Downtown and is more than
just a support for the MallRide. It is a way to quickly reach one end of downtown to the other
without having to stop at each block. Furthermore, since it was a part of FasTracks, taxpayers
are expecting service that they paid for to remain especially since the infrastructure and buses
for the MetroRide have been sitting around ever since.
• The free metroride is helpful for getting to work on time. The bus is very clean and efficient
compared to other routes to use for downtown office commuters. Even peak travel service
would be useful in the morning and afternoon commute periods.
• Increasing the frequency on the Mall Ride to five minutes is better than continuing the Metro
Ride.
• As somebody who regularly commuter between Civic Center and Union Station, the Free
Metroride has definitely my favorite way to get between the two, as it feels the fastest, and it
stops in the Union Station bus concourse making it way easier for me to transfer to other
busses such as the FF or the LD. It's also backwards on your system optimization plan, as it
promises to bring back the FMR. Please if possible keep the FMR running, and make the
sacrifice of keeping the Mallride at 10 min headways, which currently doesn't even run along
16th Street mall at the moment, do at least until the mall reopens keep the FMR.
• I STRONGLY urge you continue operations on the Free MetroRide at least until the 16th Street
Mall construction is completed. As it stands now, the Free MallRide is an insufficient transit
option to reach the core of downtown with it's spaced out stops, and operations on 15th and
17th street. To increase service to 5 minutes while cutting out a needed and honestly quicker
connection between Union Station and Civic Center Station would not be a wise decision. The
MetroRide also provides a needed connection to the northern downtown area and I've noticed
a decent amount of workers boarding and alighting during peak hours. What this route needs
is improved regional connections, like increased E and H line frequencies, and the D, H, and L
lines returning to central downtown to support and boost ridership on the FMR. Please
consider continuing service on this route and the MallRide at 10 minute frequencies and the
addition of more frequent LRT service will booster better connections within the downtown
area.
• This service provides a way for people north of Coors Field to get downtown for work, events
and entertainment. There are very few routes from this area to get downtown on a frequent
basis by using public transportation. So driving or not going is what happens when this is not
available. I used to take it for work and other errands.
• Keep the mall ride at reduced schedule to keep the MetroRide!

Please don’t discontinue MetroRide! I have loved being able to quickly and efficiently get from
DUS to Civic Center this summer. It’s so much faster than MallRide and a lot cleaner. It’s
commuters getting to the Capitol area. It’s highly used too.
I am disappointed that you cut
so much service during the pandemic and then have not restored it. Having the MetroRide this
summer has been a bright spot. Please maintain. Thanks!
The MetroRide provides far more convenient service to Coors Field and Union Station than the
MallRide does, especially for those of us that work in Uptown. I would strongly ask that RTD
keep both buses’ schedules the same at this time.
The MetroRide is the only decent way to get from Union Statiom to the south end of
downtown. The mall bus is extremely slow (you can literally walk faster) and isn’t a great
environment (homeless, drug users, etc.) for professional commuters.
Can you please keep the Free MetroRide? Before the pandemic it only ran in the morning
during peak hours and afternoon during peak hours. It is the only good route for commuters
that ride RTD into Denver Union Station. It has fewer stops than the Free MallRide and
frankly is cleaner a more professional ridership.
The only better option would be to bring
back the Sheridan and 92nd bus that traveled directly to Civic Center. Again this Bus only ran
during morning and afternoon peak hours.

Kevin M: Mentioned that they had concerns about the ADA compliance of the stops
outside of Boulder Station that the Flatiron Flyer was using while the station was closed,
was very tight for their wheelchair. Also wondered if the bathrooms at that station had
been evaluated for accessibility. Asked about the route between Golden and Boulder, staff
mentioned that it was the GS and that it was operating again. They mentioned that it was
one of their favorites because it’s so scenic. Aked about the route 16 in Golden and recent
changes. Staff explained about the 16/17 change that was recently implemented as part
of the System Optimization Plan. They asked about yellow straps that RTD used to provide
wheelchair users to help secure them, said it’s especially needed on the NB. They asked
about service to Rapids games. Staff mentioned that the 62 that previously provided
service to the stadium, was discontinued due to poor ridership. They mentioned that the
real-time information is not always working and that it’s frustrating. Also inquired about
current operator headcount, had noticed a lot of cancellations due “no operator available,”
which they mentioned was frustrating. Asked if that meant there would be service cuts as
a result. Staff mentioned that there are more people taking vacations in the summer, that
headcounts are trending in a positive direction and they do not anticipate having to make
service cuts as a result. Was also curious about the recent partnership with CDOT and
Bustang. Staff provided further clarification. Also asked about bus fleet electrification.
Staff informed them of the Fleet and Facilities Transition Plan project that is currently
underway.

Scott L: Wondered about the impact of the Zero Fare for Youth program on ridership. Staff
mentioned the limitations and anonymization of current data collection methods, but that
anecdotally (through operators, observations, and ridership on certain routes at certain
times of day) that it has increased ridership and that survey methods are expected to be
used for further data collection and analysis as part of the program and reporting.

Chris T: Had multiple questions and concerns regarding multiple bus routes and operator
procedures/conduct. First comment regarded the SB Route 35 stop at Dartmouth and
Raleigh (near the school) being clogged due to personal vehicles being parked/temporarily
located in the bus stop landing area (perhaps around school start/end times, but no time
was given as an example of when issue occurs). Voiced concern over three recent
instances of operators getting out of their seats to confront passengers (one on Route 51,
another on Route 15L, third incident Route N/A), said they confronted the operators in
each instance and made a customer care report to RTD the same day in each instance.
Identified themselves as a certified HAM Radio operator and complained that an operator

Jim Tegart: He lives in Littleton and rides the 0 to connect to the Route 6 to volunteer at
the Wings Over the Rockies Museum location in Aurora, and is concerned over the split of
the Route 0 into the Routes 0 and 0B at Englewood Station come the Sep24 runboard (as
this would force an additional transfer in both directions). Also asked about the old 0L
route which went to Southglenn, which he said would better meet the needs of
commuters. Dan responded that the 0-0B split was intended to improve on-time
performance for both routes by splitting them at Englewood Station, and indicated that
running times for both routes were designed to allow for timed transfers at Englewood
Station. Dan also mentioned that the 0L is intended to travel between Civic Center Station
and I-25/Broadway Station to improve connections between those two points and does
not intend to return old 0L routing to Southglenn. Jessie concurred with Dan’s statements.
Phil Clerner: Says he rides the D Line light rail and is very disappointed that RTD did not do
more to make its constituents aware of the impacts stemming from this summer’s
concurrent construction projects (mostly the speed restriction order). Wanted faster
response times due to this impending issue and asked if there would be assurances made
so that the lack of communication would not be repeated in the future. Jessie on behalf of
RTD apologized for the lack of communication and mentioned that RTD uses a variety of
banners and service alerts on the website/app to make riders aware of service
changes/disruptions and to keep an eye on the website for more information as the
projects progress.
Jackson Ledesma: Jackson had multiple comments, questions, and complaints (some of
which are in the written notes – please refer to the written comments for more
information). His first question was a concern over the potential need to add blocks to
either/both of the new 0/0B to ensure headways (using the example of the Routes 7 and
12 split and the subsequent need to add blocks to keep service headways). Dan said that
no blocks would need to be added at this time but mentioned that an additional block
could be added later if needed. Jackson’s second question was about guaranteed
(protected) transfers at Englewood Station between the 0 and 0B. Dan mentioned that
running times had been adjusted to improve timeliness of transfers between the routes.
Third question voiced confusion over why the ‘0B’ was chosen as the name of the
southern portion of the existing 0 route for the 0-0B split given that it sounds like a
spur/branch number, and that this designation may not be self-explanatory for riders as a
unique route. Dan and Jessie explained that the existing Route 0 number limited RTD’s
options for naming the new route, so RTD ultimately went with 0B. Fourth question asked
about the potential use of articulated 60-foot buses on the 0B. Dan said that RTD is

Attachment: Attachment C (4976 : September 2024 Service Change)

recently asked them to turn the radio down while sitting on the bus near the operator’s
seat. Made compliments about light rail station cleanliness in recent time and the RTD bus
operators who have gone above and beyond in their line of work to make the lives of
passengers easier. Jessie thanked them for voicing the operator concerns and for sending
in customer care complaints in a timely manner and thanked them for the compliments and
suggestions.

Packet Pg. 401

looking into the use of articulated 60-foot buses on the 0B but mentioned that there might
be logistics issues involved since private contractor garages do not currently have capacity
for articulated bus storage and maintenance. Fifth question regarded the return of
improved frequency on the Free 16th St. Mall Shuttle and Free MetroRide services in
downtown Denver at the end of the seasonal summer construction work for the
downtown rail replacement project. Sixth question regarded school trippers on the Route
51 still appearing on May24 traincards (operator schedule) even though school is not in
session for summer break. Seventh question was if the Route 38 would be terminating at
the new Lutheran Hospital at Clear Creek Crossing in Wheat Ridge instead of at Wheat
Ridge/Ward Station. Dan said that the route change is intended per the construction of a
compliant landing area by the developer at the intended site. Eighth question was about
the possible increase of headways or the use of articulated 60-foot buses on the Route 16
due to existing ridership congestion. Dan mentioned that RTD has run safety checks on
the route with articulated buses and said that articulated buses may be put into use on the
Route 16 in the near future. Jackson also wrote down additional suggestions which have
been added to the service change record.
Brian Hernan: Asked about what RTD is doing to expand rail/rapid bus service along the
C470 corridor/generally expand services throughout the Denver Metro area. Wants
improved connections to entice drivers out of their vehicles and onto transit. Jessie said
that it is difficult to implement new service to all regions of the Denver Metro area at this
time given shifts in commuter habits stemming from the Pandemic and available
budget/operator counts. However, he also insisted that the RTD is committed to improving
service throughout the district and continually searches for avenues to positively impact
the overall customer experience.
Meeting closed at 6:30 PM.

Dr. Ramming wanted to know about why the Free Metro Ride is being suspended in
September after just being brought back in May. It was explained that the FMR was a
temporary measure to address the reduction of rail service during the Downtown Rail
Replacement Project. Dan Merritt explained that the frequency of the Mall Ride was
reduced to provide operators for the Free MetroRide. It was also stated that other
customers would like to see the Free Mall Ride returned to higher service levels with the
completion of Phase One of DRRP.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Bylaw Amendment to Allow the Chair to Appoint Committee
Members in Certain Circumstances

July 25, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board to amend Article VI, Section 1(a) to empower the Chair of the Board to make certain
committee appointments.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On October 26, 2021, the Board approved Bylaw amendments that changed the composition of the
Board’s committees as well as how Directors become members of a given committee. The process
approved in October 2021 governs how committee appointments are made. Currently, the Executive
Committee makes the committee appointments, typically during a Special Executive Committee Meeting
in early-to-mid January each year, and those appointments are then ratified by the full Board during the
regular Board meeting later that month.
While this system has worked well, it does not account for a vacancy arising on a committee following
the initial appointments. On February 27, 2024, Director Lewis was sworn into his Director office to fill
the seat vacated by former Director Williams on January 10, 2024. However, Director Lewis was not
able to serve on a standing committee his first month on the Board as there was neither a vacancy nor a
process to place him into a committee assignment before the Executive Committee met in March. To
accommodate Director Lewis coming onto the Board, Director Buzek stepped down from what was then
known as the Operations and Safety Committee at the conclusion of its March 13, 2024, meeting. The
Executive Committee then appointed Director Lewis to the Committee on March 21, 2024, and the full
Board ratified the appointment during the monthly Board meeting held on March 26, 2024.
The proposed amendment to the Bylaws allows the Chair to make a committee appointment in the event
of a committee membership vacancy arising after the Executive Committee’s annual process to appoint
committee members, thus avoiding a situation whereby a new Director is not afforded the opportunity to
serve on a committee for some period of time following their appointment to the Board.

Packet Pg. 411

16.H

Additionally, the July 13, 2022, Operations and Safety Committee meeting was cancelled due to a lack
of quorum. This resulted in the need for a Special Board meeting to be calendared for July 26, 2022.
The proposed Bylaw amendment would also allow the Chair to make a temporary appointment to a
committee for purposes of ensuring a quorum. This ability could also be utilized to temporarily appoint a
committee member in the event of a prolonged temporary absence of a Director from their duties.
This item was originally scheduled to be heard at the May 2024 Executive Committee meeting but was
tabled to the June 2024 Executive Committee meeting where it was subsequently discussed. The item
is now returning to the Committee as a Recommended Action.
INFORMATION
The Executive Committee is asked to review and vote to recommend to the full Board the following
Bylaw amendment. Should the committee vote to recommend this action to the full board, it will appear
on the agenda for the July 30, 2024 regular Board meeting.
Proposed Bylaw Amendment to Article VI, Section 1(a), to add:
In the event a committee vacancy arises after the Board’s ratification, the Chair of the Board shall
appoint a Director to fill the vacancy, subject to ratification by the full Board. This appointment
shall take effect upon notification to the Board. To ensure a quorum, the Chair is authorized to
temporarily appoint a Director to a standing committee with such appointment effective upon
notification to the Board through the end of the committee meeting(s) for which the member was
appointed.
All Bylaw amendments require 10 affirmative votes to be approved. If approved the amendment would
take effect at the conclusion of the meeting during which this Recommended Action is adopted.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priority of Community Value as the Board must ensure the
community is appropriately represented and that meetings of the Board are not cancelled due to a lack of
quorum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to amending the Bylaws.

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.
ARTICLE III – OFFICE
The Board may designate, locate and relocate its executive and business office and such other offices or divisions
as in its judgment are needed to conduct the business of the District. The office of the Board shall be located
within the RTD District.
ARTICLE IV – MEETINGS
Section 1.

REGULAR BOARD MEETINGS

Regular Board meetings shall be held on the fourth Tuesday of each month, at 5:30 p.m. Unless necessary

two days for the purposes of strategic planning, establishing annual Board priorities, and providing the

State Audit. The schedule for the annual Board Planning Meeting will provide sufficient time to incorporate
the meeting outcomes into initial phases of the District’s budget planning cycle.
Section 5.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Property Station Naming Policies

July 25, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended for the Board to approve both the Property and Station Naming Policy as well as the
Honorary Property and Station Naming Policy, Procedures, and Naming Reivew Rubric.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the Board meeting held on January 25, 2024, the Board provided direction to have staff work
with Directors Sloan and Ruscha to review RTD’s current station naming policy, comprised of three prior
Board actions (1994, 2003, and 2011), coalesce that policy into a unified document, and propose a
means by which the Board could add an honorary name to an RTD property or station.
A working group comprised of Director Sloan, Director Ruscha, Government Relations Officer Michael
Davies, and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll met three times prior to the March 2024
Executive Committee meeting during which a discussion on the draft policy and procedures was set to
initially occur. During these discussions the working group reviewed RTD’s current policies and analyzed
policies from other transit agencies, which included the Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority,
the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (Houston Metro), the Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro), and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA). The working group received additional input from senior staff, other Directors, the
Advisory Committee for Persons with Disabilities, and the Citizens Advisory Committee. The working
group produced draft policies and procedures and presented those items for further board input during
the Board’s April Executive Committee and regular full Board meetings. While the item was originally
scheduled to come before the Executive Committee and full Board in March 2024, the March Executive
Committee meeting encountered time constraints and consideration of the matter was postponed to the
April 2024 meetings of the Executive Committee and full Board.

Packet Pg. 455

16.I

During the Board meeting held on April 30, 2024, Directors provided general feedback, and several
Directors requested that the working group develop a rubric to help objectively guide the review of
proposals to add an honorary name to a property or station. Following the April Board meeting, the
working group met an additional four times during May, June, and July 2024 to develop a rubric and
incorporate additional staff and Director feedback into the policies and procedures.
Accompanying this Recommended Action is a document that coalesces and proposes minor changes to
the draft Property and Station Naming Policy, as well as a document containing the subsidiary policy,
procedures, and review rubric to govern any addition of an honorary name to a property or station.
DISCUSSION
The working group is submitting the attached documents for Board review and approval. Directors are
asked to review these documents, offer any amendments (preferably in advance of the meeting), and
vote to adopt them.
Should the Board approve these policies and procedures, the Board Office would work to develop an
honorary property and station name application to add to the Board’s website. Likewise, the Board
Office would work with other staff members to ensure the communities RTD serves are made aware of
the opportunity to apply to add an honorary name to a RTD property or station. The Board Office
anticipates that work to be completed no later than October 1, 2024.
It should be noted that, in the course of its work, the working group identified areas the Board may wish
to explore further in the future. Those would be to: review existing policies and procedures related to
public art on RTD properties and stations; discuss the possibility of creating a policy and an associated
process for enacting a temporary honorary name for an RTD property or station; and review and discuss
holistically the current policy that allows for RTD stations to be eligible for corporate sponsorships.
This action aligns with the Strategic Priority of Community Value as how RTD approaches naming its
properties and stations directly impacts the communities in which RTD facilities are located.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While there is no direct financial impact to changing the Board policies discussed above, there would be
significant costs to change the name of or add an honorary name to any property or station. Those costs
would need to be identified so that the Board could make an informed decision regarding whether to
change the name of, or add an honorary name to, any property or station.

PROPERTY AND STATION NAMING POLICY
ADOPTED: TBD
PRIMARY PROPERTY AND STATION NAMES

RTD aims to establish primary property and station names that are recognizable to our customers as destinations.
Per Board policy passed in 1994 and reaffirmed in 2003 and 2011, RTD stations are usually named for the
nearest street intersections, major cross street, or the name of the geographic location of the area. Names
should be kept relatively short so that they will fit efficiently on destination signs, station signs, maps, and other
materials.
RTD staff will work with local governments and stakeholders to develop station/facility names for new stations
that differ from the above policy as long as:
•
•

•
II.

The name is recognizable to the general traveling public
The name does not incorporate any trademarked names with value to the private sector or that have
commercially-viable or valuable benefits (absent compensation to RTD as described under sponsorships
below)
The name does not violate any existing naming agreement
HONORARY PROPERTY NAMES

The Board may add an honorary name, as a secondary name, to any RTD station or property. The policy,
procedures, and requirements of which are set forth in the separate, subsidiary Honorary Property and Station
Naming Policy, Honorary Property Station Naming Procedures, and Honorary Property and Station Naming
Review Rubric.
An honorary name can be applied only if doing so does not violate any existing naming agreement.
III. SPONSORSHIPS
RTD staff may, with Board approval, sell naming rights, by means of a public solicitation process, to RTD stations
and facilities under a multi-year contractual agreement provided:
•
•

•
•

The core station/facility name must remain as a “location identifier” for the traveling public
To be considered as viable, the sale of naming rights would need to generate positive net revenue to
RTD after fully accounting for RTD’s costs of changing the station/facility name (station signs, maps,
collateral material, recorded announcements, etc.) as well as foregone revenue from other sources
The name does not violate any existing naming agreement
Sponsorships will not be considered for a station with an honorary name

IV. NAME CHANGE COST
Entities proposing non-honorary name changes under this policy would be required to absorb all associated costs
unless the Board determines otherwise.

wayfinding/geographic identifier.
II.

SCOPE

The policy applies to transit stations, park-n-rides, transfer centers, other major passenger facilities, maintenance
facilities, and administrative buildings.
III. AUTHORITY
The Board shall approve any amendments to this policy and associated procedures.
IV. ELIGIBILTY CRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR AN HONORARY PROPERTY NAME ADOPTION

HONORARY PROPERTY AND STATION NAMING REVIEW RUBRIC
ADOPTED: TBD
I.

PURPOSE

The rubric is designed to assist the Review Committee in its work to objectively and fairly evaluate proposals to
add an honorary name to an RTD property. An effective rubric should help the Review Committee be more
efficient and consistent in its review, while also signaling to potential applicants the committee’s expectations.
II.

CHANGES TO THE RUBRIC

The Board of Directors may change the rubric and encourages the Review Committee as well as public to provide
feedback on ways to improve the rubric on an on-going basis.
III. OVERVIEW
Evaluators are asked to review each application using the following rubric. Applications for honorary names
should be assessed relative to the application’s ability to convey the extent to which the proposed individual,
group or event has historical significance to RTD and/or transit, significant community support, and aligns with
RTD’s values. Each criterion is scored individually on a 1-7 scale, with the total points possible being 21.
Committee members scores will be aggregated and discussed before the committee invites those who submitted
top-scoring applications to meet with the committee to further discuss their proposals.

ACTIONJL DISCUSSION_ INFO_

The Rapid Transit Oversight Co11111ittee recommends that the Board of Directors affirm the
policy to name light rail stations according to their geographic location.
BACKGROUND
Station names for the Central Corridor have been established using this policy, and
station signs are currently being manufactured as follows (from south to north):

•

1-25 & Broadway
Alameda
10th &Osage
Colfax at Auraria
14th &Stout

29th &Welton
30th & Downing

DISCUSSION
The issue of setting a Board policy for light rail station names was raised at a Rapid
Transit Oversight Co11111ittee. Staff explained that the most common method of naming
stations is after the cross streets where the station is located. This is done because
it gives the customers the exact location to either board or deboard the train, and
makes it easier for customers who are not familiar with the area.
The Committee requested staff to research station naming policies at a few other
transit properties. Portland, Sacramento and San Jose were surveyed. None of the
three cities have an actual Board policy. A summary of the survey follows:
Portland:

Their Consumer Programs Division determines the names of their light rail
stations after receiving input from the public. Their goal is to keep the
station names neutral. Many of their stations are named after cross
streets, but a few have names of historical sites at the station
locations. They do have a Convention Center Station and a Coliseum
Transit Center. They are willing to name stations after individuals if
local donations are given .

RECOMMENDATION

16.I.e

.LRT Station Names
May 20, 1994
Page Two

San Jose:

Staff made reconrnendations that were given to and passed by the Board of
Directors. The majority of stations are named after cross streets which
makes it easier for the passengers to find the stations. A few stations
are named after historic sites and a couple have joint names such as
Japantown/Ayer (Japantown is the area of the city where the station is,
and Ayer is the name of the street).

The Rapid Transit Oversight Committee agreed unanimously to approve the list of station
names which were chosen based on their proximity to street locations.
ALTERNATIVES
I.

Affirm the policy to name light rail stations according to their geographic
location. This is the recommended action.
Generate a modified or different policy for the naming of light rail stations.
This is not recommended because the geographic location concept is important for
customer ease of system use; and the station signs are already being
manufactured.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact if the reco1TUDended action is taken. If the station names
