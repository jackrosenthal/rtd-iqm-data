BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2021, the Board Office solicited feedback from the Board on which standing
committees each Director was interested in serving in 2022. The Board Office compiled responses from
the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 6, 2021 Executive
Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:
Finance and Planning Committee
Bob Broom

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Rail Repair Budget Transfer

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $589,000 from the Unrestricted Fund balance
to the 2022 General Fund budget for the 20th and Welton rail replacement project (project).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Central Corridor rail line running from 30th•Downing Station to I-25•Broadway Station was
completed in 1994. The portion of the corridor near the 20th St.•Welton Station was identified by the
Capital Programs department as an area in need of critical rail remediation due to rail and concrete wear.
In August 2020, a fire occurred in a cable vault near the 20th St.•Welton Station, severely damaging
the cables supplying power for rail service. Maintenance of Way teams were able to restore power in the
short-term to maintain service delivery, though the interim repairs do not provide system redundancy
should a subsequent event occur.
The project fully restores the rail system power supply system.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
Unexpended budgeted dollars in FY2021 were reverted to the Unrestricted Fund in FY2022 absent a
carryforward appropriation. Due to unanticipated delays, a project carryforward in the amount of
$589,000 for the procurement of items needed for the project was not included in the 2022 Budget
appropriation, as those items were initially expected to be purchased and received in FY2021. This
budget transfer restores the unexpended funding to the project as originally intended.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Exercise Contract 19FK002 Options to Purchase 117 40foot and 25 30-foot Transit Buses

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to exercise options and to amend
contract 19FK002 (contract) with Gillig LLC (Gillig) to purchase 117 40-foot and 25 30-foot transit
buses, along with associated spare parts and training, for a total price not to exceed $70,271,993.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 24, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the purchase of 46 40-foot transit buses with
options for an additional 264 buses over a five-year period under the contract.
On Feb 25, 2020, the Board approved the exercise of contract options for 34 additional 40-foot buses.
Exercising options for the purchase of 117 40-foot and 25 30-foot buses will continue the fleet
replacement of the agency’s existing bus fleet that has met its useful life and is consistent with the
agency’s fleet replacement plan.
The buses included in this purchase are equipped similarly to other vehicles recently purchased under the
contract. The 40-foot buses include a seating arrangement with offset areas to maximize space for
customers who utilize mobility devices. Given the differences in base configuration between the 40-foot
and 30-foot buses, RTD will work with Gillig to optimize the seating arrangement on the 30-foot buses
for all customers.
All the buses are equipped with clean diesel engines meeting the current Environmental Protection
Agency emissions requirements. Estimated lifetime vehicle emissions from each bus will be significantly
reduced, by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases, 6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides and 0.25 tons of particulate
matter, as compared to the buses being replaced, which were purchased in 2005 and manufactured in
2006.
Gillig pricing is based on initial base contract pricing plus:
• An inflationary price (4.89%) adjustment computed using the U.S. Department of Labor’s
“Producer Price Index” or PPI which is published monthly, and
• Equipment changes
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency is striving to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence and Financial Success. In addition to producing
higher vehicle emissions as cited herein, the buses to be replaced have become prone to on-the-road

Packet Pg. 28

14.C

failures and are expensive to maintain, as they have met or exceeded their useful life as deemed by the
Federal Transit Administration of 500,000 miles or 12 years. The buses to be procured produce fewer
emissions, have lower downtime, maintenance costs and are more comfortable and reliable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the recommended action will create a financial impact not to exceed $70,271,993, the
funding for which is included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Boulder HOP Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to enter into an agreement with
the City of Boulder (Boulder) to provide funding to support the HOP bus service in an amount not to
exceed $1,356,928.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Senior Manager, Contracted Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD provides extensive bus service to, from and within Boulder. Since 1994, Boulder has supplemented
RTD’s service within the city by providing circulator service, known as the HOP. The HOP provides
mobility and access to Boulder’s commercial areas, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent
business and residential developments. Additionally, the HOP connects to many local and regional RTD
bus routes, as well as with the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at Depot Square Stations.
RTD financial support, along with supplemental funding from Boulder, is used to fund operations and fuel
costs for the HOP bus service.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. From January through November of 2021, the HOP has averaged approximately 673
boardings per day, a 68% reduction from 2019, when average daily boardings for the same period were
2,121.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action, as HOP program
funding support for calendar year 2022 was included in the 2022 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 DRCOG Vanpooling Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to enter into an agreement with
the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide financial support, in an amount not to
exceed $663,000, for calendar year 2022 for the Way to Go vanpool program operations in the Denver
metropolitan area.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Senior Manager, Contracted Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The DRCOG Way to Go Vanpool program (program) provides mobility options for program participants
through ridesharing opportunities. RTD has provided financial support for the program’s vanpools
operating within the agency’s service area since April 2001.
Vanpooling is a transit option in which individuals whose residences are in close geographical proximity
commute to and from their work sites on a regular basis utilizing vans provided by a third-party entity.
Typically, vanpool vans carry six to 12 passengers and are operated and maintained by one of the
vanpool participants. Vanpools provide regularly scheduled, personalized transportation at a low cost and
offer increased capacity as compared to carpools.
By reducing individuals’ reliance on single-occupancy vehicles, the program provides enhanced mobility
options, reduces traffic congestion, and improves air quality.
Through the agency’s financial support, the program’s fares can be more competitive in the transit
marketplace. Funding is also used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool operators and
provide capital funding to acquire necessary vehicles.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. While fewer vanpools are active in January 2022 than prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, as of November 2021, the program’s vanpool fleet is at 78.5% capacity, serving an average
of 5.3 individuals per van, which represents a respective improvement over pre-COVID-19 ridership
levels in 2019.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action, as
funding for support of the vanpool program for calendar year 2022 was included in the 2022 Budget.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Internal Audit Consulting and Advisory Services Contract

Committee Meeting Date:
January 20, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to engage in a solicitation for a
professional services firm for the provision of internal audit consulting and advisory services.
This action is recommended by the members of the Audit Ad Hoc Committee, Directors Peggy Catlin,
Erik Davidson, and Bobby Dishell.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2020 and 2021, RTD’s internal audit function was subject to review by external entities, namely the
Office of the State Auditor (OSA) and a peer review panel requested of the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) by the General Manager and CEO. The performance audit performed
by OSA and the review performed by the APTA panel both resulted in overarching findings and
recommendations regarding the operation of the internal audit function and the Board’s Audit
Committee.
The internal audit function of a public entity:
• Is an independent and objective assurance and consulting function
• Is guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the entity’s operations
• Utilizes a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the
entity’s governance, risk management, and internal controls
Following the OSA and APTA reviews, RTD launched a process to align its internal audit function with
recognized audit standards and practices of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International Standards
for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, in tandem with the Global Public Sector Insight:
Independent Audit Committees in Public Sector Organizations.
On July 19, 2021, RTD published a request for quotations from consultants for internal audit
improvements, with the intent to:

Packet Pg. 34

14.F

•
•
•

Align the internal audit function with recognized audit standards and practices of the Institute of
Internal Auditors International Professional Practice Framework
Ensure the efficacy of this function according to auditing best practices
Implement recommendations from the OSA audit and the APTA peer review

RubinBrown was selected as the audit consultant in August 2021 and was tasked with undertaking the
following objectives, the results of which were presented to the Board during the Special Board Meeting
held on January 4, 2022:
• Understand and incorporate the findings from the OSA and APTA reviews
• Define an optimal internal audit structure
• Recommend an optimal structure for Board’s Audit Committee
• Provide examples and best practices of internal audit charters and provide recommendations for
improvements to agency’s internal audit charter
• Perform an enterprise risk assessment (ERA) and establish the templates and process for future
ERAs
• Perform a peer comparison
• Provide an internal audit report template and audit software recommendations
• Assist with resource selection for additional internal audit resources
During the Executive Committee meeting held on January 6, 2022, Board Chair Vince Buzek appointed
Directors Peggy Catlin, Erik Davidson, and Bobby Dishell to serve as members of the Audit Ad Hoc
Committee (committee). In its first meeting, the committee coalesced around the objective of
establishing a sustainable internal audit function with governance in adherence to the standards and best
practices to minimize risk and exposure to the enterprise for the betterment of the agency.
DISCUSSION
In consideration of recommendations from the Office of the State Auditor, the APTA peer review panel,
and RubinBrown, the third-party professional services firm retained to review the agency’s internal audit
function and recommend best practices for the function’s structure and operations, RTD seeks
consulting and advisory services in order to outsource its internal audit function to ensure alignment with
recognized audit standards and best practices as described herein.
Due to the wide-ranging impacts of an effective, comprehensive internal audit function on an agency’s
operations, in adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action, as the
costs for internal audit consulting and advising services were included in the 2022 Budget.
