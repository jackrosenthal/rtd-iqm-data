COMMITTEE WORKPLAN APPROVAL
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Performance Committee Work Plan

March 3, 2025

COMMITTEE ACTION
For the Performance Committee to approve the 2025 Committee Work Plan.
REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board. The work plan before the committee will cover meetings
through February 2026.
Per Article VI, Section 1, f.), describes the role of the Performance Committee as follows:
The Performance Committee has three oversight functions: 1) Performance management of the
General Manager and CEO, 2) in close coordination with the General Manager and CEO, the
development, ongoing review, and subsequent amendment of long-range strategic planning
efforts, including the agency’s Strategic Plan, 3) high-level monitoring of agency performance in
relation to the Strategic Plan.
With respect to the performance management of the GM/CEO, the committee has primary
oversight over the GM/CEO’s employment agreement, annual goalsetting, the annual performance
assessment framework, and annual performance assessment. The Performance Committee is also
the appropriate venue through which the Board members periodically engage in dialogue with the
GM/CEO to discuss feedback regarding the GM/CEO’s ongoing performance.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring performance metrics related to, and progress
toward, the agency’s Strategic Plan. The Committee will collaborate with the GM/CEO to set the
cadence, timing, and topics of performance updates relative to the Strategic Plan when
developing and adopting its annual committee work plan.

DISCUSSION
The Committee utilized meeting time at its January 21, 2025 and February 3, 2025 meetings.
Additionally, General Manager and CEO Johnson further coordinated with Committee Leadership in a
subsequent meeting on February 24, 2025 to hone the work plan.
Directors are asked to review and make any additional changes to the work plan before voting to
approve the work plan.
Once approved by the Committee, the work plan, will be forwarded to the full Board for review. The
approved work plan may be adjusted by the Chair of the committee in consultation with the committee’s
Vice Chair and responsible RTD staff. It is expected that the timing of some items may shift throughout
the course of the work plan.
This discussion and approval align with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Performance Committee’s ability to
effectively govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. An organized committee work
plan will ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance
objectives are more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Key Organizational Performance Metrics – Q1 2025 InDepth

March 3, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Strategic Plan
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome. The revised Agency
Performance Scorecard, which captures metrics used to gauge progress toward these outcomes and
serves as a tool to frame the conversation regarding the agency’s operational, financial, well-being, was
approved during the monthly Board meeting on Tuesday, October 22, 2024.
Strategic Initiatives
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff designed efforts to improve agency performance in specific areas identified within the
Strategic Priorities. These efforts were distilled into four overarching Strategic Initiatives, which reflect
a renewed collective focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the Success Outcomes:
•
•

Back to Basics: RTD strives to redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good
repair leveraging sound asset management principles.
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important

•

•

resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.
Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve
community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.
Customer and Community Connections: RTD is committed to fostering community building and
enriching the customer experience.

Performance Dashboard
The Performance Dashboard, which launched on RTD’s website in May 2024, serves as an easily
accessible repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The Performance Dashboard
contains data, graphics, and linked information related to the agency budget and financial reports,
people power statistics, and other key measurements. The Performance Dashboard enhances agency
transparency and assists the Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
DISCUSSION
During the Performance Committee scheduled for Monday, March 3, 2024, committee members and
staff review data and trends related to metrics captured in the Agency Performance Scorecard, and
staff will present information specifically pertaining to the Strategic Priority of Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.
