## II. October Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Sisk asked General Manager Washington to review the action items for this agenda.  General Manager Washington indicated that three of the retirees are expected to be present for the meeting.  He indicated that all items had passed committee and asked if there were any specific questions or concerns.

Motion:               Director Tobiassen made the motion to move the October Board Agenda forward to the October 28 Board meeting.

Director James seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy inquired if the changes to the call-n-ride had been incorporated.  General Manager Washington indicated this is correct.

Director Sisk also inquired if the timeline that he had requested on the ACS Smart Card project could be included with the Board report for the Board meeting and accessible by the public.  Phil Washington and Paula Perdue indicated they would try to figure the best way to make this happen.

Director Hoy expressed his apologies about his question on the free military rides that generated conversation and stated he appreciated the explanation provided by Director Tobiassen and others about the reason we approve this on an annual basis.  Director James expressed his thought the explanation was helpful to him and to others who may come on the Board and wondered if there was a way to incorporate this into the report.

Chair Sisk noted we might expect large crowds under public participation, particularly having to do with the 18th street traffic and Nine to Five.

General Manager Washington was asked to comment on the article about the reconstruction of the Jersey Bridge.  General Manager Washington indicated that the press was referred to Laura Rinker with DTP.  He expressed we have a wonderful relationship with our partners and this is really a good story.  The beauty of the PPP is the design, build and operate component where everyone including the partner has skin in the game to make sure we have a bridge that will hold over the lifetime of the P3 relationship.  Our partner has stepped up to the plate to make the necessary changes without cost to RTD or impact to the schedule.

Pertaining to the GM Oversight and Performance Management Update, Director Bagley indicated he will discuss that we have begun the process for the GM annual performance evaluation which will continue through the early part of December.  This is a very methodical and organized process to ensure the full Board can participate and that we are transparent.

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed with 5 committee members in favor.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

## III. Other Matters

Other Matters:

- Director Bagley indicated what an honor to have our General Manager as Chair of APTA.  He requested the Chair of the Board to do something in acknowledgement.

- Director Bagley provided comments and some historical perspective to the contract for the DUS Crawford Hotel.  He reminded the committee of the contract process where the two proposers were significantly different in their approach and use for the space.  He believes the better option was selected.  USA had to work with the preservation as well as Denver Landmark to make sure the restoration met the requirements. The Union Station advocates were very active.  USA did a couple of focus groups around what did people want to experience and what kind of tenants they wanted.  Results from these focus groups and surveys indicated they wanted the appeal of a “living room” and did not desire any chains. He shared that he had taken a couple of friends to DUS and had spoken to Walter Eisenberg of Sage and Jo with Larimer Associates.  They had shared this is exceeding expectations and RTD has lots to benefit from DUS.

Director James added this is an iconic building where choices had to be made.  It is really a question of what level of quality from the high end of the spectrum to the low end of the spectrum.  Either way would have brought its own critics.  He is pleased with the outcome.

Director Tobiassen added that what was important to him is that DUS became self-sustaining.  We have accomplished this goal.

Chair Sisk reflected on DUS as part of the overall FasTracks decision.  It was important that we have a hub that is multi-modal and transforms this region.  DUS has done that.  We need to focus on the positive good and visibility around the world that this center has created and embrace the positive that DUS is generating.

Director Folska added how well she thought the USA proposal was and how the team gelled and were fully integrated with a common vision.  This has been a great team effort. She wondered if there was a way to fully distinguish the role of RTD and USA.  General Manager Washington indicated we have done that where it makes sense and we have a great relationship with DUSPA and USA, our partners.

The full committee was in agreement that we need to focus on the business as appropriate, embrace the success of the overall DUS project and not be deterred by naysayers or unnecessary noise.

- General Manager Washington thanked the Board for their support for him as Chair of APTA.  He reminded the Committee that he had come to them two years ago when he was first approached for VP as APTA.  He was given a head nod. Now that he is Chair, APTA is working with him to make sure this does not conflict with his duties as CEO for the RTD Agency as this comes first.  In particular, APTA is working around his ongoing Tuesday night commitments for committees and Board meetings.  If he starts to see this is taking too much time away from his obligations here, he will be the first to call halt.  Conversely, if any Board members has a concern, they should let him know.  He sees two primary benefits to RTD in his role as APTA Chair:

- International exposure of RTD

- National stage-RTD has the opportunity to shape national transportation policy. His platform is based around the megatrends and issues that RTD has already started to explore.  Another component of this is his professional development.  The experience he is gaining as the APTA Chair enhances his knowledge, span of influence and his overall ability to be a more successful employee.  As the only employee of the Board, his professional growth trickles down to the rest of the agency where the overall performance of the agency improves.

- General Manager Washington spoke of the five megatrends that are part of his platform and that he shared in the APTA General Session:

§         Safety, security and unfunded mandates

§         Resources and funding-He has requested a national call for action in what he terms a National Infrastructure Advocacy day to be held April 1 and which coincides with when Congress is not in session.

§         Workforce-he is concerned if we will be people ready when money starts to flow again for building and sustaining our infrastructure.

§           Demographic Shift-more people are coming back into the urban areas.  There is some projection that over 2 million people will be moving back into the city.  Can our infrastructure accommodate this change.  Demographically, there is an ethnic shift where the minority is becoming the majority.

§         Accelerating Technological Changes and Innovations-How do we address these issues?

General Manager Washington shared that while at APTA annual, he had spoken with US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who offered his support for the platform that General Manager had laid out.

- General Manager Washington announced that Terry Howerter, CFO will be retiring at the end of the year.  He emphasized why the succession planning and his leadership development programs are key to ensuring we have a well prepared bench.

- The committee members expressed their support for General Manager Washington as the APTA Chair and how this is a good deal for RTD.  Director Walker noted that a strong leader especially on the national and international scene with the level of visibility calls for a strong Board.  The Board will need to step up their game in support.

- General Manager Washington noted there is a different dynamic that we can expect on the national and international scene.  Chair Sisk reiterated the support and stated how pleased he is with Phil’s leadership.  We have good success stories to share.  Director Bagley stated that being Chair of APTA is a big deal.  He talked about the meaning of the acronym team and stated that together everyone achieves more. Director Hoy expressed this is a good deal for the General Manager and if he wins, we all win.  We need to be pushing cohesively in the same direction.

- Paula Perdue expressed this was a good conversation and Director Walker’s comment around the Board stepping up its game segues into some of the things they are working on for the next year:

- There is an expectation that all the Board members will participate in the APTA TBM seminar that RTD will be hosting in 2015.  One of the session items that is up for discussion is how do we elevate the role of the Board as a high performance Board.  We expect this is a topic which will be of interest for all the Board members and transit properties.  We are also looking forward for General Manager Washington to share with both the Board members and the Board support staff about his Career Pathways.  There is a lot of interest in this area and Phil can talk to the actual implementation process of how you go about building this level of career development.

- Pertaining to the discussion on megatrends, she is working with a facilitator to create a workshop for the Board in early February around a concept called PEST (macro understanding of the political, economical, sociological/demographic and technological) influences over the next five years.  We hope to have experts come in to engage the Board in a level of discussion and discovery.  This is akin to the megatrends that General Manager Washington was discussing.

- General Manager Washington concluded the discussion by sharing the Board should not beat itself up over some of the things we have discussed.  This is a good Board.  As long as this Board concentrates on making good policy decision, some of the one-offs and noise should be ignored.
