Board Meeting 2
VINCE BUZEK: General Counsel?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair, Director Buzek. Sitting here today, I'm not aware of an
appellate court that has ruled on the issue of the serial communications. What I can say though is that
there is a tipping point where the point of the Open Meetings Law is that public business is done in a
public forum, and full deliberations happen in a public setting.
So at a certain point, when even if you are only having serial communications between two Directors, it
could reach that tipping point where it does not appear that-- it can appear or be in practice the actual
deliberations are all happening outside of a public meeting. And that, I think, is a pretty clear violation of
the Open Meetings Law.
I do also just want to highlight the Open Meetings Law has special provision for local governments that do
allow for two Directors or two local government officials to have these meetings. But just for context, with
respect to state entities, and there is no such exception.
So you cannot have two state officials, state public entities, members of the state public bodies. You
cannot have even two members communicating. So I will say this local government provisions under the
Open Meetings Law, it's available, but I just would caution you about pushing the boundaries too much.
DOUG TISDALE: All right, well, I appreciate that observation, and I appreciate even more the
confirmation that no one is aware of an appellate court that has ruled that serial conversations, A with B
and then B with C, constitute a violation of the Sunshine Law. I do understand that if you were to have
then conversations with C and D and then D and E and so on that, yes, you could reach that tipping point.
But I think that a court would be required under those circumstances just in terms of fair notice and First
Amendment issues that there would have to be some clear delineation of what is it that constitutes that,
particularly if it is outside the language of the statute itself. I, for other reasons, I think I have some pause
about this, and I think that the discussion relative to new Board members and even perhaps more
importantly new Board Office staff being able to weigh in on this would be beneficial.
So I think, like Director Whitmore, I haven't come to a hard conclusion yet, but I think I'm leaning toward a
no, but with the idea that we could continue to explore whether there really is a problem that we can solve
this way or whether serial conversations in fact do work. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. That's all I
have.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Tisdale. Director Davidson?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you to everybody for the discussion here. It has been
very helpful. A lot to take in. I had a question for either Director Guissinger or Director Sloan or Director
Dishell given the initiation of this action.

For me, one of the compelling points here that we're contemplating is the Board-initiated action requiring
three members. Was there any discussion or consideration given to an adjustment to the bylaws to the
extent this is feasible to lower that number to two Directors? I'm curious if there was any discussion about
that, any consideration about that, and rationale for arriving at the current solution. Thanks.
VINCE BUZEK: Any response?
LYNN GUISSINGER: None that I know of. Yeah.
MARJORIE SLOAN: And I know of none either. I should think that would be at least as major a cultural
change as including informal meetings, but that was just not a direction that we looked at. And in fact, it
only became compelling when we were working on the details of this.
And it's not just the potential legal problems with daisy chain communications. It's the absence of a meaty
discussion. It's the classic game of telephone. You lose a lot of important content if it's one Director with
another has a lengthy conversation. The gist of it is shared with another Director, you lose the potential
for a good solution.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Guissinger, do you have something else to add?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think we're just hearing the concerns and want to be responsive. I guess I would
move to continue this to a date certain that we can look at it to see-- I mean, I think one option is these
could always be zoomed to solve some of these problems. But we could look at-- we're hearing a lot of
concerns, and that would give us a chance to see if it makes sense to make some changes to address
them or not. So I am making a motion to continue this to a date certain.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. First of all, General Counsel, is this motion properly before the Board?
MELANIE SNYDER: We need a date certain suggested.
VINCE BUZEK: Which Board meeting?
MELANIE SNYDER: February.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. There's a date certain. Is there a second?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Second. And I have been convinced by the folks who said we're in transition, not just
the Board but the Board Office. And to me, that was an important consideration. So I think tabling it till
February after the Board has a chance to get at least a month of their feet on the ground would be
helpful.
VINCE BUZEK: Great. Thanks. Director Bouquet, did you have something?
JULIEN BOUQUET: I just wanted to add weight to Director Davidson's comment that I would like, if this is
going to be reevaluated, have the suggestion of changing bylaws to two Directors bring forth
recommended actions from three to two. That would be what I would add on. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, well, let's keep the discussion to this topic. Director Whitmore?

TROY WHITMORE: Just one thought. I'm not sure February is late enough in regard to moving through
with new staff and new Board. Case in point, this may be an item for a publicly noticed Board retreat
about that time That might require a little more work. So maybe the date certain would be more
appropriate to go March or April. Just a thought to the motion maker. Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I was wondering about that too, so maybe making it something for, let's just say,
April.
VINCE BUZEK: OK.
MARJORIE SLOAN: If that's a motion, I second it.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. This is Robert's Rules, not Bob's rules. So let's see, General Counsel Snyder, we
had a motion at a second to move it to a date certain of February, and now the motion maker and the
second want to move it to April. What do we need to do?
MELANIE SNYDER: I think we have enough that we have the motion maker and the seconder agreeing
on the date certain being the April meeting.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Got it. So we've got a motion and a second moving this to the April Board meeting. Is
there any discussion on this motion? OK, now I didn't get to give my two cents, so I'm going to say a
couple of things.
There was this discussion about serial communications. And one judge said it and not necessarily
violates open Meetings Law, but what it does do is it fails completely in transparency. And so when you
have this ability to have these smaller, more informal but properly noticed and in an appropriate location
and secure meetings, I think that only adds to transparency and also allows us to reach out to our
constituencies in a more meaningful fashion.
And with all due respect to the people involved, Directors Guissinger, Sloan, and Dishell, this isn't the first
time anybody's done this. This happens all the time. I mean, there are all kinds of organizations and
entities that have bylaws that say you can do this kind of thing, and it works just fine. So anyway.
So we got a motion and a second to continue this to the April Board meeting. Are there any No votes?
Seeing none, I still think we have 14. Is that right? Passes 14 to 0 with one absent. Great discussion. I
appreciate the presenters of this being willing to take the accountants to heart. Great.
Moving on to the second recommended action. It's the Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future. And I
am looking for a motion for the Board of Directors to endorse the Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the
Future, MPFF.
Consistent with the System Optimization Plan, SOP, the MPFF will be reviewed and updated with Board
approval periodically on a no less than triennial basis to provide for a consistent and effective coordinated
policy and vision for service. Do I have a motion?
DOUG TISDALE: So moved. Tisdale.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Tisdale. Second?
KATE WILLIAMS: Williams.

VINCE BUZEK: And Williams. Any discussion on this? Great. Seeing none-- oh, Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, just I think I understand this, but I'll ask-- I think I saw-- Brian Welch. Yeah,
there he is. And by endorsing still the particular plans like the Partnership Plan before it goes into effect
will be coming back to the Board for approval. Is that right? Since we're endorsing the MPFF. I see you
nodding. OK, it looks like Miss Johnson has raised her hand too.
VINCE BUZEK: Great. Miss Johnson?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you very much, Director Guissinger,
for the question. Just as clarity as we go forward, recognizing that there are several components that are
embedded in the Mobility Plan for the Future.
I want to ensure that I manage expectations, as this Board has approved funds for, say, the partnerships
and things of the like. We will be working with the Subregional Service Councils. And just as we did
previously when we worked with the working group, we will bring that information back for the Board so
they are apprised.
And so when we talk about approving per se, I want to be careful in the sense that I say we're going to
approve, but there could be different elements of that as it comes full circle, recognizing we'll work with
the subregions. But yes, we will be bringing that information back to this Board so you are aware.
Naturally as we talk about different policy aspects, we will be bringing that to the Board, so I just wanted
to be clear so nothing is misleading in reference to what we're doing collectively.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So I guess I understood it differently at the meeting the other night, but the
Partnership Program is the one I'm particularly interested in. And I'm glad it's going out to the Local
Service Councils. I guess I'd like to see it again, and you said you'd apprise. I hope it would come back to
the Board to make a final decision on that particular program.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Very well. And all I'm saying to you is, as we're going through this, we want to
engage with them just as we did when we established the subregional service councils. I'm not saying
we're not going to bring it back to the Board. But in relationship, is it an adoption? Is it a process?
Because this is operational in some aspect, but yes, there could be the policy aspect. We don't know
what that is yet until we get the feedback from them, so that's all I'm trying to provide a framework.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK, thank you. I guess I've made this comment in the committee a couple of weeks
ago, but I'll say it again. Which is, I really like the intent and the moving forward in the Partnership
Program. Brian, when you presented it before, I could hear that staff is looking forward to moving these
forward and understand that we're starting with a very small amount of money with the $2 million.
But I think speaking for myself and hopefully some of the other Board members, if we get it going,
hopefully we can find the money to expand that sooner rather than later and move it forward. Because I
think that it brings a lot of value to the agency to have the partners moving forward with us, and it brings
other money for us to continue to provide additional transit, so thanks for all your effort on it, and those
are my comments.
VINCE BUZEK: Great. Thank you, First Vice Chair. Secretary Sloan?

MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes, for tonight, Director Guissinger and I seem to be in sync. I too am really
appreciative of the program, but it sent me to the dictionary to look up endorsement and partnership
because endorsement means strongly support, and partnership, of course, means people are true
partners in that they agree on a goal and they share the risks and the benefits.
And I believe that can be fleshed out both in terms of policy and in terms of the relationship in the mobility
plan for the future. However, if you look at endorse, and since this is elections season and people were
endorsing candidates, an endorsement of a candidate just means you really support the direction of that
person. Not everything that person will take a vote on, and you might not be in agreement in the future.
So with those caveats in terms of-- I don't believe the partnership relationship is fleshed out enough in the
Mobility Plan, and that is certainly a big part of the future of RTD. But even with that reservation, I do
heartily support the concept of the Mobility Plan for the Future. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you. First Vice Chair Guissinger, do you have more?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, sorry.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Davidson?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thanks, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to touch on something briefly given some of the public
comment we've received. And also I know many Directors are thinking about what the future is going to
look like here.
And at a couple of committees now, I've highlighted that I think next year this Board really needs to take
on examining our funding structure and partnering with other agencies, municipalities, and ultimately the
state to really examine how we're funded. For those interested, I have spent some time looking at the
funding structures of other agencies, and I do think that there's a number of places that we can grow by
looking at the models of others and perhaps also lead in some areas.
So I just wanted to highlight that I think in the Mobility Plan for the Future, we've done a nice job here at
being fairly general and high level and open on the slides that touch upon what our current funding
sources allow and what the increased funding sources allow. And I do actually believe that there is some
ambition in here. For example, there's a slide that mentions the increased funding sources could result in
implementing additional bus rapid transit and increasing bus and rail capacity. There's also some things
that contemplate frequency and access.
And when we talk about wanting to increase transit funding, and when we talk about wanting to do some
of these ambitious things, it gets pretty large and overwhelming, and I think that's why not a lot has
happened. And the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time, so we need to take some of these
opportunities and be really ambitious as we find interesting opportunities for those new funding sources
and I think, engage with our partners.
At the Finance and Planning Committee, we discussed or we heard from staff in the Systemwide Fare
and Equity Analysis Study the potential for looking at free fares for use or zero fare use down the road.
Perfect example of where we would absolutely need to look for partners that are interested in engaging
and contributing additional funding.

So I think I've heard some concern, and we heard in public comment, is there enough ambition in this? I
think it's there by staying high level. I think that's what's actually really great, and I commend staff about
doing the endorsement.
And my ask for staff is that we do be very ambitious. We reengage on some of these items and that we
look for opportunities to really engage with partners to say, hey, let's look at youth fares. That's something
we can all get behind and frequency and access and bus rapid transit.
There's inspiration we can take from other models that do not depend on a monolithic sales tax that only
scales one way and does not scale properly across our 2,300 square mile district. So thank you for
allowing me the opportunity to comment, and thank you to staff for bringing forward this proposal of
endorsement.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Davidson. Any further comments? Seeing no further discussion, are
there any No votes on this proposal, recommended action? Seeing none, that passes 14 to 0.
We'll move on to the next recommended action item, which is the Federal Lobbying Contract Extension.
And I am looking for a motion for the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or
her designee to execute an amendment to exercise the option to extend the current Federal Lobbying
Services Contract with Squire Patton Boggs LLP for two additional years through and including December
31, 2024. Do I have a motion?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved, Rivera-Malpiede.
SHELLEY COOK: Second, Cook.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Any discussion? Seeing none, are there any No votes on this item? That passes 14
to 0, and thank you, Squire Patton Boggs.
Next as our 2023 Legislative Program. I need a motion for the Board of Directors to adopt the 2023
Legislative Program. Is there motion?
TROY WHITMORE: So moved, Whitmore.
VINCE BUZEK: Second? Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Getting unmuted. Second.
VINCE BUZEK: And any discussion on this? Great. Are there any No votes on this recommended action?
See none, that passes 14 to 0.
The final recommended action item is the Independent Audit Committee appointments. It is
recommended by RTD Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell that the Board of Directors appoint as
members of the Independent Audit Committee, Jim Brendel, external member to a three-year term
expiring December 31, 2025.
John Olendberger, external member, to a two-year term expiring December 31, 2024. Eric Davidson,
Board member, to a two-year term expiring December 31, 2024. And Peggy Catlin and Bobby Dishell,
Board members, each to a one-year term expiring December 31, 2023. Do I have a motion for approval of
this recommended action?

KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second, Rivera-Malpiede.
VINCE BUZEK: Any discussion? Director Davidson?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be brief. I just wanted to say thank you to the Board for the
work on this. Thank you to the Ad Hoc Committee for the work on this. And a special Thank you to
everybody who applied to join this committee from outside this Board.
We had some great candidates. We had a lot of discussion and a lot to choose from here, and I very
much appreciate the willingness to serve. This is not an easy thing to do. It is service. It is volunteer and
very, very appreciative to everybody who stepped up in the community to offer their service and looking
forward to bringing in some new colleagues for the Audit Committee. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that. Any further discussion? And thanks for the hard work of this committee
because they really did a lot and important work as well. Are there any No-- oh, sorry, Director Catlin. I'm
sorry.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to echo what Director Davidson said. We did have some
really stellar applicants from outside this agency. And I guess I would like to say that this Ad Hoc
Committee, upon seating the Audit Committee itself, this Ad Hoc Committee's work will be concluded.
And I wanted to thank my fellow Directors Dishell and Davidson for all of their hard work. And I think it's
been a long time coming, but I think that the work that we've done will bode well in the long run. Thank
you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for those comments. Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: Make no bones about it, this was one hell of a heavy lift. And I am so appreciative to
the three members of the Committee. Countless hours, their skills, their dedication, and certainly welcome
the two outside members to the committee. So rack this up as one of the major accomplishments of the
Regional Transportation District for 2022. Thank you, all.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for those comments. Any further discussion? Seeing none, are there any No
votes on this recommended action? Seeing none, that passes 14 to 0. Next, report of Director activities.
Would anyone, Director, would like to report on their activities for the month of November? Director
Tisdale, please.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First, I wanted to report that the-- excuse me, the
APTA Executive Committee conducted its retreat this last weekend, and that was an extremely productive
event with the 25 or so members of the Executive Committee representing the various agencies around
the country coming together. We had an excellent presentation by our former General Manager, Phil
Washington, regarding the Equity and Infrastructure Project.
And I would be happy to give you more information on that later. It's a very interesting and exciting project
that he is heading up that he essentially began when he was on President Biden's transition team. And
they came up with the original proposal for what they called Justice40.

The other thing that we discussed at the Executive Committee Retreat was the APTA Code of Conduct
and addressing the fact that there is an active code of conduct, and it does address certain issues that
sometimes regrettably may arise at events and meetings and functions that APTA has where there may
be incidents of harassment going on. So we have committed anew toward having special training and
information made available at all events and conferences of APTA to address that.
And then finally, today, I hosted the Board Talk Live session regarding CEO evaluations. The Transit
Board Members Committee at APTA periodically conducts what we call Board Talk Live, and that's a
gathering of Transit Board members to discuss topics of special interest.
That particular session included all of my introductory remarks and then a presentation by Caitlin Vargas,
who is the Present of the Lane Transit District Board in Eugene, Oregon regarding CEO evaluations. That
video and those materials are available to any Transit Board member.
So when I get the link for that, I will make sure that you have it. And I felt compelled to address that
particularly this evening because having been told that the deadline for submission of CEO evaluations is
Friday, now apparently some Directors seem to believe that the deadline is today. And that if we didn't get
it done today, somehow we are derelict in our duties.
I'm a lawyer. The deadline is Friday. It'll be in by Friday. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's all I have.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Director Tisdale. One thing, Director Sloan, you are not muted. Gesundheit. And
Director Williams, you're up.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you. You took the words right out of my mouth there. Since we're doing Director
reports, I want to report that I did attend the Rail-Volution Conference in Miami earlier this month. And
what I found most worthwhile for all of us was the P3 partnerships that they used to build an amazing
tunnel under the part of Biscayne Bay that took all of the truck traffic out of downtown and sent it straight
into the port, and that P3 project was funded predominantly by foreign investors.
It was a very interesting tour. I tried to hire everybody there. General Manager Johnson to tell them all
how wonderful Colorado was, and they should get out of Florida and come here.
The other thing that I did, I will be attempting to get an audience with the governor because I also took a
tour of Florida's new Brightline Train System, which is also a P3 partnership, and runs about the same
distance as the distance between Boulder and Denver. So I'm going to propose to Governor Polis that if
he needs a train that he should do the same work that they did in Florida to hook up a P3 partnership.
There are lots of investors who are really happy, and that is a very cool train. So those are the things that
I did while I was at Rail-Volution in Miami. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Williams, and good luck with that. Second Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to just state that I hopped on to the APTA Board Transit
talk this morning, or at noon today, and found that presentation to be very, very good, but also very
consistent with what RTD has done in terms of aligning strategic pillars or strategic priorities with our
evaluation process.

So that was really helpful, and I was able to listen in and I think that I was holding off on doing my GM
CEO performance evaluation until after I learned some things from that particular presentation. So it was
well worth it, those of you who are interested in seeing what Director Tisdale puts out. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Catlin, and thank you, 2021 GMOC, for hard work in changing the
performance evaluation mechanism. Director Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. And Mr. Chair, I also was privileged to attend the Rail-Volution
in Miami. And I did a tour of Little Havana, and one of the things that I learned in terms of consistency
across the country is that people are having great difficulty hiring bus drivers and staff, and the rents are
going up exponentially in Little Havana. They've gone up 1,000%, and they were in both a food desert
and a transit desert.
But the city did go ahead and build a huge, brand-new soccer stadium because Cubans like to play
soccer. So it was very interesting to me, the dynamics in terms of culture, and that the governor had
taken the homeless and put them all on one beach. So I thought that was also very, very interesting in
terms of how they're dealing with the dynamics of the changing environment there.
We were there during the big election. It was very apparent that everybody was doing their thing. And it
was also very interesting to see how Latinos were thinking in terms of election outcomes and what their
voice would sound like. We were able to really network with a variety of folks from Canada to Mali, from
the Downtown Streets Partnership, to Chris Nevitt from the City of Denver, and meeting new people and
talking about new ideas and ways to move forward.
So I thought it was a great conference. I learned a lot. I came back with a lot of networking opportunities
and the ability to start partnering together. But clearly, we are all in this together in terms of, across the
country, the issues are the same, the unhoused, the lack of bus drivers and the staff to support that, and
the rising rents. So thank you, Mr. Chairman.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Rivera-Malpiede. Any other reports of Director activities? Seeing
none, we'll move on to other matters. Are there other matters to come before the Board? Ms. McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. Thank you, Chair, for recognizing me. I, like some of the Directors that are
rolling off the Board, this is my last meeting of business for RTD in almost 12 years. And I would like to
recognize my staff, past, present and future, for all of the success. I could not have been successful
without them in supporting you and making the Board successful.
So I want to thank my current staff, Tai-Shrae Parrish, Jillian Knapp-Rhodes, Marie Snell, and my past
staff, Aaron Viejos, John MacKay, Vivian Morales and Nicole Carey, who have all moved forward in this
agency to be successful employees. Thank you for my comments.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you very much. Thanks for that. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Thank you, Chair. I was just going to ask the Board Office to send me another copy of the
performance evaluation form so it will remind me to get it in Friday.
VINCE BUZEK: I'm sure they'll accommodate that. Thanks, Director Broom. Just a couple of closing
comments. 2022 was a unique year for the Board. In November 2021, the Board approved changes to
our meeting structure and cadence, and for the first time in 2022, the Board officially had no regularly
scheduled meetings for the months of August and December.

Because this is the last regularly scheduled Board meeting for the year, the traditional end-of-term
proclamations for outgoing Directors will be recognized at a later date. The Board Office has been in
contact with the Secretary of State's Office, and election certifications will not occur until the week of
December 5th.
As that date is after our regular meeting schedule, proclamations for Directors Cook, Lewis and RiveraMalpiede will be during the special Board meeting on January 10. And don't miss it. It'll be fun. And as this
is my last regularly scheduled Board meeting for the year, thanks to my Executive Committee for all their
hard work, dedication, and support, and thank you, Directors, for your constant dedication to the cause,
your discussion on every item that comes before us. You've been great to work with.
In a minute, we're going to move into executive session. We're going to come back out of that just to
adjourn. So we're going to move into executive session to receive legal advice regarding the September
21-22 R-Line derailment. Please note that the Board will reconvene in open session after the Executive
session ends with no further business on the Board meeting agenda.
I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session pursuant to Section 24-66-4024(b) CRS to
receive legal advice and Section 246-4024(c) CRS, Matters Required to Be Kept Confidential by State
Law and Rules, Section 40-18-104 CRS, and CCR 723-7, Public Utilities Commission Rules, 7349(d)(i)
and Roman I and Roman IV, Confidentiality of Light Rail Vehicle Accident Investigations, regarding the
September 21-22 R line derailment. Don't ask me to repeat that. Do I have a motion?
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Who was the second?
PEGGY CATLIN: Catlin.
VINCE BUZEK: Catlin. So Williams and Catlin. And Director Rosenthal, you had your hand up. Do you
have something for me?
PAUL ROSENTHAL: Can we just take a short break to take a short break?
VINCE BUZEK: We're going to reconvene-- move over to executive session now, but we're not going to
start that for 10 minutes. 7:50. 7-5-0 we'll start.
MELANIE SNYDER: Chair, can we get a vote on that?
VINCE BUZEK: Oh.
MELANIE SNYDER: A vote on the motion.
VINCE BUZEK: Nah. Any discussion on the motion? Any no votes on the motion? That passes 14-KATE WILLIAMS: Hey. One second. I'm about to enter a break here.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, Director Williams. 14 to 0, that passes. Thanks, General Counsel, for the reminder.
And we'll see you in executive session, and we'll start at 7-5-0 PM.
