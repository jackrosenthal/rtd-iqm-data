BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body
by October 15, 2013. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2014
Requested Budget for public review on October 13, 2013. A public hearing to solicit formal
public comment is scheduled for the November 26, 2013 regular meeting of the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2014 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $1,726.4 million. This includes an operating budget of $529.5 million
including interest expense of $99.4 million, capitalized interest of $45.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $870.3 million, debt payments of $61.5 million, FasTracks contingency reserve
of $30.0 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $21.4 million, Board appropriated fund
of $26.5 million, capital replacement fund of $19.3 million, and estimated unrestricted fund
balance of $23.4 million. The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,063.2
million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,789.6 million.
Overview of the 2014 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues on a combined basis of $996.5 million are expected to increase $43.3 million (4.5%)
in 2014 over the 2013 Amended Budget. The increase is composed primarily of increases in
fare revenue of $5.6 million and sales/use tax revenue of $37.4 million, offset by a small
decrease in grant revenue of $3.8 million.
Total Base System grants are projected to decrease by $3.9 million, including new and carry
forward amounts. Drawdowns on Base System grants totaled $85.0 million in 2013; new grant

Packet Pg. 17

2.11.A

funding of $81.1 million is projected for 2014. FasTracks grants will essentially remain flat from
2013 due to same level of FFGA funding for the Eagle project, increases in corridor grants for
the US 36 project and the Downtown Circulator, and carry forward funding for the West Line.
Farebox revenues are budgeted to increase $5.6 million or 4.7% based on 2.8% growth in
ridership coupled with a full year of West Line operations in 2014. Sales and use tax revenues
are expected to increase 5.9% over the 2013 projected level according to the most recent
September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Operating expenditures on a combined basis will be down by $25.2 million overall in 2014 from
the 2013 Amended Budget. The decrease is largely due to: 1) completion of FasTracks projects,
2) higher capitalization of FasTracks project salaries, 3) decline in contract maintenance in
FasTracks due to project completion, carryforward, or expense/capital transfers, and 4) reduction
of $11.0 million for a one-time 2013 DUS contribution, offset by: 5) full-year of West Line
operations, and 6) expense projects carry-forward from 2013 totaling $14.1 million. The
expense project carryforward to 2014 is $12.2 million for Base operations and $1.9 million for
FasTracks.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.26 per gallon, which is the same price that was locked in 2013 for
no incremental change. Gasoline is budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was
budgeted in 2013 for no incremental change.
The major changes in operating expense comparing the Recommended Budget to the previous
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget are the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2014 is budgeted at $99.4 million which is an increase of $19.9 million over
the 2013 Amended Budget. Of the interest expense amount, Base system interest will decrease
$3.0 million due to full year impact of refundings of existing debt at lower interest rates
completed in 2013 offset by new COPs issued in 2013. FasTracks interest expense will
increase $22.9 million due to full-year payments on the I-225 corridor revenue bonds and
estimates for interest expense on new debt issued (see Principal payments below). Capitalized
interest (combined) will increase by $3.9 million to $45.0 million due to continuing completion of
FasTracks construction. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest
payments in 2014.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $61.5 million. This is an increase of $15.0 million
over the 2013 Amended Budget due to 1) issuance in the second half of 2013 of FasTracks
revenue bonds for I-225 expansion and Base System COPs for fleet purchases and 2) issuance of
new debt in 2014. Debt proceeds of $720 million are anticipated in 2014 from new debt for
FasTracks consisting of $400 million in revenue bonds for the North Metro rail line, $240 million
in GARVEE interim debt, and $80 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project construction.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2013 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2014. The
capital carry-forward will be $1,063.2 million made up of $181.0 million on the Base System
and $882.1 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis will increase $103.0 million from the 2013 Amended
Budget due mainly to project construction in FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will

Packet Pg. 18

2.11.A

increase $129.9 million to $773.1 million in 2014 due to project construction on I-225, North
Metro, and the Eagle project. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $26.9
million to $97.2 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $10.3 million less in capital
support projects in IT, security, and operations, $19.8 million less on fleet
modernization/expansion, and $6.6 million less on capital support equipment including reductions
in vehicles and maintenance equipment and 16th Street Mall repair local dollars. These
reductions will be offset by $4.8 million more on park-n-ride projects primarily Stapleton, $5.1
million more on LRT transit projects including crossover work, track maintenance equipment,
event recorders, and ADA highblock replacement, and $0.4 million on DUS bus box emergency
barriers.
New capital expenditures for 2014 and the change in new capital in the 2014 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2014 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2014 and the change in the capital
carry-forward in the 2014 Recommended Budget over the 2013 Amended Budget are shown in
Attachment C.
Notable designated reserve fund changes include an increase over the 2013 Amended Budget in
the Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance, which is projected to increase $3.7 million
to $18.1 million in line with the SBP. Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is
projected to increase by $5.0 million to $21.2 million, and the capital replacement fund is
projected to increase by $5.0 million to $14.0 million. While the SBP targets called for an
increase of $3.0 million in each fund, it is proposed that the contribution be raised to $5.0
million to each fund in 2014 due to the additional dollars generated from the higher sales and use
tax forecast.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to remain essentially flat at
$23.4 million. The $3.7 million increase in the Base System’s unrestricted fund balance is offset
by a decrease of $3.3 million on the FasTracks side from the reduction in fund balance from
three months of operating expenses to two months. Both the Board-appropriated fund and the
capital replacement fund on a District-wide basis are projected to increase by $1.7 million each.
These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities
(Base System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve is budgeted to decrease $59.4 million in 2014 from the
2013 Amended Budget as a result of the accrual of DTP (Denver Transit Partners) finance
charges and the use of funds for construction purposes. FasTracks contributed capital of $49.8
million, consisting of concessionaire contributed capital and third-party betterments on the Eagle
construction project, will decrease $52.4 million due to DUS project completion in spring 2014.
The 2014 budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a
balance of $30 million.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2014 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Packet Pg. 19

2.11.A

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2014 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is
for the total of these three funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses
excluding depreciation for the Base System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2014
budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30
million. This reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2014 is projected at $69.3 million on a Districtwide basis, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $26.5 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $19.3 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining
fund balance of $23.4 million. The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2014 is
projected to total $53.3 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:



Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2014 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2014 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2014 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2014 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2014 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2013. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2013, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and maintenance
purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 31, 2013

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 30, 2013

Board Meeting Date: November 21, 2013

Subject:

Approval of Tenth Year (2014) Contract
Amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
FasTracks Program Support Consulting

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the tenth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the
amount of $23,462,562 for Program Support Services Consulting (PSC) for FasTracks for the year
2014. Funds for the award are contained in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks
capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an
initial 2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. - Subsequent
contract amendments approved by the RTD Board, along with contract adjustments to reconcile the
contract approvals to actual billings, have brought the current Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to
$127,520,164. The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2014 with this contract
amendment would be $150,982,726.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to
augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the
RTD FasTracks offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value,
cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on
an as-needed, often part-time, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction,
the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has changed,
and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This flexibility
allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program, without

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option,
to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The option was approved by the RTD
Board in November 2011.The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to ensure that
specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a
number of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:






Areas of specialized expertise or experience.
Part-time assignments.
Shorter duration efforts.
Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.
Limit the number of RTD positions that may need to be re-assigned when current projects are
completed.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is
actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2014 include the following:





Construction of the Eagle P3 project.
Integrated testing and startup of the DUS project.
Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.
Final design and construction of I-225.

During 2014, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:

RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
cumulative DBE percentage through year-end 2013 will be 18.5%. For 2014, the PSC has committed to
23.9% DBE participation, well in excess of the 7% goal, which would bring the projected DBE
percentage through year-end 2014 to 19.4%. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2014 would be
$150,982,726 with this amendment. Funds for the 2014 contract award in the amount of
$23,462,562 are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year
contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $23,462,562 for Program Support
Services Consulting (PSC) for FasTracks for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in
the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where
PSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in -house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient
level of expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in
the Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed
basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is
not recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing
valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTrack s Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of Contract Amendment to Front
Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) for
FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks monitoring committee that the Board of Directors approve a
Contract Amendment with Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the amount of $10,566,646 for
the year 2014, bringing the total contract authorization to $64,309,557. Funds for the contract award
are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where FRSC support would be utilized.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2012
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:







Provided construction management support for the West Corridor Project
Provided Systems Engineering & Construction Management Support on the Eagle Project
Provided construction management support on the Substation Programmable Logic Controller
Upgrade Project
Completed the design documents for the I225 Project Provided Systems Engineering Support on
the On-Call Systems Engineering Contract
Provided construction management support for the Denver Union Station Project
Provided Systems Engineering Support for the North Metro Project

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach will save the RTD cost and will facilitate the
operation and maintenance of the system. The initial contract award was for the final design services
for the West Corridor and evaluation of commuter rail vehicle type. The work effort is consistent with
the work required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule. In particular,
FRSC will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing SE Extension, DUS, I-225, North
Metro, and Eagle Projects. The agreed upon Scope of Work for the Contract Amendment and associated

successfully concluded the negotiations with a contract price of $10,566,646 for the work to be
completed in 2014.
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 15.7% DBE goal. Front
Range Systems Consultants has proposed a 15.4% DBE goal for the 2014 work, exceeding the RTD
proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the 2014 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program.

2014 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the second one-year option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as
the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the
period of performance through 2014. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the
Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD.
This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $487,308.80 for the year 2014. Funds for
the award are contained in the 2014 FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications a nd
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or embellished from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work effort in January 2012 and put forth an extensive effort to become oriented

certified SBE.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this second one-year option are included in the 2014 FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the second one -year
option to the Virtegic Group Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications
and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2014. The scope of
work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually
by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount
not to exceed $487,308.80 for the year 2014. Funds for the award are contained in the 2014
FasTracks Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program. This alternative would delay and negatively impact the effective
implementation of the FasTracks Public Information Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
second one-year option to Virtegic Group. Issue another Request for Proposals for professional
services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach for the FasTracks Program
and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not recommended as the Virtegic team
is satisfactorily performing its work, and this alternative will delay and negatively impact the
successful implementation of the various strategies and activities associated with a
comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort.

Subject:

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Commerce
City

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City of Commerce
City (C3) and the Regional Transportation District. The agreement includes specific terms defining C3’s
local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and responsibilities of each party within the
Commerce City boundaries.
BACKGROUND
As part of the FasTracks Plan, RTD proposes to construct the North Metro Rail Line, consisting of
electric commuter rail transit connecting Denver Union Station with Adams County, the City and County
of Denver, the City of Thornton, the City of Northglenn, and the City of Commerce City, identified in the
FasTracks Plan and more fully described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Project
dated January 2011 as approved by the Record of Decision for the Project signed by the Federal Transit
Administration on April 22, 2011 and the final design plans.
The FasTracks Financial Plan assumes and requires a two and one-half percent (2.5%) local agency
contribution from local jurisdictions in the RTD district in consideration for the construction of transit
improvements that will benefit the City and its citizens and the other governmental entities along the
NMRL.
DISCUSSION
This IGA between C3 and RTD establishes the local agency contribution amount for C3 and how that
local agency contribution will be met. The IGA sets forth the commitments from RTD and C3 regarding
financial obligations, responsibilities, coordination, and cooperation between both agencies with respect
to the North Metro Rail Line within the City’s boundaries.
Local Agency contribution
The total local agency contribution shall not exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the cost of the
Project. The cost of the Project for the purposes of establishing the local agency contribution is Nine
Hundred and Nine Million Dollars ($909,000,000) in year of expenditure dollars. Therefore, the total
local agency contribution is Twenty-Two Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($22,725,000), to be shared by and between by Adams County, the City and County of Denver, and the
Cities of Thornton, Northglenn, and Commerce City and, accordingly, the City’s local agency
contribution is Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,700,000).
The IGA stipulates that the $4.7M will be covered by one or more of the following:
1. A lump sum cash payment.
2. Annual cash payments.
3. The value of project permits and fees for plan review.

Packet Pg. 62

2.12.G

4. The value of City staff time required to perform necessary activities associated with planning,
design, construction and inspection of the Project.
5. The value of utility relocation credits due to the City if relocation of public utilities is necessitated
by construction of the Project.
6. The fair market value of real property interests owned or controlled by the C3 that are identified
by RTD and the C3 as required to implement and operate the Project and granted or conveyed to
RTD by the C3. The value of customary fees including storm water utility fees and water tap fees
and sales/use taxes that are legally required to be paid by RTD or the contractors that may be
rebated by the City.
7. The cost of mutually agreed construction projects that are necessary for the NMRL from funding
sources secured by the City (exclusive of Betterments).
Commerce City shall complete the Local Agency Contribution to RTD no later than the first day of NMRL
commuter rail revenue service to the 72nd Avenue Station.
Additional items included in the IGA include:
 Permitting, design plan review, construction review and inspection processes.
 Utility relocation responsibilities and processes.
 Design criteria requirements and design review responsibilities are identified including, but not
limited to, transit system elements, storm sewer, water quality, parking and traffic mitigation,
quiet zones, and station aesthetics.
 RTD will design and construct emergency access on the north side of the 72 nd Avenue station
park-n-Ride so as to not preclude future vehicular public access to the station. Any
improvements to 72 nd Avenue, including bridge replacement for signalization will not be the
responsibility of RTD.
 Process for project betterment determination and funding.
 RTD will petition to annex RTD property into the City of Commerce City.
Summary
IGAs are required with the City of Commerce City, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro
corridor, in order to define the respective rights and responsibilities of each party, and to define the local
agency share credit. The recommendation is to authorize the General Manager to execute this agreement
defining those rights and responsibilities of RTD and Commerce City with respect to the North Metro Rail
Line project. The signed IGA defines coordination between RTD and the City of Commerce City for the
North Metro project and demonstrates that right-of-way and other coordination responsibilities have been
defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line project.
The $4.7 million local agency contribution is a part of the project financial plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the City of Commerce City (C3) and the Regional Transportation District.
The agreement includes specific terms defining C3’s local agency contribution, coordination, and the
rights and responsibilities of each party within the Commerce City boundaries.

Packet Pg. 63

2.12.G

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This could cause delays in project implementation as well
as budget impacts of $4.7M. In addition, an IGA is required to provide for FasTracks-required local
match determination, property acquisitions from C3 needed for the project, and responsibilities and
coordination. This action is not recommended.

North Metro Rail Line Intergovernmental
Agreement
(IGA)
with
the
Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD). The agreement
includes specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and RTD and the rights and
responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the North Metro Rail Line especially
regarding interface with the state highway system.
BACKGROUND
As part of the FasTracks Plan, RTD proposes to construct the North Metro Rail Line, consisting of
electric commuter rail transit connecting Denver Union Station with Adams County, the City and County
of Denver, the City of Commerce City, the City of Thornton, and the City of Northglenn, identified in the
FasTracks Plan and more fully described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Project
dated January 2011 as approved by the Record of Decision for the Project signed by the Federal Transit
Administration on April 22, 2011 and the final design plans.
The Parties have previously executed a Master Intergovernmental Agreement dated April 20, 2004 (the
"Master IGA") which addresses the need for CDOT and RTD to cooperate and coordinate regarding the
design, funding and construction of improvements to major transportation corridors that are a part of
RTD's FasTracks mass transit program so as to enhance all modes of transportation in those major
transportation corridors. Pursuant to the Master IGA, the Parties have committed to execute specific
intergovernmental agreements for each major transportation corridor that is part of RTD's FasTracks
program. The intergovernmental agreements for each major transportation corridor are intended to
address impacts of RTD's FasTracks mass transit improvements on existing or planned CDOT highway
improvements within each corridor. The specific IGAs for each corridor must address:
o physical, operational, safety, regulatory, and design impacts of RTD's transit facilities on
existing or proposed CDOT highway facilities in the major transportation corridor;
o design and construction management staff for each of the Parties that also identifies
responsibilities for overseeing the design and construction of improvements in the major
transportation corridor;
o terms and conditions upon which RTD utilizes existing CDOT-owned rights-of-way for its
mass transit improvements; and
o funding obligations and adjustments among the Parties for improvements being
constructed that affect the parties proposed or future planned transportation
improvements.
This IGA is one of the corridor specific agreements contemplated by the Master IGA and sets forth the
rights, duties and responsibilities of the Parties with respect to the design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of the Project and the crossings of, and impacts to, CDOT facilities and property.

Packet Pg. 71

2.12.J

DISCUSSION
The planned alignment for the North Metro Corridor is adjacent to, and in some cases within, CDOTowned right of way within the state highway system (“CDOT ROW”). The alignment crosses under
Interstate Highway 70, runs alongside Brighton Boulevard (State Highway 265), and crosses Interstate
Highway 270, Interstate Highway 76, 74th Avenue (State Highway 224), and 160th Avenue (State
Highway 7) (collectively, the “Interstate Crossings” or the “Crossings”). If CDOT is satisfied that the
Crossings will not impair the function, operation or safety of CDOT facilities, CDOT may request
authorization from the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”) for RTD to use the Interstate
Crossings and will itself authorize use of the other Crossings. RTD acknowledges that 23 C.F.R. Part
810, Subpart C requires CDOT to obtain authorization from the FHWA to allow RTD to use CDOT ROW
at the Crossings, and that such FHWA authorization is premised upon CDOT’s determination that RTD’s
proposed use will not impair the safety of highway users or future proposed or planned highway
improvements identified in the 2035 RTP. If RTD facilities or operations are expanded beyond what is
identified in the EIS, RTD will be responsible for additional analysis, and may be responsible for
additional improvements or mitigations and additional approvals as a result. Once RTD satisfies CDOT’s
concerns, CDOT will seek FHWA authorization for any additional use of CDOT ROW. Upon receipt of
such authorization, CDOT will promptly notify RTD that the Crossings may be utilized for construction,
operation, ownership, and maintenance of the Project.
The Project alignment for the Corridor includes screening on the Interstate Highway 70, Interstate
Highway 76, and State Highway 224 bridges to protect against contact with commuter rail electrified
elements, and crash walls at Interstate Highway 76, which have been constructed as part of a previous
project. Crash walls will also be required at SH 224 if and when the Project in this area includes double
tracking. Based on final design, additional screening or crash walls may be required along the project
limits pursuant to CDOT design standards and may require FHWA authorization.
Other items included in this IGA include but are not limited to:
o The contractors’ responsibility to remain within the identified project envelope and the
contractors’ responsibility to coordinate with CDOT and comply with all regulations if a variance
is requested;
o The responsibility and obligation for CDOT and RTD representatives and contractors to coordinate
and cooperate on all design and construction elements where CDOT properties are affected;
o The responsibility and obligation for all parties to follow federal and state laws and regulations
regarding upgrading of existing CDOT facilities to new standards;
o The rights and responsibilities of the parties regarding CDOT right-of-way, and permanent and
temporary access agreements;
o CDOT’s responsibility for funding discretionary changes requested by them;
o Roles and responsibilities for CDOT design review, construction inspection, auditing, permits,
construction management;
o CDOT staff required to review all plans and specifications related to state highway impacts
through final design and construction and related financial responsibility;
o RTD’s responsibilities regarding a safety and security management plan and public information
plan;
o Roles and responsibilities for following CDOT design criteria regarding CDOT facilities and process
for final inspection and acceptance of CDOT permitted project elements;
o The roles and responsibilities of the parties regarding operations, maintenance, bridge inspections,
insurance and following the statewide contract management system.

Summary
IGAs are required with the CDOT, as with other jurisdictions along the North Metro corridor, in order to
define the respective rights and responsibilities of each party. The recommendation is to authorize the
General Manager to sign and execute this agreement defining those rights and responsibilities of RTD
and CDOT with respect to the North Metro Rail Line project. The signed IGA defines coordination
between RTD and CDOT for the North Metro project and demonstrates that right-of-way and other
coordination responsibilities have been defined.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial elements of the IGA are funded in the project budget for the North Metro Rail Line project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Regional
Transportation District (RTD). The agreement includes specific terms defining the coordination
between CDOT and RTD and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with the
construction of the North Metro Rail Line especially regarding interface with the state highway
system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This could cause delays in project implementation. In
addition, an IGA is required to provide for property acquisitions from CDOT needed for the project,
and responsibilities and coordination. This action is not recommended.

Federal Liaison Services Contract Renewal

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement (for federal liaison services) with Patton Boggs
LLP to exercise a one-year option (February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015) to extend Contract No.
19-DX-001, at a cost of $258,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2014 budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on October 20, 2009. Eight
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a Board Ad Hoc Committee and
subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on December 10, 2009. The Executive
Committee unanimously recommended that Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract which
provided for a one-year base price with four one-year option periods. The referenced extension
covers the period from February 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015, and is the fourth and final option in
this contract. In addition to constant monitoring of Congressional and Executive Branch activities,
status reports are issued and special reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or
the General Manager. Annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of Directors are also held.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other
key Congressional committee members. When RTD has a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in
place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations process requires intense attention
to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget process.
The current transportation funding bill, MAP-21, went into effect on October 1, 2012. The
regulations and rules for implementing this funding bill are still being drafted and implemented.
Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to the contents of the bill and monitoring the
rule-making process. As drafts are circulated, special attention must be paid to the impacts to RTD.
With the buildout of FasTracks, the lobbyists will monitor discussions regarding the new funding bill
and will be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new corridors and potential
grant opportunities.
In addition, as the US Department of Transportation offers more discretionary grant opportunities,
extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional delegation, as well as Executive Branch staff,
are required, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit Administration and the
Federal Railroad Administration). The federal lobbyist group provides guidance and assistance in
applying for and receiving these federal funds from the Department of Transportation and other
agency grants for which RTD qualifies as an applicant.
The annual cost for this fourth year option is $258,000.

2.12.K

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a one-year
option (February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015) with Patton Boggs LLP.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability in
liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because the RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement.

Local Government Liaison Services Contract
Renewal

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates,
Inc. (CRL) to exercise a one-year option (January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014) to extend
Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $116,496. Funding for this contract is included in the 2014
budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the period from January 1, 2014, to December 31,
2014, and is the second option in this contract. CRL will also provide Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) liaison services. The Government Relations Committee will make future annual recommendations
to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option
periods.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this one-year contract award ($116,496) are included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks program.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement to exercise
a one-year option for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (January 1,
2014 through December 31, 2014).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into an
agreement to exercise a one-year option for the Local Government Liaison services. A new
Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new Local Government Liaison
firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been
very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters in the past, and this group is very
familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

Resolution NO. ______
Series of 2013

SUPPORT OF LAKEWOOD MASTER DEVELOPER SOLICITATION FOR FEDERAL
CENTER TOD PILOT
Whereas, the RTD Board adopted a revised Strategic Plan for TOD in 2010 that supports the creation of transit
oriented communities to increase ridership, enhance the rider experience and support the creation of livable communities;
and
Whereas, RTD established the TOD Pilot Program in 2010, which includes the Federal Center Station, to proactively
pursue the development of transit oriented communities; and
Whereas, in 2012, RTD established TOD Design Criteria to implement transit oriented communities by promoting the
integration of development and transit through specific design solutions; and
Whereas, RTD, the General Services Administration (GSA), and the City of Lakewood (Lakewood) have been
working cooperatively since 2010 to develop a coordinated approach to development on RTD and GSA land at the
Federal Center; and
Whereas, RTD owns two parcels at the Federal Center station that can assist in realizing a transit-oriented community
together with the GSA parcel.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
RTD supports a comprehensive and coordinated approach to development of both GSA and RTD land near the station
to implement RTD’s and Lakewood’s collective vision for a transit oriented community.
RTD supports the release of a developer solicitation by Lakewood to select a master developer to implement the
vision for a transit oriented community at the Federal Center station on both RTD and GSA properties.
RTD supports reconfiguring its property, consolidating parking, and if excess property results disposing of excess
property and reinvesting the value of RTD’s property at the Federal Center Station (subject to FTA approval) into station
supportive infrastructure such as structured parking and pedestrian access improvements.
RTD supports the pursuit of regional, state, and federal grant funds to help implement the vision for a transit oriented
community at the Federal Center.
The RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and his designees to negotiate with the GSA, Lakewood
and potential developers regarding RTD participation in a transit oriented community at the Federal Center and to present
to the board for approval proposal(s) regarding the transfer, lease or other encumbrance of RTD property in furtherance of
such development.

Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on the 26th day of
November, 2013.

Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option
- Farnsworth Group

Assistant

Date: October 30, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 21, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a two-year
contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing boundary mapping contract through
2015 in an amount not to exceed $70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 for 2015 which would make the total
contract amount, including past year amounts, $438,700.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Farnsworth Group in late 2009 following a competitive bid of 5 submitted
proposals. Farnsworth provides RTD with boundary mapping services. These services include tracking
annexations by jurisdictions along the District’s boundaries, and the corresponding changes to the
respective Director Districts, as well as ensuring RTD is up to date with the appropriate precinct rolls by
county for each Director District.
The contract included five option years; this requested action would be to exercise the fourth and fifthyear options. The Contract Not-To-Exceed amount for 2014 is $70,900 and for 2015 it is $72,700 for a
total of $143,600 for the two-year period.
DISCUSSION
The contract support is critical to RTD so that staff is able to maintain an accurate, up-to-date boundary
map which allows RTD to determine which residents and businesses are in or out of the District thereby
assuring accurate RTD’s sales tax collections. Also, the boundary map is used to determine who should
be awarded in-District parking privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates.
Additionally, counties within the District often modify precinct boundaries. It is imperative for RTD to
have the most up-to-date precinct boundaries whenever a general or special election is required so that
RTD can certify the precinct list for the respective Director District.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District to exercise the option from Farnsworth Group is for an amount not to exceed
$70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 in 2015 for a total of $143,600 over the two-year period. Sufficient
funding has been included in the Planning 2014 expense budget for the 2014. Funding for 2015 will be
included in the Planning 2015 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute
all documents necessary to exercise a two-year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an
extension of the existing boundary mapping contract through 2015 in an amount not to exceed

Packet Pg. 81

2.12.N

$70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 for 2015 which would make the total contract amount, including
past year amounts, $438,700.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the option to extend the contract with
Farnsworth Group. This action is not recommended for the following reasons:
i.
RTD will not be able to determine when annexations have occurred by local jurisdictions
along the District boundary and will thereby lose sales taxes generated in newly annexed
areas; and
ii.
RTD will not be able to accurately determine who should be awarded in-District parking
privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates; and
iii.
RTD will not have an accurate list of County precincts and will not be able to certify
precinct lists for Director Districts for regularly scheduled or special elections thereby
compromising the election process.

Award Contract to Purchase Video Event
Recorders for Bus Safe Driving Management

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award the contract to SmartDrive Systems of San
Diego, CA, for the purchase of up to 600 event recorder systems and five (5) years of managed services
to host and review data, provide event management in web application and produce driving behavior
reports to allow coaching of drivers on safe driving and accident reduction.
BACKGROUND
The safe driving management system is made up of onboard recording equipment and back office data
review and evaluation. The onboard equipment consists of an event recorder mounted on the bus
windshield with outward and inward facing cameras controlled by an onboard computer. The system
records video, audio, GPS location, speed, and accelerations in all three axes. The system saves data 15
seconds before and 15 seconds after an event. An event is triggered either automatically by preset
parameters, like g-forces being out of normal range signifying an impact or unusual maneuver of some
sort, or by the driver manually initiating the recording. Data for these events are uploaded to the service
provider each night and reviewed for the cause and severity of the event. The information is filtered,
prioritized and then fed back to RTD to enable effective coaching with the drivers.
Driver coaching based on data from video-based data recorders has been shown to reduce risky driving
behaviors. Poor behaviors can be addressed and good behaviors reinforced. The coaching process to
reduce poor driving behaviors will result in fewer accidents, more comfortable rides, and safer buses. In
addition, the system has been shown to provide objective data to document the cause of accidents for
reducing false claims.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on June 11, 2013 for the procurement of a Video-Based
Fleet Safety Management Solution.

DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from two (2) companies: SmartDrive Systems and DriveCam. The proposals
were rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability. SmartDrive was the lowest
cost proposal. It also showed compliance with RTD's technical requirements, to include the provisions
for connecting systems to our onboard mobile router for data transfer to WIFI cloud available in each of
the bus garages, and interfacing with RTD's new CAD/AVL system to retrieve driver assignment data.
DriveCam's system is lacking the WIFI transfer. It uses a cellular connection for data transfer, which
requires recurring cellular phone fees and contributes to their higher proposed cost. In addition, their
proposal did not detail how they would document driver bus assignments.

RTD has used two approaches to reduce the cost of this system. First, RTD requires the integration
with the existing onboard mobile router for daily data transfer via WIFI cloud, thus eliminating recurring
cellular fees. Second, RTD will use in-house personnel for the equipment installations.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

This contract is for the purchase of up to 600 sets of onboard equipment and five years of managed
services to host and review event data, manage the events in a web application, and provide reports and
program reviews. The funding for the equipment purchase is approved and available in the District's
2013 Adopted Budget. Funding for year one is included in the District's 2014 Proposed Budget and the
following years will be included on an ongoing basis. Total not to exceed costs are $268,055 for the
equipment and $201,600 per year for five (5) years of managed services.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to SmartDrive Systems for the purchase of up

2. Award the contract to the DriveCam, the second high rated proposal. This is not the recommended
action as it would contradict with RTD's procurement practice.
3. Do not authorize the award of the contract. This is not desirable as it would not provide the expected
safety benefit to our drivers, passengers and communities.
4. Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would

Award of Access-a-Ride Services Contracts

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts for the provision of Access-aRide services using dedicated (RTD owned) vehicles with MV Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, and
Via Mobility Services. These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a 5-year, with
a cumulative not-to-exceed cost of $145,700,972 for Access-a-Ride service and $28,125,117 for
Access-a-Ride fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $173,826,089. The contract amounts by
service provider are as follows: MV Transportation - $66,279,862 for service, $14,062,559 for fuel,
for a total not-to-exceed amount of $80,342,421; Horizon Coach Lines - $42,484,584 for service,
$7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $49,515,863; and Via Mobility Services $36,936,526 for service, $7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $43,967,805. The
committee further recommends that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his
designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride services with non-dedicated
(contractor provided) vehicles with Veolia Transportation on Demand. This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total 5-year, not-to-exceed amount of $9,811,727. Fuel for this
contract is included in the total contract price. These proposals represent the most responsive and
responsible proposals received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-035, to provide
Access-a-Ride Services.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transit Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center Contractor and four Service Provider
Contractors. First Transit operates the Call Center while Global Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines,
MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services provide the service. In addition, all paratransit eligibility
functions are handled under contract with Easter Seals of Colorado. The current Access-a-Ride service
provider contracts are currently scheduled to expire December 31, 2013.
On August 16, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Proposers had the option of bidding on 50%, 25%,
or 16.6% of the Access-a-Ride service and up to two packages of Call-n-Ride service. This service
represents the re-bid of service currently provided by Global Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, MV
Transportation, and Via Mobility Services. The RFP was available on the RTD external website for public

Packet Pg. 86

2.12.P

download. In addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on
September 20, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Twelve (12) proposals were received in response to RFP 13-DH-035 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride
services. Proposals were received from Apple Bus Company, First Transit, Global Transportation, Horizon
Coach Lines, McDonald Transit Associates, MV Transportation, Ride Right, SCR Medical Transportation,
Trinity Transit, Veolia Transportation and Veolia Transportation on Demand (separate proposals for both
dedicated and non-dedicated vehicle service), and Via Mobility Services (formerly known as Special
Transit).
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 13-DH-035, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride service provision to MV
Transportation (50% of the revenue hours), Horizon Coach Lines (25% of the revenue hours), and Via
Mobility Services (25% of the revenue hours). This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the
proposals according to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The
evaluative criteria established for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines
(25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).
The evaluation team consisted of Larry Buter, Manager, Paratransit Services; Maria Christian,
Technician, Contracted Services; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Kenn
Hardin, Senior Manager, Civil Rights; Pat Heye, Senior Alternative Service Planner / Scheduler; Brian
Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety and Training Compliance Officer;
Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor; and Mac Weeden, Senior Quality Control Inspector.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
twelve proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach”
and for “Experience and Proposed Key Positions.” “SBE Submittal and Compliance” was evaluated and
scored by the Civil Rights Division. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated
by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and the SBE score of each
proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal.
The key strengths of each proposal are as follows:
Apple Bus Company – previous experience with a similar sized system.
First Transit – previous experience, proposed installation of DriveCam system, comprehensive training
and maintenance program.
Global Transportation – incumbent, good training program, no start up.
Horizon Coach Lines – incumbent, good maintenance program, no start up.
McDonald Transit Associates – good maintenance program and quality control systems.
MV Transportation – incumbent, proposed new technologies to monitor service, good maintenance and
training program.
Ride Right – previous experience with a similar sized system.
SCR Medical Transportation – previous experience, good training and quality control systems.
Trinity Transit – previous experience with Access-a-Ride Project Management.

Packet Pg. 87

2.12.P

Veolia Transportation (dedicated vehicle) – previous experience, good maintenance plan, good training
program.
Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated vehicle) – existing provider, limited start up, offers
scheduling flexibility.
Via Mobility Services – incumbent, strong maintenance and training, no start-up.
The key weaknesses of each proposal are as follows:
Apple Bus Company – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
First Transit – requires start up activities.
Global Transportation – proposed Maintenance Manager, not acceptable to RTD, maintenance plan
undeveloped.
Horizon Coach Lines – expansion to 25% service levels would require facility relocation.
McDonald Transit Associates – several key personnel did not meet minimum requirements.
MV Transportation – high turn-over rate.
Ride Right – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
SCR Medical Transportation – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
Trinity Transit – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
Veolia Transportation (dedicated vehicle) – proposed Maintenance Manager has limited experience at the
25% service level.
Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated vehicle) – limited quality control.
Via Mobility Services – operational logistics concerns at the 25% service level.
The total overall scores regardless of the proposed service model, including SBE rating and cost rating
were as follows:
MV Transportation –
Via Mobility –
First Transit –
Horizon Coach Lines –
Veolia (dedicated) –
Global Transportation –

Veolia was the only proposer to bid on the non-dedicated vehicle option.

An evaluation of the total program cost was made by identifying the firms that scored in the competitive
range and then comparing the proposed prices for the 50%, 25%, and16.6% service levels. The service
model deemed most advantageous to the District in terms of both quality and cost resulted in a
combination of one 50% provider (MV Transportation) and two 25% providers (Via Mobility and Horizon
Coach Lines). It was the consensus of the evaluation team that these firms presented the best proposals
in terms of the understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed organization,
approach to deliver the requested service, attainment of SBE goals and proposed price.
The evaluation team also considered maintaining the current four provider model. Using the costs
provided by the lowest priced service provider for the 50% service level plus the lowest prices of the

Packet Pg. 88

2.12.P

three service providers in the competitive range for the 16.6% service level, resulted in an overall
program cost increase of $4.5 million dollars over the five-year contract term. However, the evaluation
team had questions regarding changing the service model from four contractors to three and increasing
the proposed providers from a 16.6% to a 25% service level. Oral presentations were conducted with
the firms in the competitive range for the provision of 25% service model: Horizon Coach Lines, Veolia
Transportation (dedicated vehicle), and Via Mobility Services. The purpose of the oral presentations was
to offer these firms an opportunity to further articulate their operating plan and to respond to the
questions of the evaluation team. Furthermore, Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated
vehicle) was invited to provide clarification on the non-dedicated vehicle approach to providing Access-aRide services. At the conclusion of the oral presentations, the evaluation team again met and concluded
that the three provider service model represented the best model for the District and our passengers.
Therefore, the recommendation of the evaluation committee was to contract with MV Transportation to
provide 50% of the revenue hours, Horizon Coach Lines to provide 25% of the revenue hours, and Via
Mobility Services to provide 25% of the revenue hours; and to contract with Veolia Transportation to
provide non-dedicated-vehicle Access-a-Ride service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firms’ proposals represent the most responsive and responsible proposals received in response to the
RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical, SBE and price
issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP
document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
higher than the prices offered by the recommended service providers. The estimated cost was based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses. The financial comparison of the top
three proposals at the 50% and 25% service levels to the top four proposals at the 50% and 16.6%
resulted in the three provider model yielding a $4.5 million dollar savings to the District over the fiveyear contract term.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2014 requested
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
2)

3)

Award contracts to Horizon Coach Lines, MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services,
and Veolia Transportation on Demand as recommended.
Maintain current levels of service, one 50% service provider and three (3) 16.6% service
providers for an additional cost of $4.5 million dollars. This is not recommended as it does
not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process.
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate (ICE).

Paratransit Service Extension and Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to extend contracts with Horizon Coach Lines and Global Transportation
for the provision of Access-a-Ride services and with Via Mobility Services and MV Transportation for the
provision of Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services for a period of three (3) months at the following notto-exceed costs. For Access-a-Ride services: Horizon Coach Lines – service $1,385,003, fuel
$207,513, total $1,592,516; Global Transportation – service $1,343,251, fuel $207,513, total
$1,550,764; Via Mobility Services – service $1,386,102, fuel $207,513, total $1,593,615; MV
Transportation – service $3,676,213, fuel $622,543, total $4,298,756. For Call-n-Ride services: Via
Mobility Services – service $358,632, fuel $60,444, total $419,076; MV Transportation – service
$824,052, fuel $150,659, total $974,711. The cumulative total not-to-exceed costs are as follows:
Access-a-Ride service $7,790.570, Access-a-Ride fuel $1,245,081 and Access-a-Ride total
$9,035,650; and Call-n-Ride service $1,182,685, Call-n-Ride fuel $207,356 and Call-n-Ride total
$1,390,040.

BACKGROUND
In June of 2012 the RTD Board of Directors approved a one (1) year extension to the Access-a-Ride
service contracts with MV Transportation, Global Transportation, VIA Mobility, and Horizon Coach
Lines.
The extension also included the Call-n-Ride services which were assigned to MV
Transportation and Via Mobility. The extension was approved, in part, to allow staff to fully analyze
the benefits of utilizing non-dedicated vehicles for a portion of the Access-a-Ride service.
Approximately two years ago, several Board Members requested that an evaluation be conducted
with respect to a relatively new concept of offering paratransit services via non-dedicated vehicles.
While the usage of non-dedicated vehicles has been a viable form of transportation within the taxi
and human services arena, their use within the strictly enforced parameters of ADA paratransit had
not yet been fully demonstrated or analyzed. During the last two years, staff had been critically
assessing new service delivery models to include the possibility of incorporating non-dedicated
vehicles as a resource.
Non-Dedicated Service operates with vehicles that do not provide
transportation exclusively for a particular service such as Access-a-Ride, but are also used to
transport other passengers when not engaged in providing paratransit service. These drivers and
vehicles are in essence, hired for a particular time and when released, continue to use their vehicles
for other matters.

DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the recent procurement of the Access-a-Ride service and the recommendation by staff
to move from four (4) dedicated vehicle providers to three (3) dedicated vehicle providers and one (1)

Packet Pg. 91

2.12.Q

non-dedicated vehicle provider, an extension of three (3) months is being requested in order to
facilitate a smooth transition to the new service model. Two of the dedicated-vehicle providers will
be increasing their service level from 16.6% of the Access-a-Ride service to 25%. This will require
increases in driver, mechanic and staff levels and modifications to operating facilities. A three (3)
month extension to the existing Access-a-Ride contracts will provide adequate time for the
contractors to accomplish these tasks.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no budgetary impact as these funds have been budgeted for in the 2014 requested budget.

Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate
Swap Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached modifications to the RTD Interest Rate Swap Policy.
BACKGROUND
The District’s Interest Rate Swap Policy (the “Policy”), attached, serves to direct the implementation and
management of interest rate exchange agreements (“swaps”) entered into between the District and
qualified swap counterparties. The Policy requires review by the Board at least annually.
An interest rate swap is a financial contract in which two parties agree to exchange a stream of cash
flows according to pre-arranged terms for a fixed period of time. Swaps may be utilized to produce
interest savings, to limit or hedge variable rate payments, to alter the pattern of debt service payments,
to lock in a current or future fixed borrowing rate, to create additional variable rate exposure and/or to
facilitate asset/liability management.
DISCUSSION
The District is not counterparty to any outstanding swap agreements at this time and staff is not
anticipating the need to enter a swap agreement at any point in the foreseeable future. Also, all
outstanding and currently planned debt of the District has a fixed interest rate. Should opportunities
arise in the future to utilize swaps to produce savings or present other economic benefits to the District,
staff will inform the Board in that regard.
Staff is recommending that the annual review requirement of the Policy be changed so that the Board
does not need to review the Policy on an annual basis unless the District is involved in or planning to
enter a swap agreement.
Some additional language changes are also being recommended to clarify the Policy and to reflect the
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The attached redline draft of the Policy reflects changes recommended by staff, most notably the
change to the policy that would only require the Board to review the Policy annually so long as the
District is involved with or planning to enter a swap agreement.

ATTACHMENTS
As noted above, please refer to the attached redline copy of the Interest Rate Swap Policy which
identifies the changes recommended by staff.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the revised Interest Rate Swap Policy. This is the recommended action.

Regional Transportation District
Interest Rate Swap Policy
I.

Introduction:
The purpose of the Interest Rate Swap Policy of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) is to establish guidelines for the use and management of interest rate swaps.
The Interest Rate Swap Policy is intended to provide general procedural direction
regarding the use, procurement and execution of interest rate swaps. The Policy is
intended to relate to various interest rate hedging techniques, including the
contractual exchange of different fixed and variable rate payment streams through
interest rate swap agreements (for purposes of this policy, the term “interest rate swap
agreements” is intended to encompass, to the extent permitted by law, interest rate
swaps, caps, collars, floors, rate hedges for future issuances, basis swaps, and certain
other financial products used by municipal entities when accessing the capital
markets) and is not intended to relate to other derivative products that RTD may
consider.

II.

Scope and Authority:
This Interest Rate Swap Policy shall govern the RTD’s use and management of all
interest rate swaps. While adherence to this Policy is required in applicable
circumstances, the RTD recognizes that changes in the capital markets, District
programs and other unforeseen circumstances may from time to time produce
situations that are not covered by the Policy and will require modifications or
exceptions to achieve policy goals. In these cases, management flexibility is
appropriate provided specific authorization from the Board is obtained.
The Interest Rate Swap Policy shall be reviewed and updated at least annually and
presented to the Board of Directors for approval so long as the District is involved in
or planning to enter an interest rate swap agreement. Day-to-day responsibility for
management of interest rate swaps shall fall within the responsibilities of the Chief
Financial Officer.
The District shall be authorized to enter into interest rate swap transactions only with
qualified swap counterparties. The Chief Financial Officer, in consultation with the
District’s bond counsel and financial advisor, shall have authority to select the
counterparties, so long as the criteria set forth in the Interest Rate Swap Policy are
met.

III.

Approach and Objectives:
Interest rate swaps are appropriate interest rate management tools that can help RTD
meet important financial objectives. Properly used, these instruments can increase
RTD’s financial flexibility, modify interest rate exposure, provide opportunities for

Packet Pg. 95

Attachment: Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy)

2.12.R.a

interest rate savings, hedge or mitigate interest rate risk for future financings and help
RTD manage its balance sheet through better matching of assets and liabilities. Swaps
should be integrated into RTD’s overall debt program and should not be used for
speculation.
Swaps are appropriate to use when they achieve a specific objective consistent with
RTD’s overall financial strategies. They may be used, for example, to lock in a
current or future market fixed rate or create additional variable rate exposure. They
may also be used to produce interest rate savings, to limit or hedge variable rate
exposure, to alter the pattern of debt service payments or for asset/liability matching
purposes.
IV.

Conditions for Use of Interest Rate Swaps:
A. General Usage:
In connection with the use of any interest rate swap agreement, the RTD’s Board of
Directors shall make a finding that the authorized interest rate exchange agreement(s)
will be used to alter, hedge or reduce interest rate risk and/or alter the cost of
borrowing in a beneficial manner, and when used in combination with to-be-issued,
new or outstanding bonds, will enhance the relationship between risk and return or to
achieve other policy objectives of the District.
B. Maximum Notional Amount:
The RTD will limit the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps based
on criteria set forth in this Interest Rate Swap Policy regarding the proper
management of risks, calculation of termination exposure, and development of a
contingency plan. The total “net notional amount” of all swaps related to an
individual bond issue should not exceed the outstanding or expected par amount of
the related bonds. For purposes of calculating the net notional amount, consideration
shall be given to multiple swaps on the same series of bonds which have a layering,
offsetting, or mitigating effect.
C. Maximum Maturity:
RTD shall determine the appropriate term for an interest rate swap agreement on a
case-by-case basis. In connection with the issuance or carrying of bonds, the term of
the swap agreement between RTD and a qualified swap counterparty shall not extend
beyond the final maturity date of related bonds.
D. Liquidity Considerations:
RTD shall consider the impact of any variable rate bonds issued in combination with
an interest rate swap on the availability and cost of liquidity support for other variable
rate programs. The RTD recognizes that there may be at any point in time a limited

2

Packet Pg. 96

Attachment: Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy)

2.12.R.a

supply of letter of credit or liquidity facility support for RTD variable rate bonds, and
the usage of liquidity support in connection with an interest rate swap may result in
higher overall costs for the District.
E. Call Option Value Considerations:
When considering the relative advantage of an interest rate swap to fixed rate bonds,
the RTD will consider the value of the call option on fixed rate bonds. The value
derived from the ability to call bonds at a future date may be foregone when using a
swap for the remaining term of the bonds unless the swap is customized to
incorporate a cancellation option on behalf of the RTD. While fixed rate RTD bonds
are typically structured with a call provision at a certain time, after which the bonds
may be refunded, this opportunity may be lost through the utilization of a long-dated
swap, impairing the District’s ability to reap economic savings.
V.

Interest Rate Swap Features:
A. Interest Rate Swap Agreement:
RTD will use terms and conditions as set forth in the International Swap and
Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) Master Agreement or such other swap
documentation which may be appropriate. The swap agreement between RTD and
each swap counterparty shall include payment, term, security, collateral, default,
remedy, termination, and other terms, conditions, provisions and safeguards as the
RTD, in consultation with its legal counsel, and financial advisor deems necessary or
desirable.
Subject to the provisions contained herein, the terms of any RTD swap agreement
shall use the following guidelines:
1.
2.
3.

4.

5.

RTD’s downgrade provisions triggering termination shall in no event be
worse than those affecting the counterparty.
Governing law for swaps will be New York.
The specified indebtedness related to credit events in any swap agreement
should be narrowly defined and refer only to indebtedness of the RTD that
could have a materially adverse affect on RTD’s ability to perform its
obligations under the swap.
Collateral thresholds for the swap provider should be set on a sliding scale
reflective of credit ratings of the swap provider or guarantor and the RTD.
Collateral posted by RTD should be held by an independent third party.
Eligible collateral should generally be limited to U.S. Treasury obligations
and other obligations the principal and interest of which are backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Eligible collateral shall be
limited to those investment obligations which are legal investments for
RTD.

Packet Pg. 97

6.

2.12.R.a

Termination value should be set by a “market quotation” methodology,
unless RTD deems an alternate appropriate.

B. Interest Rate Swap Counterparties:
1.

Credit Criteria:
RTD shall make its best efforts to work with qualified swap counterparties
only if, at the time the transaction is entered into: (a) the long-term debt
obligations of the counterparty or its credit support provider or guarantor
are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by one or more
nationally recognized securities rating agencies which regularly rate such
obligations; or (b) the obligations under the agreement of the counterparty
are either (i) guaranteed by a party whose long-term debt obligations are
rated in one of the two highest rating categories by one or more nationally
recognized securities rating agencies which regularly rate such
obligations; or (ii) collateralized by obligations which are legal
investments for the RTD and which maintain a market value of not less
than one hundred percent of the principal amount upon which the
exchange of interest rates is based. The nationally recognized rating
agencies are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation
and Fitch Ratings.
In addition, qualified swap counterparties must have a demonstrated
record of successfully executing swap transactions as well as creating and
implementing innovative ideas in the swap market.

C. Counterparty Termination Exposure:
In order to diversify RTD’s counterparty credit risk, and to limit its credit
exposure to any one counterparty, the RTD will compute the “Maximum Net
Termination Exposure” prior to executing a swap with any counterparty. No
counterparty may exceed the Maximum Net Termination Exposure outlined
below.
“Maximum Net Termination Exposure” is the aggregate termination payment
exposure, net of the value of collateral posted or that would be posted in
accordance with the swap agreement with such counterparty, for all existing and
projected swap transactions with an individual counterparty. For purposes of this
calculation, the aggregate termination payment is equal to the expected worst-case
net termination amount for the existing transactions and the proposed transaction
over the life of all existing and proposed transactions. The expected worst-case
termination payment shall be calculated assuming interest rates, as measured by
the appropriate swap market yield curve, increase (or decrease) by two standard
deviations from the on-market forward swap rate over the term of the swap
portfolio with the counterparty.

$20 million
$10 million

D. Collateral Requirements:
As part of any swap agreement, the RTD may, based upon credit ratings of the
counterparty, require collateralization or other forms of credit enhancement to
secure any or all swap payment obligations. As appropriate, RTD, in consultation
with its counsel and financial advisor, may require collateral or other credit
enhancement to be posted by any swap counterparty if the long-term unsecured
credit rating of the counterparty or parent falls below the A category by any one
of the organizations rating agencies that regularly rate such counterparties.
Additional collateral for further decreases in credit ratings of each counterparty
shall be posted by each counterparty in accordance with the provisions contained
in the collateral support agreement to each counterparty with the District.
Threshold collateral amounts shall be determined by the RTD on a case-by-case
basis. The RTD will determine the reasonable threshold limits for the initial
deposit and for increments of collateral posting thereafter. Collateral shall be
deposited with a third party custodian, or as mutually agreed upon by the RTD
and the counterparty. A list of acceptable securities that may be posted as
collateral and the valuation of such collateral will be determined and mutually
agreed upon during the negotiation of the swap agreement with each swap
counterparty. The market value of the collateral shall be determined on a daily
basis.
E. Swap Insurance
If, after a cost/benefit analysis, it is determined that it would be beneficial to
insure the interest rate swap, swap insurance will be pursued.
F. Security and Source of Repayment:
The District will generally use the same security and source of repayment
(pledged revenues) for the interest rate swap as is used for the related bonds issue
unless circumstances exist which require the use of an alternate security or
repayment source .

5

Packet Pg. 99

G. Prohibited Interest Rate Swap Features:
The RTD will not use interest rate swaps that are: (i) speculative or create
extraordinary leverage or risk, (ii) lack adequate liquidity to terminate without
incurring an extraordinary bid/ask spread, (iii) provide insufficient price
transparency to allow reasonable valuation, or (iv) are used as investments.
VI.

Evaluation and Management of Interest Rate Swap Risks:
Prior to the execution of any swap transaction, the District’s Chief Financial Officer,
financial advisor and bond counsel shall evaluate the proposed transaction and report
the findings to the RTD Board. Such a review shall include the identification of the
proposed benefit and potential risks. As part of this evaluation, the RTD shall
compute the Maximum Net Termination Exposure to the proposed swap
counterparty.
A. Evaluation Methodology:
RTD will review the following areas of potential risk for new and existing interest
rate swaps:
Type of Risk

Description

Evaluation Methodology

Basis Risk

The mismatch between actual
variable rate debt service and
variable rate indices used to
determine swap payments.
The risk created by potential tax
events that could negatively
affect swap payments.

The RTD will review historical
trading differentials between the
variable rate bonds and the index.

Tax Risk

Counterparty Risk

The risk that the counterparty
fails to make required payments.

Termination Risk

The risk that the transaction is
terminated in a market dictating
termination payment by the
RTD.

Rollover Risk

The mismatch of the maturity of
the swap and the maturity of the
underlying bonds.

Liquidity Risk

The inability to continue or
renew a liquidity facility or
Letter of Credit.

6

The RTD will review the tax
events
in
proposed
swap
agreements. It will also evaluate
the impact of potential changes in
tax law on LIBOR indexed swaps
and the expected savings from
retaining tax risk.
The
RTD
will
monitor
counterparty ratings, exposure
levels, ratings thresholds and
collateralization requirements.
RTD will periodically compute its
termination exposure for all
existing and proposed swaps at
market value and under a worstcase scenario.
RTD will determine its capacity to
issue variable rate bonds that may
be outstanding after the maturity
of the swap.
RTD will evaluate the expected
availability of liquidity support
for swapped and unhedged
variable rate debt.

Contingency Plan:
The RTD shall compute the termination exposure of each of its
swaps and its total swap termination payment exposure at least
annually and prepare a contingency plan to either replace the swaps
or fund the termination payments, if any, in the event one or more
outstanding swaps are terminated. The RTD shall assess its ability to
obtain replacement swaps and identify revenue sources to fund
potential termination payments.

C. Terminating Interest Rate Swaps
1.

Optional Termination:
RTD may structure interest rate swaps to include optional
termination, which would allow the District to terminate a swap prior
to its maturity if it is determined that it is financially advantageous to
do so. The District may also purchase cancellation options which
would allow cancellation of the swap on a specified date or dates
without having to make a termination payment.

2.

Mandatory Termination:
In the event a swap is terminated as a result of a termination event
such as a default or credit downgrade of either counterparty, the
RTD will evaluate whether it is financially advantageous to obtain a
replacement swap or, depending on market value, make or receive a
termination payment.
In the event RTD makes a swap termination payment, the RTD shall
attempt to follow the process identified in its swap contingency plan.
The RTD shall also evaluate the economic costs and benefits of
incorporating a provision into the swap agreement that will allow the
RTD to make termination payments over time.

VII.

Procurement:
RTD will not have a fixed guideline with respect to swap procurement. Rather, it will
assess the benefits of competitively bidding financial products that are nonproprietary or generally available in the marketplace. On a product-by-product basis,
RTD may choose to negotiate the procurement of financial instruments. Qualified
swap counterparties are financial institutions meeting the credit criteria outlined in
this Policy. Counterparties may be institutions not included in RTD’s underwriting
pool.
In determining whether a swap procurement will be negotiated or competitive, RTD
staff shall consider, among other things, the then existing market for the type of
transaction expected to be entered into, counterparty diversification, the availability
of counterparties for the type of transaction expected to be entered into, the size of the
transaction, the costs and expenses associated with a negotiated versus a competitive
undertaking, and the proprietary nature of the proposed transaction or application
thereof and the service provided by the counterparty in developing an idea or strategy
that benefits the RTD. In the event that the transaction is to be negotiated or
competetitive, the RTD staff shall retain the services of an independent,

8

2.12.R.a

Packet Pg. 102

knowledgeable individual or firm to advise the Authority District as to the fairness of
the pricing of the transaction.
In the event it is determined that the payment agreement will be competitively bid,
the RTD staff reserves the right to limit the (a) number of qualified counterparties that
may participate in a single swap agreement bid and (b) notional amount of swap
agreements with any counterparty, either for any individual swap or in the aggregate.
VIII.

Disclosure and Financial Reporting:
RTD will take steps to ensure that there is full and complete disclosure of all interest
rate swaps to the RTD Board of Directors, rating agencies and in disclosure
documents. Disclosure in marketing documents shall provide a clear summary of the
special risks involved with swaps and any potential exposure to interest rate volatility
or unusually large and rapid changes in market value. With respect to its financial
statements, the RTD will adhere to the guidelines for the financial reporting of
interest rate swaps as set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board.

Bid/Ask Spread: The difference between the bid price (at which a market maker is
willing to buy) and the ask price (at which a market maker is willing to sell).
Call Option: The right to buy an underlying asset (e.g. a municipal bond) after a
certain date at a certain price. A call option is frequently embedded in a municipal
bond, giving the issuer the right to buy, or redeem, the bonds at a certain price.
Collateral: Assets pledged to secure an obligation. The assets are potentially subject
to seizure in event of default.
Downgrade: A negative change in credit ratings.
Forward Starting Swap: Interest rate swap that starts at some time in the future. Used
to lock-in current interest rates.
Hedge: A transaction that reduces the interest rate risk of an underlying security.
Interest Rate Exchange Agreement: An agreement detailing the contractual exchange
of interest payment streams between counterparties. Often the exchange of a fixed
and a floating interest rate between two parties. Also called an interest rate swap.
Interest Rate Swap: An agreement detailing the contractual exchange of interest
payment streams between counterparties. Often the exchange of a fixed and a floating
interest rate between two parties. Also called an interest rate exchange agreement.
Liquidity Support: An agreement by a bank to make payment on a variable rate
security to assure investors that the security can be sold.
LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate. Often used as an index to compute the
variable rate paid on an interest rate swap.
Maximum Net Termination Exposure: The aggregate termination payment for all
existing and projected swap transactions that would be paid by an individual
counterparty. For purposes of this calculation, the aggregate termination payment is
equal to: (i) the termination payment based on the market value of all existing swaps
as of the first day of the month prior to the execution of any proposed transaction,
plus (ii) the expected worst-case termination payment of the proposed transaction.
The expected worst-case termination payment shall be calculated assuming interest
rates, as measured by the appropriate index (typically the Bond Buyer Revenue Bond
Index or Bond Market Association), increase (or decrease) by two standard deviations
from the sample mean over a period of time corresponding to the term of the swap.

2014 Internal Audit Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
recent State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the
internal audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit
plan, the title of the auditor assigned, and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of
twenty (20) audits are planned. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for
this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 13, 2013

From:

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager, Civil Rights
Division

GM

Date:

November 13, 2013

Board Meeting Date: November 21, 2013

Subject:

Recommendation for Adoption of ADA Program
Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Americans with
Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board of Directors affirms that it is a priority of
RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with disabilities in accordance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to
provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to further this policy direction.
BACKGROUND
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, was the precursor to the ADA and
protects qualified individuals from discrimination based upon a disability. Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act applies to entities that receive federal assistance including RTD.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12601 et seq., was passed in 1990, and
amended in 2008 pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act (PL110-325). The sections of the ADA
applicable to RTD are the first two titles. Title I applies to employment practices and Title II applies to
public services. Part B of Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12141 et seq. specifically covers public transportation
provided by public entities. This law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, requires the
provision of paratransit service, and sets standards for transportation facilities and vehicles.
The Department of Justice regulates and enforces Section 504 and the ADA, except that the
Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”) administer the
mass transportation provisions of Section 504 and the ADA, and DOT has issued implementing
regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 27, 37 and 38.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s Senior Leadership Team believes that providing equal access to its programs and services for the
people with disabilities community is an important priority for RTD. Because of the diverse ways in
which RTD is affected by and impacts people with disabilities community, RTD needs to designate a
single individual who is responsible for directing a plan to achieve the policy directive. The Senior
Manager, Civil Rights, has sufficient visibility within RTD and the relevant resources to effectively
develop the ADA program.1 Accordingly, the Senior Manager, Civil Rights, should be designated as the
RTD ADA Coordinator; in that role, the Senior Manager, Civil Rights can implement an ADA Program
Plan. The ADA Program Plan defines RTD’s policy priorities and creates a framework by which RTD
1

When the ADA was initially passed, RTD had designated the Senior Manager, Human Resources as the ADA Coordinator.
Since that time, RTD has established a Civil Rights division and created the position of Senior Manager, Civil Rights, which is a
more appropriate position to take on the duties of ADA Coordinator.

Packet Pg. 118

2.12.T

employees, consultants and contractors will continue to work together to provide equal access
enterprise-wide for people with disabilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact at this time.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board
of Directors affirms that it is a priority of RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with
disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The
purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to
further this policy direction.
2. Designate Another Individual as ADA Coordinator. The Board could designate another individual or
individuals as ADA Coordinator. This is not recommended because no other individual is as uniquely
suited to address this civil rights issue as the Sr. Manager, Civil Rights, although other members
within the organization will be responsible for implementing certain aspects of the ADA Program
Plan.
3. No Action. The Board of Directors may take no action. This is not recommended because providing
equal access to its programs and services for people with disabilities community is an important
priority for RTD, and adopting the ADA Program Plan is consistent with that priority.

EMPLOYMENT

RTD prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in regard to job application
procedures, hiring, advancement or discharge of employees, employee compensation, and
other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.
Although all RTD employees have a responsibility to maintain a workplace environment
free of unlawful discrimination and harassment, RTD’s Equal Opportunity (“EO”) Office (a
subdivision of RTD’s Civil Rights Division) is responsible for investigating and resolving
complaints of discrimination and harassment in violation of RTD’s EEO policy. Complaints
should be made to a supervisor or the EO Office. Verbal complaints must be followed up
with a complaint form. Formal complaint forms are available in the EO Office (x2190) or
on the Intranet; questions and complaints can be sent to EqualOpportunity@rtddenver.com.
RTD also intends to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental
impairments of qualified individuals with a disability, as defined by the ADA, unless
undue hardship or a direct threat would result. Individuals seeking a reasonable
accommodation should immediately make the request known to a supervisor or the
Senior Manager, Human Resources, who is empowered to act on behalf of the ADA
Coordinator specifically for requests for reasonable accommodations for employment
purposes. In this role, the Sr. Manager, Human Resources will be responsible for
investigating and responding to the request and engaging in the interactive process. The
Sr. Manager, Human Resources may delegate this responsibility from time to time to the
Labor Relations Office for requests made by employees in the bargaining unit.
In the event that an internal complaint or request for reasonable accommodation is not
satisfied, an individual may file a charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Civil Rights.
The EO Office and the Senior Manager, Human Resources are responsible for developing
guidance manuals, best practices tools, and training to ensure that RTD staff, consultants
and contractors understand and implement RTD’s ADA employment objectives.

6.0

TRANSPORTATION

RTD prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of its transportation
services. The ADA implementing regulations also require the provision of paratransit
service and set standards for transportation facilities and vehicles.
Although all RTD employees have a responsibility to provide equal access enterprise-wide
for people with disabilities, the ADA Coordinator (Sr. Manager, Civil Rights) is responsible
for investigating and resolving complaints of discrimination and harassment from
passengers and the public. Formal complaints should be made to the ADA Coordinator at
(303)299-2221 or email to ADACoordinator@rtd-denver.com. Verbal or informal
complaints must be followed up with a complaint form. RTD may forward certain
complaints from disabled passengers made to RTD’s Telephone Information Center,
through RTD’s website or email complaints system, or social media if the individual
making the complaint can be identified, to the ADA Coordinator for tracking and/or
resolution.

Approval of Contract Award to Graham,
Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors for the
Design and Construction of the North Metro
Rail Line Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors ("Board")
authorize the General Manager to award the design/build contract and negotiate final terms with
Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail
Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to
162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum
amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to
124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and Intergovernmental
Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue within
the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other contributions and to increase
the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work. The General Manager will
also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and issue a notice to proceed
for that phase, should funding become available. This option would be presented to the board through
the annual budget appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) of an
amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the Project scope as
described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks
program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks program. It also
provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be available at a
later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek innovative
approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013 GM Task Goal
#1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state, and federal stakeholders; and
Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state, local, private sector, and
other funding sources for FasTracks).

The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in downtown Denver
and the Denver Tech Center.
The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and parts of Adams
County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and provides regional connectivity to a major
portion of the metro area, including Denver International Airport.

BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County. RTD has been working
closely with stakeholders in these jurisdictions to identify ways to expedite construction of this corridor.
Quarterly meetings are held and RTD and the stakeholders have been working collaboratively towards
this goal.
The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was conducted for the North Metro Rail line between 2006
and 2010. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the North
Metro Rail Line in April 2011. RTD is constructing the project without federal funds. The RFP for the
Project incorporated the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIS and these mitigation
measures will therefore be included as contractual obligations. Since that time, RTD has identified and
moved forward with early action items related to the North Metro Rail Line. These included acquisition of
six EMU commuter rail vehicles; design and construction of an expansion to the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility to house an additional 30 EMU vehicles ultimately required for 2035 ridership;
installation of duct bank at DUS for the North Metro line; contracted with AECOM to design the rail line
from DUS to 72nd Avenue; began the acquisition process for necessary properties between DUS and 72nd
Avenue; began the utility relocation process between DUS and 72nd Avenue; and performed work at the
Bambei-Walker Reservoir. These early action items saved considerable future costs to the project.
Most importantly, RTD concluded an agreement with the Union Pacific Railroad for acquisition of the
Boulder Industrial Lead, which is the right-of-way being used north of 72nd Avenue. The cost of this
acquisition was $117.8 million in 2009, which was a significant commitment of funds to this corridor.
RTD has also negotiated intergovernmental agreements with regard to North Metro with the City and
County of Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn, Adams County and CDOT.
RTD also has taken actions to provide funding for construction as it becomes available. In June, 2010,
the RTD Board programmed $90 million for the construction of the North Metro Rail Line from DUS to
the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) Station out of the $305 million pool in FasTracks funds
remaining from the Eagle P3 bids that were received below budget. In February, 2013, the Board
approved refinancing three outstanding debt issuances, and committed to use the future savings from
these refinancings to finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line from the NWSS Station to 72 nd
Avenue.
The current recommended action to build to 124th Avenue would not have been possible without those
RTD Staff recommendations and those prior approvals by the RTD Board. Approval of this action will
also require RTD to submit an amendment to the DRCOG 2035 RTP reflecting both the extended North
Metro Rail Line construction and operation and the significant schedule acceleration. Specifically, as

Packet Pg. 125

2.13.U

previously authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in February 2013, the 2035 RTP currently reflects
construction of the North Metro Rail Line only to 72nd Avenue by 2018. This action will significantly
accelerate and extend the North Metro Rail Line compared with the financial projections from February
2013. Further, this is being accomplished without impact to any of the other RTD FasTracks or base
system projects committed to in the current DRCOG 2035 RTP as adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.
Over the past couple of years, RTD has publicized the agency's desire to seek out innovations from the
industry to complete the FasTracks program as soon as possible. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum,
Transformation Through Transportation (T3). RTD's goal was to encourage and attract "out-of-the-box"
thinking that would generate innovative industry solutions throughout the District. As part of the T3
process, RTD revised and published its unsolicited proposal policy. The policy and effort as it relates to
the FasTracks program of projects has the objective of seeking innovation from the private sector that
will enable RTD to complete more of the FasTracks program, sooner than what is currently programmed.
In February 2013, RTD received an Unsolicited Proposal from Graham Contracting Limited related to the
North Metro Rail Line. In accordance with RTD's Unsolicited Proposal Policy, each submitted proposal is
reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the proposal has merit and is consistent with the
unsolicited proposal policy criteria.
In March 2013, following RTD staff review and evaluation of the Graham Contracting Limited proposal,
it was determined that it did have technical merit and the competitive process was initiated. The RTD
staff completed development of a design/build and financial solutions Request for Proposals (RFP), which
was advertised on June 28, 2013. The RFP was written in three phases:
 Phase 1: Design/Build from DUS to 72nd Avenue
 Phase 2: Design/Build on four individual segments from 72nd Avenue to end of line at 162nd
Avenue (72nd–88th, 88th-104th, 104th-124th, 124th-162nd), and offer financial solutions
 Phase 3: Design/Build and offer financial solutions for any or all of the three extensions (Central,
Southwest and Southeast Rail lines), or other potential projects
This effort is consistent with our Mantra to “Build as much as we can, as fast as we can, until it’s all
done”. The private sector has taken our Mantra seriously and has responded. The T3 process and this
unsolicited proposal effort for the North Metro corridor are also consistent with the guiding principles for
FasTracks.
 Ensure every step contributes to the full vision
 Focus money available to the greatest good
 Spend public money wisely
 Maximize outside funding before going to taxpayers
 Deliver key investments in all corridors
DISCUSSION
Following an advertisement period of approximately twelve weeks, RTD received four competitive
proposals for the project on September 23, 2013, from the following teams:
1. Bechtel/Herzog Joint Venture which includes AECOM and financial partner Societe General
2. Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) which includes Stantec Design, Parsons
Brinckerhoff and financial partner BMO Capital Markets
3. North Metro Transit Solutions (NMTS), a Kiewit/Stacy and Witbeck joint venture which includes
Atkins Design, Mass Electric, and financial partner RBC Capital Markets

Packet Pg. 126

2.13.U

4. URS Energy and Construction, Inc. which includes Lawrence Construction, Aldridge Electric and
financial partner Piper Jaffray
The RTD staff evaluated the four competing proposals based on the best value criteria established for
this procurement:
Financial
1. Design/Build Cost Proposal – DUS to 72nd Avenue
2. Design/Build Cost Proposal – 72nd Avenue to 162nd Avenue, scored by segment as defined above
3. Financial Innovation/Creativity
Technical
1. Technical Innovation/Creativity
2. Technical Approach
3. Management Organization, Experience and Approach
4. DBE/SBE/WIN Approach
RTD established review teams to evaluate the technical and financial parts of each proposal. In addition
to the technical and financial review teams, key stakeholders (City and County of Denver, Cities of
Commerce City, Northglenn and Thornton, Adams County and the Colorado Department of
Transportation) also participated in the evaluation. The technical, financial and stakeholder teams
presented the results of their evaluation to the Evaluation Committee.
Following the evaluation and scoring, the Evaluation Committee worked collaboratively and unanimously
recommended to the General Manager to select GBBH for negotiation of a contract.
GBBH submitted a proposal for the North Metro Rail line to 162nd Avenue, broken out by the segments
defined above. Based on financial capacity at this point in time, RTD is recommending awarding the
contract from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Given this information, GBBH provided a BAFO
price for a consolidated contract to 124th Avenue, reducing its bid price by $20.5 million from the
original proposal to issue Notice to Proceed (NTP) for individual segments. GBBH also provided an
option, with the price to be held for two years, that could be exercised to complete the North Metro
project to 162nd Avenue when funding becomes available. GBBH also provided option prices for the
Southeast, Southwest and Central extensions, subject to an escalation clause defined in the RFP;
extension of the North Metro line to Longmont; extension of the Northwest Line to 88th Avenue. These
options can be evaluated when funds become available.
The design/build contract initial Notice to Proceed will include the following elements from Denver Union
Station to 124th Avenue:
 Design, construction and testing of all Civil and Systems elements including the following
stations:
o National Western Stock Show station and park-n-Ride
o 72nd Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 88th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 104th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 112th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
o 124th Avenue station and park-n-Ride
 Interface, integration and coordination with the Eagle Project in design, fabrication and installation
of traction electrification systems, train control and PTC systems, SCADA and Security and
Communications systems
 Demolition of structures identified for removal

Packet Pg. 127

2.13.U



Right of way (ROW) management between 72nd Avenue and 124th Avenue.

The following basic components are included in the contract:
1. Payment Agreement for the Lump Sum Contract.
2. RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 23% for design and 21% for
construction, which applies to the total value of all work performed under the contract. The
contractor has committed to exceeding these goals by an additional 1% each. The contractor also
has presented a plan to include a minimum of 1% SBE participation.
3. The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a.
Professional Service – Goal 4%: Participants may perform professional services such as
design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration, easement
acquisition, and public information duties.
b.
Skilled Craft – Goal 8%: Participants should perform skilled construction related activities
such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic work, or similar
skilled construction work. Laborer activities will only be allowed if incidental to a higher
skilled journey worker status.
4. Davis Bacon and Buy America Requirements - The contractor will be required to use Davis-Bacon
wage rates and comply with Buy America regulations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
After review of the financial proposals, staff determined that it would be in RTD’s best interest to
finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line through RTD issuance of Certificates of Participation
(COP) with the North Metro Rail Line as the collateral. Staff modeled financial alternatives to determine
how much of the North Metro Rail Line could be built and operated within RTD’s current projected
financial capacity. The financial projections considered the contractors bid, RTD’s internal costs for
items such as ROW, vehicles, and construction management, future costs to operate the line, and debt
service on the COPs. In addition, the projections considered the impacts of an increase in COP interest
rates due to a potential ratings downgrade on RTD COPs. This analysis determined that RTD would
have the capacity to build and operate the corridor to 124th Avenue while maintaining the Board 1.2
times net revenue, bond test, and allowing fund balance policy.
Funding for this contract and the associated RTD cost of construction will be provided through the staff
identified and Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances,
potential use of the FasTracks Internal Savings Account, and issuance of COPs to provide $430 million
in construction funds. Separate Board actions will be presented for issuance of the COPs, and for a
reimbursement resolution if needed.
Funding of the North Metro Rail Line will not affect the planned financing or construction schedule for
other FasTracks projects. RTD currently has limited remaining TABOR capacity to issue sales tax bonds
or enter into other types of loan agreements. The North Metro Corridor is unique in that it meets the
criteria for RTD to use it as collateral for a COP at this time. As a result, RTD is able to finance this
corridor and conserve TABOR capacity for other opportunities that do not qualify for COP financing.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the design/build
contract and negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve
as the Contractor for the North Metro Rail Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of the
North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 162nd Avenue with a Notice to Proceed to 124th

Packet Pg. 128

2.13.U

Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this
proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts, and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount not to exceed the remaining
project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate
and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; and
Intergovernmental Agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project
to 162nd Avenue within the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other
contributions and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project
work. The General Manager will also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd
Avenue and issue a notice to proceed for that phase, should funding become available. This option
would be presented to the board through the annual budget appropriation and with approval of
financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
direct RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) of an amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035 RTP) consistent with the
Project scope as described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the FasTracks
program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks program. It
also provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope is not likely to be
available at a later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek innovative
approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013 GM Task
Goal #1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state, and federal
stakeholders; and Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all potential federal, state,
local, private sector, and other funding sources for FasTracks).
 Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit dependents both
temporary and long-term, to key job centers and provides clean, safe, reliable, accessible and
cost effective transportation in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
 The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in downtown Denver
and the Denver Tech Center.
 The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and parts of Adams
County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and provides regional connectivity to a
major portion of the metro area, including Denver International Airport.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead direct staff to negotiate a lesser scope with the
recommended proposer. This is not recommended. There is no guarantee that the reduced scope will
result in a similar reduction in cost as it would require a significant change in the proposer’s entire
approach. This option would not encourage building as much as we can, as fast as we can.

Packet Pg. 129

2.13.U

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a new
contract award to Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors. This is not recommended as we
would be giving up a firm, fixed price commitment from a contractor to complete a key segment of
the FasTracks program that is not likely to be available in the future.

Amendment of ADA Contracts for Call-n-Ride
Service Awards

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the new ADA paratransit services contracts
with MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #13-DH-035) for the provision of Calln-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is for three years, with two one-year
options and shall not exceed $19,039,885 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. The
amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years, with two one-year options and
shall not exceed $8,692,084 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. In addition, these contracts
will include a cost for fuel which will be treated as a pass through expense. The total 5-year estimated
cost for Call-n-Ride fuel for MV Transportation is $3,333,539 and for Via Mobility Services is
$1,380,399. The total 5-year not-to-exceed cost for MV Transportation is $22,373,424. The total 5year not-to-exceed cost for Via Mobility Services is $10,072,483.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Call-n-Ride services were included in the Access-aRide services RFP because these services had been assigned to and were operated by ADA paratransit
service providers under the existing contracts. Past experience has shown that the cost of Call-n-Ride
service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride service because of reduced overhead costs.
All of the existing Call-n-Ride services (with the exception of the Evergreen CNR) were divided into three
(3) service packages and proposers were allowed to bid on one or two packages. Proposers were
required to bid on Access-a-Ride service in order to also bid on Call-n-Ride service (Call-n-Ride service
was not a “stand alone” service option). Proposers were not required to submit a separate proposal for
Call-n-Ride service, but they were required to detail how they would address the unique operational
requirements of the service.
The Call-n-Rides included in each package are as follows:
Package A
Arapahoe
Belleview
Dry Creek
Highlands Ranch
Lone Tree
Meridian
North Inverness
Orchard
Parker

Package B
Belmar
Golden
Green Mountain
South Jeffco

Package C
Brighton
Broomfield
Federal Heights
Interlocken
Longmont
Louisville
South Thornton

2.13.V

South Inverness
The new contracts for ADA paratransit service include the option for the assignment of Call-n-Ride
service so that Call-n-Ride service can be assigned to those contracts.
DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the evaluation of the Access-a-Ride RFP responses and recommendation for contract
award, the Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated. Only proposers that were recommended to provide
Access-a-Ride service were considered to provide Call-n-Ride services. The Call-n-Ride proposals were
evaluated on the following criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation
(40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small
Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).
Via Mobility Services, formally known as Special Transit, has operated Call-n-Ride service for
approximately twelve years. The management team is well experienced in the provision of Call-n-Ride
service. Via Mobility currently provides Call-n-Ride service from a facility in the Boulder area and a
facility in the Denver area. This allows a quicker response time in case of vehicle maintenance problems
and cuts down on excessive deadhead mileage and fuel expenses.
MV Transportation has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately ten years. MV Transportation
proposed a team comprised of experienced Call-n-Ride managers and drivers, and it has provided quality
Call-n-Ride service throughout its tenure. The MV Transportation facility is located in the south metro
area which provides good access for the Call-n-Rides in service packages A & B.
Horizon Coach Lines does not have any experience operating Call-n-Ride service for RTD. Horizon’s
initial RFP response provided pricing for Call-n-Ride package C. During the follow up interview with the
Horizon team, the organization identified that it had intended to bid on package B, not package C. In
addition to this oversight, the Horizon proposal provided very limited discussion on the operation of the
Call-n-Ride and the proposed Call-n-Ride Supervisor had limited experience managing this type of service.
The evaluation of the Call-n-Ride service proposals and pricing resulted in a recommendation to assign
Call-n-Ride Packages A and B to MV Transportation under the ADA paratransit contract and Call-n-Ride
Package C to Via Mobility Services under the ADA paratransit contract. The contracts to provide these
services are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2014.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2014 requested
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)

Assign Call-n-Ride service to MV Transportation and Via Mobility as recommended. This is
recommended as both contractors’ personnel have Call-n-Ride experience and can provide
the direct supervision for a smooth contract transition.

Packet Pg. 158

2.13.V

2)

Assign Call-n-Ride service to another ADA paratransit contractor. This alternative is not
recommended as the other contractor will be experiencing an increase in their Access-aRide revenue hours and this will be a new service for them. This would also contradict the
results of the evaluation process.

Award Contract to Supply 125 – 40’ LowFloor Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to Gillig LLC for the purchase of 125 – 40’ low-floor
transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed $51,800,000, with an option to
purchase up to 307 additional 40’ buses over a five year period.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion 40’ transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years or 500,000
miles. The buses are coming up to 14 years old and have accumulated on average 585,000 miles of stop-andgo transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The bus manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business a few years ago. Many components for bus
repair have become difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the replacement of
the 2000 Series buses over the next three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014, 64 buses in 2015 and
10 buses per year afterward.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 24, 2013 for the procurement of 40’ transit buses. The
RFP solicited proposals that offer buses in different power configurations: clean diesel, CNG and hybrid
electric. Proposals were received on September 4, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from four companies: Gillig, New Flyer, Nova Bus, and North American Bus Industries
(NABI).
The proposers submitted their costs as follows.

NABI

$473,066

$512,269

No Bid (Series Hybrid)
$665,570 (Parallel Hybrid)

Staff has performed a life cycle cost analysis of the different power configurations to determine the most cost
effective and efficient propulsion power system for the new buses.
The hybrid buses are $166,565 (for the series hybrid) or $191,419 (for the parallel hybrid) higher in unit cost
than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able to purchase 85 to 89 hybrid buses for the available
budget instead of the 125 replacement vehicles desired.
Based on RTD’s experience of 20% better fuel economy for the hybrid buses and its current diesel fuel
purchase price, it would take between 31 and 36 years to reach the break-even point on the capital
investment for hybrid buses. This far exceeds the twelve (12) year useful life of the vehicle. Accordingly, hybrid
vehicles were eliminated from further consideration.
The CNG buses are $47,960 higher in unit cost than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able
to purchase 112 CNG buses for the available budget instead of 125 replacement vehicles desired.
In order to convert to CNG operations, RTD must also invest in new CNG stations and safety modifications
of existing maintenance and parking facilities. Since the 40’ buses will be distributed to all three RTD’s
divisions and four private operators’ divisions, all seven divisions would have to be modified for CNG. The
CNG stations required for fueling CNG vehicles at seven divisions are estimated to cost upward of $17.3
Million. The facility modifications to these divisions to bring them into compliance with fire codes for safe
operations of CNG fuel are estimated to cost up to $31.4 Million. The total facility upgrades for the seven
divisions are estimated to result in a $48.7 million investment. No funding has been identified to finance
these necessary capital improvements.
Currently, CNG fuel cost is equal to about 50% of diesel fuel cost. Based on the RTD’s average year to date
purchase prices of $3.26 per gallon of diesel and $1.62 per diesel gallon equivalent of CNG, together with
the assumption that the price differential between diesel fuel and CNG fuel would stay the same
throughout the future years under this analysis, it would take 13 years to reach the break-even point on
the capital investment for CNG buses and required facility upgrades.

The CNG analysis by staff indicates:

Savings in CNG fuel cost will be more than offset by the higher cost of bus purchase and
upgrading the maintenance and parking facilities.

Prices of natural gas and diesel fuel have been historically extremely volatile. There is no
guarantee that the current pricing advantage of natural gas over diesel fuel will continue into the
future. Examples of the price volatility are shown below.


There are no significant air quality impacts to convert from diesel to CNG operations. Both new
clean diesel and new CNG buses have significantly lower emissions than the older buses they replace.
The emissions of new clean diesel and CNG buses are considered to be the same.

The CNG facility upgrade will take at least two years to implement. Going with CNG buses will
delay the bus procurement process at least two years.

In the past CNG buses showed higher maintenance costs than diesel buses. However, in the
last several years, CNG engine technology has improved. Even though CNG buses require certain new
costs for CNG related maintenance such as CNG engine sparkplug replacement and high pressure fuel
system maintenance, staff has assumed CNG and diesel maintenance costs to be equivalent.

The reliability and durability of CNG engines are still questionable at high altitude and cold
weather conditions, coupled with the usage of low energy natural gas available in Denver metro area.
High altitude conditions cause loss of engine power and hotter engine operating temperature. Cold
weather causes CNG engine starting problems. Denver’s natural gas has lower energy content than the
rest of the country. Low energy gas causes engine operating issues.

CNG is a combustible gas at very high pressure (3,600 pounds per square inch of pressure).
Safety and security for the operation of CNG are of concern.

The high cost CNG stations and associated facility upgrades may become obsolete in 12 years at
the end of life of the buses under this procurement. Electric vehicle technology appears to be the
preferred technology of the future. A number of electric buses are currently in production or under
demonstration by bus manufacturers. As electric bus technology is still in its infancy, it currently has
issues such as high purchase cost and low operating range. In the upcoming years, it is expected that
the technology will advance and production processes will improve, allowing the bus cost to come
down and the operating range to increase.
There are risks that the very large investment in CNG facility upgrades and CNG buses may not pay off; that
the savings on CNG fuel may not be realized due to commodity price fluctuations; that the CNG technology
may become obsolete to better engine technologies currently being demonstrated such as electric vehicles;
and that CNG operational difficulties may be experienced under RTD’s high altitude, cold climate and low
energy natural gas usage. In addition, no funding has been indentified to finance the CNG facility upgrades.

Based on the above considerations, staff has recommended that RTD stay with clean diesel technology as a
good public policy.
The proposals were also rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability.
Gillig submitted the lowest cost proposal, which is also rated highly for its technical ability. Gillig’s proposal is
the most responsive, responsible, lowest cost and best value proposal. Gillig meets and exceeds RTD technical
specification requirements. Gillig has the experience and qualification in the manufacture of transit buses,
being one of the oldest and most financially stable manufacturers in North America. Gillig offered a lifetime
warranty against bus structure corrosion damage. Gillig proposed a delivery schedule that meets RTD’s 12month delivery schedule requirement.
The 40’ buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be equipped with a
wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their clean diesel engines will
meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the existing
buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a security digital camera
system. The 40’ buses will have two passenger doors and 36 passenger seats.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This current contract is for the purchase of 125-40’ low-floor transit buses and associated spare components
in the amount not to exceed $51,800,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the
District’s 2013 Adopted Budget, and also identified in 2014 Requested Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a five year period. Pricing for
additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment
computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate authorizations from the RTD Board of
Directors.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required proposal
submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES


To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Gillig for the purchase of 125 clean diesel 40’
low-floor transit buses and associated spare components. This is the recommended alternative.



Award the contract to Gillig for a smaller quantity of CNG 40’ buses (112 buses) with the available
budget. This is not the recommended action as it would delay the bus purchase from one to two years
due to the long process to construct the CNG fuel stations and modify the maintenance and parking

facilities. CNG requires higher bus purchase costs and multi-million dollar facility costs, which will
offset the CNG fuel savings. There are risks of operational difficulty for CNG buses in RTD’s high
altitude and cold weather conditions, in addition to the availability of only low energy natural gas in
Denver metro area. In addition, no funding has been identified to finance the necessary capital
improvements.


Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would result,
at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.
