November Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Anderson called for a review of the agenda. General Manager Washington indicated
we would have a special recognition of 2 awards that were given to the FasTracks for
engineering excellence.

Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve moving the
November Board agenda to the full Board for a vote on
November 26, 2013.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley noted that Terry Howerter , CFO, and
Jannette Scarpino do a good job with the budget and
with working with the Board members so they can
understand.
Director Hoy asked a question about the IGA and noted
it does not include Brighton. General Manager

Washington indicated we are working on this but this is
not showstopper.

Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the design/build contract

consisting of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 162 nd Avenue
with a Notice to Proceed to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum
amount of US $343.3 million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North

Metro corridor to 124th Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as funds
become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into
all contracts, and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the

that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue
within the scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other

contributions for project work. The General Manager will also be granted authority to
exercise the option to extend to 162nd Avenue and issue a notice to proceed for that
phase, should funding become available. This option would be presented to the board
through the annual budget appropriation and with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council
of Governments (DRCOG) of an amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan
(2035 RTP) consistent with the Project scope as described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire
region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of
the FasTracks program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks
program. It also provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and
scope is not likely to be available at a later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek
innovative approaches to delivering the program.
 It is consistent with the RTD Board’s stated direction to the General Manager (2013
GM Task Goal #1: Pursue collaborations and partnerships with local, regional, state,
and federal stakeholders; and Task Goal #2: Actively and aggressively pursue all
potential federal, state, local, private sector, and other funding sources for
FasTracks).
 Completion of this North Metro Rail Line maximizes mobility for transit dependents
both temporary and long-term, to key job centers and provides clean, safe, reliable,
accessible and cost effective transportation in keeping with RTD's overall mission.
 The line provides access for northern residents to major employment centers in
downtown Denver and the Denver Tech Center.
 The North Metro Rail Line connects Thornton, Northglenn, Commerce City and
parts of Adams County with all other rail lines via Denver Union Station and
provides regional connectivity to a major portion of the metro area, including
Denver International Airport.

V. Amendment of ADA Contracts for Call-n-Ride Service Awards

of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the new ADA

amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years, with two oneyear options and shall not exceed $8,692,084 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride

III.

Other Matters


General Manager Washington shared they are working an issue on the US 36
related to the BRT bus. According to a recent survey, 86% of the riders stated
they prefer an over the road bus similar to the MCI bus; however, the stakeholders
are advocating for a different bus or to take an RFP out for bid. No decision has
been made but he expects this will be a hard discussion. Director Bagley asked for
clarification on the discussion. Is the discussion that the stakeholders would prefer
a RFP for a different type of BRT bus rather than exercise the option that we have
for the MCI bus? General Manager Washington responded yes. Chair Anderson
noted she had lunch with one of the members on the US 36 and had heard about
these concerns.
Director Daly asked if there is ignorance in the public on what BRT is. General
Manager Washington responded that in the survey, participants were asked about
the type of vehicle that they prefer. Director Daly inquired if the public understands
a low-floor vehicle for BRT may have it struggle in a location like Boulder due to the

terrain traveled versus in other cities where these seem to work best in an arterial
street environment.
General Manager Washington indicated they are talking to the manufacturer about
the possibility of rear door to address some of the concerns. Director Hoy asked if
the spacing between the fare box and the bulkhead is a little narrower on the newer
buses and if that could be addressed. He thinks this could also address some the
concerns expressed by the stakeholders.
Director Daly noted we need to educate the stakeholders on pre-paid media.

Chair Anderson asked if we can get the users and stakeholders in a common
environment for this discussion on BRT vehicles. Director Walker added that
perhaps we can set up a focus group of riders and stakeholders so they will hear
the same thing.
Director Daly inquired about the fare taskforce and asked if staff will accept
questions from the Board. General Manager Washington responded yes. Director
Hoy added that whether or not Board members would become participants, he
thinks the taskforce need to provide updates to the Board on what the taskforce is
doing, when they meet, etc. General Manager Washington responded they will
provide an update in January, 2014.
Director Bagley indicated that he had seven comments under other matters:
o He met with Tami Door and Elba Wedgeworth and think it may be a good
idea to invite them here to talk about the collaboration between Downtown
Denver Partnership and RTD.
o He does not want to receive the IT advisory e-mails-this should not include
Board members
o For the December 4 Board Effectiveness workshop, he is happy that about
80% of the Board members plan to attend. He thinks we should focus on
meeting protocols.
o He does not believe that a Board member calling into a meeting should be
able to make a motion.
o The dates for the next series of GM Oversight meets are November 26,
December, 3, 10 & 17. He encourages members of the Executive
Committee to attend.
o He took a ride on the D-line along with Detective John Perry and Jessie
Carter. They discussed some of the safety and signaling issues. Both of
them did a great job. They encountered a couple of challenges along the
way having to do with the door not shutting and signaling issues at Park
West. It is interesting to see how a few challenges can have a ripple effect
through the whole system. There is a history with some of the issues and

stations along 27 & 29th but there is real impact to the connections off 30th
& Downing. He represents the D-line so he is very interested in how we can
improve performance along this route.
Director Anderson indicated we should set up a tour for the full Board.
Director Daly commented that the D-line is unique in the whole city. It is the
only one that travels completely within the city and subject to all the
challenges along the route.

Director Walker indicated that he attended one of the DUS scheduling meetings.
The primary concern was two-way parking and concern over bus traffic impact
along 18th St.
Director Walker stated he did not understand what all the concern was about on
the 30th & Downing station. Several people expressed their opinion about this
including the fact that according to DPD, this is not the site with the largest
amount of crime. Director Hoy felt the “emotionalism” and “sensationalism”
that the media sometimes gives to these events attribute to the responses.
Director Bagley shared an incident that happened about two years ago in
Littleton and indicated this can happen anywhere.
Director Daly announced the ATU Election Board is December 2, 2013.
