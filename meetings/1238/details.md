## III. Other Matters

- General Manager Washington shared they are working an issue on the US 36 related to the BRT bus.  According to a recent survey, 86% of the riders stated they prefer an over the road bus similar to the MCI bus; however, the stakeholders are advocating for a different bus or to take an RFP out for bid.  No decision has been made but he expects this will be a hard discussion.  Director Bagley asked for clarification on the discussion.  Is the discussion that the stakeholders would prefer a RFP for a different type of BRT bus rather than exercise the option that we have for the MCI bus?  General Manager Washington responded yes.  Chair Anderson noted she had lunch with one of the members on the US 36 and had heard about these concerns.

Director Daly asked if there is ignorance in the public on what BRT is.  General Manager Washington responded that in the survey, participants were asked about the type of vehicle that they prefer.  Director Daly inquired if the public understands a low-floor vehicle for BRT may have it struggle in a location like Boulder due to the  terrain traveled versus in other cities where these seem to work best in an arterial street environment.

General Manager Washington indicated they are talking to the manufacturer about the possibility of rear door to address some of the concerns.  Director Hoy asked if the spacing between the fare box and the bulkhead is a little narrower on the newer buses and if that could be addressed.  He thinks this could also address some the concerns expressed by the stakeholders.

Director Daly noted we need to educate the stakeholders on pre-paid media.

Chair Anderson asked if we can get the users and stakeholders in a common environment for this discussion on BRT vehicles.  Director Walker added that perhaps we can set up a focus group of riders and stakeholders so they will hear the same thing.

- Director Daly inquired about the fare taskforce and asked if staff will accept questions from the Board.  General Manager Washington responded yes.  Director Hoy added that whether or not Board members would become participants, he thinks the taskforce need to provide updates to the Board on what the taskforce is doing, when they meet, etc.  General Manager Washington responded they will provide an update in January, 2014.

- Director Bagley indicated that he had seven comments under other matters:

o        He met with Tami Door and Elba Wedgeworth and think it may be a good idea to invite them here to talk about the collaboration between Downtown Denver Partnership and RTD.

o        He does not want to receive the IT advisory e-mails-this should not include Board members

o        For the December 4 Board Effectiveness workshop, he is happy that about 80% of the Board members plan to attend.  He thinks we should focus on meeting protocols.

o        He does not believe that a Board member calling into a meeting should be able to make a motion.

o        The dates for the next series of GM Oversight meets are November 26, December, 3, 10 & 17.  He encourages members of the Executive Committee to attend.

o        He took a ride on the D-line along with Detective John Perry and Jessie Carter.  They discussed some of the safety and signaling issues.  Both of them did a great job.  They encountered a couple of challenges along the way having to do with the door not shutting and signaling issues at Park West.  It is interesting to see how a few challenges can have a ripple effect through the whole system.  There is a history with some of the issues and stations along 27 & 29th but there is real impact to the connections off 30th & Downing.  He represents the D-line so he is very interested in how we can improve performance along this route.

Director Anderson indicated we should set up a tour for the full Board.

Director Daly commented that the D-line is unique in the whole city.  It is the only one that travels completely within the city and subject to all the challenges along the route.

- Director Walker indicated that he attended one of the DUS scheduling meetings.  The primary concern was two-way parking and concern over bus traffic impact along 18th St.

- Director Walker stated he did not understand what all the concern was about on the 30th & Downing station.  Several people expressed their opinion about this including the fact that according to DPD, this is not the site with the largest amount of crime.  Director Hoy felt the “emotionalism” and “sensationalism” that the media sometimes gives to these events attribute to the responses.  Director Bagley shared an incident that happened about two years ago in Littleton and indicated this can happen anywhere.

- Director Daly announced the ATU Election Board is December 2, 2013.
