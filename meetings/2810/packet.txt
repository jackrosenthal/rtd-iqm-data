Subject:

Board Meeting Date: March 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute
contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside legal counsel to
represent RTD for a total amount not to exceed $8.5 million.
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD has received certain claims from RTD’s contractors for both the Eagle P3 and NMRL Projects that
may lead to dispute resolution or litigation. RTD has engaged certain law firms to assist RTD’s General
Counsel and the RTD Legal Services Division (RTD Law) to evaluate and initially respond to those claims,
as well as to administer and manage RTD’s efforts to preserve and collect information potentially related
to those claims. The approved 2018 Budget included funding designated and available for contracts with
legal firms engaged as outside counsel.
DISCUSSION
The General Counsel has determined that it is reasonably likely that one or more of the pending claims
involving FasTracks projects may lead to more complex dispute resolution and litigation requiring the
continued expertise and resources of outside law firms to represent RTD in those matters. The General
Counsel requests the Board’s approval to engage outside law firms, or amend existing contracts with
law firms, to provide legal representation in such litigation. At this time, the requested amount is the
best estimate of funding required for 2018. If litigation extends into 2019, a further recommended
action may be necessary.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed primarily with funding from the Board-approved 2018 FasTracks
project budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance and Administration
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and
execute contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside
legal counsel to represent RTD in a total amount not to exceed $8.5 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the Recommended Action is not adopted, RTD’s
General Counsel would need to find alternative legal representation for RTD, or would need to
obtain Board approval for individual contracts or amendments. This could seriously impair RTD’s
ability to satisfy its legal obligations and act in its own best interest in defending pending claims,

Statewide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts Resolution ___ for RTD to join the Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP), a
local government investment pool (LGIP).
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
LGIPs are trusts established by local governments who desire to work together by pooling portions of
their investments to gain efficiencies of scale, reduce administrative costs and improve auditing and
transparency. There are currently three LGIPs in Colorado as defined in Title 24, Article 75, Part 7 of
the Colorado Revised Statutes. RTD currently participates in two of the three LGIPs, known as CSAFE
and ColoTrust, both of which have existed since the 1980’s. RTD’s Senior Manager of Debt &
Investments is the current Treasurer of the Board of Trustees for CSAFE.
In 2016, the SEC’s money market reform effort led to reduced choices for Colorado governments when
it comes to overnight liquidity investments. As a result, a new local government investment pool (CSIP)
was created in 2017 to offer additional diversity and choice for Colorado local governments and their
daily liquidity needs.
CSIP’s liquidity portfolio is AAAm rated by S&P. S&P describes the CSIP liquidity portfolio as follows:
“The Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP) is a statutory trust organized pursuant to the
provisions of Article 75, Title 24, Part 7 of Colorado Statutes. CSIP provides professional investment
services designed specifically to meet the cash management needs of Colorado governments, including
counties, municipalities, school districts and special districts. CSIP's goal is to help local governments
achieve their objectives of safety, liquidity, and competitive returns.”
CSIPs TERM portfolio is AAAf rated by Fitch Ratings, the highest rating in its category.
The investment manager and administrator for CSIP is PFM, the trustee bank is US Bank.

DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 6

2.12.B

Joining CSIP would offer RTD enhanced investment diversity and liquidity without adding any additional
cost.
CSIP is an allowable type of investment per RTD’s current Investment Policy and is similar in
characteristic to other investments currently made by RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Resolution would not create any cost to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves and adopts Resolution ___ for RTD to join the Colorado Statewide Investment
Pool, a local government investment pool.
2. Board modifies the recommended Resolution.
3. Do not adopt the Colorado Statewide Investment Pool Resolution. This is not recommended
because RTD would not benefit from reduced diversification and liquidity.

designation or they may adopt such other name for the Trust as they deem proper, and the Trust may
hold property and conduct its activities under such designation or name. The Trustees shall take

ARTICLE II – CREATION OF TRUST

2.5

Purpose; Participant Requirements; Changes of Incumbency.

(a)
The purpose of the Trust is to provide a surplus funds trust fund in accordance with
Colorado law permitting Local Governments to pool monies available in their treasuries, which are
not immediately required to be disbursed, with the same such monies in the treasuries of other
Local Governments, in order to invest them and earn interest in accordance with, and as permitted
by, the provisions of the Investment Pooling Act and the Legal Investments Act or other laws of the
State of Colorado governing the investment of monies of a Local Government, and as allowed by
law. No Participant shall be required to appropriate any funds or levy any taxes to establish or
contribute to this Trust. The Trustees may provide for the payment or repayment of any expenses
from the earnings of the Trust.
(b)
Only those Local Governments which adopt this Indenture and have complied with
the provisions of this section may become Participants. The Designee empowered to invest funds
of each Local Government or such other person designated by the Participant to serve in such
capacity (an “Alternate Designee”), shall be the legal representative to act for and on behalf of
such Local Government for purposes of this Indenture.
(c)
Each Local Government adopting this Indenture, and otherwise complying with the
provisions hereof, shall become a Participant only upon adopting this Indenture and depositing
into the Trust the minimum total investment as that amount is established from time to time by the
Trustees. Whenever the balance in a Participant's account is less than the minimum established by
the Trustees, the Trustees may redeem the Shares and close the account; provided that thirty (30)
days’ prior notice shall be given to such Participant and redemption shall only be permitted if the
Participant has not restored the balance in the account to the minimum amount established prior
to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period which begins with the date of such notice. If the
Trustees change the minimum total investment to an amount greater than the investment of any
Participant at the time that such change becomes effective, the investment of such Participant shall
not be redeemed without such Participant's consent.
(d)
In the event that a Designee shall no longer be authorized to act on behalf of such
Participant as a Designee, and in the absence of any duly-appointed Alternate Designee, any funds
placed in the Trust by such Designee shall be held hereunder for the benefit of the Local
Government for which he or she was acting at the time the vacancy or termination of authority
occurred. Any Designee assuming office, either to fill a vacancy in such office or to begin a new
term following the expiration of the term in office of his or her predecessor, or otherwise becoming
authorized to act as Designee on behalf of such Participant, shall become the succeeding legal
representative of the Local Government by the Local Government filing written notification of such
with the Trustees in a form acceptable to the Trustees.
2.6 Trustees; Signatory Public Agencies and Participants. No Signatory Local
Government or Participant, nor any or its officers, employees, agents or representatives shall have
any liability under this Indenture as a result of service by its Designee as a Trustee.
2.7
Voting. Each Participant of record holding Shares shall be entitled to vote, through its
Designee or an Alternate Designee, on the following matters: (a) Election of the Board, (b)

2.12.B.b

Amendment of this Indenture, (c) Termination of the Trust, and (d) Reorganization of the Trust.
Each Participant shall be entitled to one vote for each whole share held by the Participant and each
Participant shall be entitled to one fractional vote for each fractional share held by the Participant. A
proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Participant shall be deemed valid unless
challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.
The Trustees shall determine any such challenge and their decision shall be final. The approval of a
simple majority of the voting Shares shall be sufficient to approve any action at a meeting or other
election of the Participants except as provided in Sections 10.4. and 14.1.
All matters other than the (a) Election of the Board, (b) Amendment of this Indenture, (c)
Termination of the Trust, and (d) Reorganization of the Trust shall be decided through a vote of the
Board of Trustees. Each Trustee shall be entitled to cast one vote and such vote shall not be allocated
on the basis of the number of Shares held by that Trustee’s Local Government.

the Trust Representative was adjudged liable to the Trust, or (ii) in connection with any proceeding
charging improper personal benefit to him or her, in which such person was adjudged liable on the
basis that such personal benefit was improperly received by him or her in connection with a
proceeding by or in the right of the Trust. Indemnification is in all cases limited to reasonable
expenses incurred.
(d)
Except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section, the termination of any
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, is not of itself determinative that the individual did not meet the standard of conduct set
forth in subsection (b) of this Section.
(e)
No indemnification shall be made unless and until a specific determination has been
made that indemnification is authorized under this Section 6.3. Such determination shall be made by
the Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum, which quorum shall consist of Trustees not parties to
the proceeding. If such quorum cannot be obtained, the determination shall be made by a majority
vote of a committee of Trustees designated by the Trustees, which committee shall consist of
two or more Trustees not party to the proceeding. Trustees who are parties to the proceeding may
participate in designating Trustees for the committee. If the said quorum cannot be obtained or the
committee cannot be established, or if such quorum is obtained or committee is designated and
such quorum or committee so directs, the determination may be made by independent legal

counsel selected by a vote of the Trustees or the committee as specified above. If independent
counsel determines that indemnification is required under this Section, authorization of
indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by the body that
selected such counsel.
(f)
The Trust may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a Trust
Representative who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition thereof if (i) the Trust
Representative furnishes the Trust a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he or she has
met the standard of conduct described in subsection (b) of this Section and a written undertaking
executed personally to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that indemnification is not
authorized under this Section, and (ii) it is determined as provided in subsection (e) above that the
facts then known would not preclude indemnification under this Section.
(g)
Any indemnification of or advance of expenses to a Trust Representative pursuant to
this Section shall be reported in writing to the Participants as soon as practicable, if such
indemnification of or advance of expenses arises out of a proceeding by or on behalf of the Trust.
(h)
No Trust Representative entitled to indemnification may take or be paid the same
except out of the earnings of the Trust, and no Participant shall be personally liable to any such

other security for the performance of any of his duties.

employee or agent or make inquiry concerning or be liable for the application of money or property
paid, transferred or delivered to or on the order of the Trustees or of such officer, employee or
agent.
6.6
Representative Capacity; Recitals. Any written instrument creating an obligation
of the Trust shall be conclusively taken to have been executed by a Trustee or an officer, employee
or agent of the Trust only in his capacity as a Trustee under this Indenture or in his or her capacity
as an officer, employee or agent of the Trust. Any written instrument creating an obligation of the
Trust shall refer to this Indenture and shall contain a recital to the effect that the obligations
thereunder are not personally binding upon, nor shall resort be had to the property of, any of the
Trustees, Participants, officers, employees or agents of the Trust, and that only the Trust Property
or a specific portion thereof shall be bound, and such written instrument may contain any further
similar recital which may be deemed appropriate; provided however, that the omission of any
recital pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not operate to impose personal liability on any of the
Trustees, Participants, officers, employees or agents of the Trust, or to void any obligations created
in the instrument.
6.7
Reliance on Experts. Each Trustee, officer and employee of the Trust shall, in
the performance of his or her duties, be fully and completely justified and protected with regard to
any act or any failure to act resulting from reliance in good faith upon the books of account or

shall be paid from Trust property as an expense of administration of the Trust.

ARTICLE VII - INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
7.1
Beneficial Interest. The interest of the beneficiaries hereunder shall be divided into
transferable units to be called Shares, all of one series except as permitted by Section 7.10, without
par value. The number of Shares authorized hereunder is unlimited. Except as otherwise permitted
under Section 7.10 hereof, each Share shall represent an equal proportionate interest in the net assets
of the applicable series within the Trust. All Shares issued hereunder including, without limitation,
Shares issued in connection with a dividend in Shares or a split of Shares, shall be fully paid and
nonassessable.
7.2
Title to Trust Property. Title to the Trust Property of every description and the
right to conduct any affairs herein described are vested in the Trustees on behalf, and for the
beneficial interest, of the Participants, and the Participants shall have no individual interest therein
other than the beneficial interest conferred hereby and measured by their Shares, and they shall
have no right to call for any partition or division of any property, profits, rights or interests of
the Trust nor can they be called upon to share or assume any losses of the Trust or suffer an
assessment of any kind by virtue of the allocation of Shares to them, except as expressly provided
in this Indenture. Provided, further, that this provision shall not be interpreted or construed to
modify or limit any of the rights of Participants expressed anywhere else in this Indenture or as
provided by law. The beneficial interest hereunder measured by the Shares shall not entitle a
Participant to preference, preemptive, appraisal, conversion, or exchange rights of any kind with
respect to the Trust or the Trust Property, except as the Trustees may determine.
7.3
Evidence of Investment. Evidence of each Participant’s investment shall be reflected
in a Share Register maintained by or on behalf of the Trust in accordance with Section 8.1 hereof,
and the Trust shall not be required to issue certificates as evidence of Share allocation.
7.4
Redemptions. In case any Participant at any time desires to dispose of its Shares, it
may deposit a written request or other such form of request as the Trustees may from time to time
authorize, at the office of the transfer agent or at the office of any bank or trust company, either in or
outside of Colorado which is a member of the Federal Reserve System and which the transfer agent
has designated by the Trust for that purpose, together with an irrevocable offer in writing in a form
acceptable to the Trustees to have the Shares redeemed by the Trust at the net asset value thereof per
share, next determined as provided in the Information Statement after such deposit. Payment for

Packet Pg. 29

2.12.B.b

redemption shall be made to the Participants within the number of business days specified in the
Trust’s current Information Statement, unless the date of payment is postponed pursuant to Section
7.5 hereof, in which event payment may be delayed beyond such period.
7.5
Suspension of Redemption; Postponement of Payment. Each Participant, by its
adoption of this Indenture, agrees that the Trustees may, without the necessity of a formal meeting
of the Trustees, temporarily suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment
for withdrawal of funds from the Trust for the whole or any part of any period;
(a)
During which there shall have occurred any state of war, national emergency, act of
God, banking moratorium or suspension of payments by banks in the State of Colorado or any general
suspension of trading or limitation of prices on the New York Stock Exchange or the American
Stock Exchange (other than customary week-end and holiday closing); or
(b)
During which any emergency situation exists, as a result of which disposal by the
Trust of Trust Property is not reasonably practicable because of the substantial losses which might
be incurred, or it is not reasonably practicable for the Trust fairly to determine the value of its net
assets.
Such suspension or postponement shall not alter or affect a Participant's beneficial interest
hereunder or the accrued interest and earnings thereon. Such suspension or payment shall take effect
at such time as the Trustees shall specify but not later than the close of business on the business day
next following the declaration of suspension, and thereafter there shall be no right of redemption or
payment until the Trustees shall declare the suspension or postponement at an end, except that the
suspension or postponement shall terminate in any event on the first day on which the period
specified in subsection (a) or in this subsection (b) shall have expired, as to which the determination
of the Trustees shall be conclusive. In the case of a suspension of the right of redemption or a
postponement of payment to a Participant, a Participant may either (i) withdraw its request for
redemption or (ii) receive payment based on the net asset value next determined after the termination
of the suspension.
7.6.
Redemptions to Reimburse Trust for Loss on Nonpayment for Shares or for
Other Charges. The Trustees shall have the power to redeem Shares owned by any Participant to
the extent necessary (i) to reimburse the Trust for any loss it has sustained by reason of the failure of
such Participant to make full payment for Shares purchased by such Participant, or (ii) to collect any
charge relating to a transaction effected for the benefit of such Participant which is applicable to
Shares as provided in the Information Statement. Any such redemption shall be effected at the
redemption price determined in accordance with Section 7.4. hereof.
7.7.
Redemptions Pursuant to Constant Net Asset Value Policy. The following
provisions shall apply to any series or portfolio of investments of the Trust during any period that
the Trustees, in their discretion, establish a policy of maintaining a constant net asset value per Share.
If for any reason the net income of the Trust attributable to such Shares invested in the same portfolio
shall, at the time of any determination thereof in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Information Statement be a negative amount, then the Trustees shall have power to cause the number
of outstanding Shares of such series or portfolio to be reduced by requiring each Participant to
contribute to the capital of the Trust such Participant’s proportionate part of the total number of
4812-8920-8905.2

2.12.B.b

Shares which have an aggregate current net asset value equal as nearly as may be practicable to the
amount of the Trust’s net loss in respect of such series or portfolio. Each Participant, by becoming a
registered holder of Shares, agrees to make any such contribution which may be required.
7.8. Redemptions in Kind. Payment for Shares redeemed pursuant to Section 7.4. may, at
the option of the Trustees, or such officer or officers as they may duly authorize for the purpose, in
their complete discretion be made in cash, or in kind, or partially in cash and partially in kind. In case
of payment in kind, the Trustees, or their delegate, shall have absolute discretion as to what security
or securities shall be distributed in kind and the amount of the same, and the securities shall be valued
for purposes of distribution at the figure at which they were appraised in computing the net asset
value of the Shares.
7.9 Defective Redemption Requests. In the event that a Participant shall submit a
request for the redemption of a greater amount than is then allocated to such Participant, such
request shall not be honored and, each Participant, by its adoption of this Indenture, agrees that
the Trustees shall have full and complete power to redeem no more than the proportionate
amount allocated to such Participant, at a redemption price determined in accordance with Section
7.4 hereof, sufficient to reimburse the Trust for any fees, expenses, costs or penalties actually
incurred by the Trust as a result of such defective redemption request.
7.10 Series or Class Designations. The Trustees, in their discretion, may authorize the
division of Shares into two or more series, and within a series into two or more classes, and the
different series or classes shall be established and designated, and the variations in the relative rights
and preferences as between the different series or classes within a series shall be fixed and determined
by the Trustees; provided that, all Shares shall be identical except there may be variations so fixed
and determined between different series or classes within a series as to purchase price, right of
redemption and the price, terms and manner of redemption, special and relative rights as to
distributions on liquidation, conversion rights, and conditions under which the several series or
classes shall have separate voting rights and separate investment restrictions.

ARTICLE VIII - RECORD OF SHARES
8.1
Share Register. The Share Register shall be kept by or on behalf of the Trustees,
under the direction of the Trustees, and shall contain (i) the names and addresses of the Participants
(including both a post office address for regular United States mail and a valid electronic mail
address), (ii) the number of Shares representing their respective beneficial interests hereunder, and
(iii) a record of all allocations and redemptions thereof. Such Share Register shall be conclusive as
to the identity of the Participants to which the Shares are allocated. Only Participants whose
allocation of Shares are recorded on such Share Register shall be entitled to receive distributions
with respect to Shares or otherwise to exercise or enjoy the rights and benefits related to the
beneficial interest hereunder represented by the Shares. No Participant shall be entitled to receive
any distribution, nor to have notices given to it as herein provided, until it has given its appropriate

Owner of Record. No Person becoming entitled to any Shares in consequence of
the merger, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy or insolvency of any Participant or otherwise,
by operation of law, shall be recorded as the Participant to which such Shares are allocated and shall
only be entitled to the redemption value of such Shares. Until the person becoming entitled to such
redemption value shall apply for the payment thereof and present any proof of such entitlement as
the Trustees may in their sole discretion deem appropriate, the Participant of record to which such
Shares are allocated shall be deemed to be the Participant to which such Shares are allocated for all
purposes hereof, and neither the Trustees nor the registrar nor any officer or agent of the Trust shall
be affected by any notice of such merger, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or
other event.
8.4
No Transfers of Shares. The beneficial interests measured by the Shares shall not
be transferable, in whole or in part, other than to a Local Government, or the Trust itself for purposes
of redemption. Any attempted transfer to any other person shall be void and of no effect.
8.5 Limitation of Fiduciary Responsibility. The receipt of the Participant in whose name
any Share is recorded or of any party or agent in whose name any Share is recorded for the benefit
of the Participant shall be a sufficient discharge for all moneys payable or deliverable in respect of
such Shares and from all liability to see to the proper application thereof.
8.6 Notices. Any and all notices to which Participants are hereunder entitled and any
and all communications shall be deemed duly served or given if (a) mailed, postage prepaid,
addressed to Participants of record at their last known post office addresses, or (b) sent by electronic
mail addressed to the Participants of record at their last known electronic mail address, in each case
as recorded in the Share Register provided for in Section 8.1 hereof. Copies of such notices shall be
provided to the Participant’s Designee.

amend or alter the provisions of the Indenture, without the vote or assent of the Participants, which
the Trustees, in good faith deem necessary or convenient for the administration and operation of the
Trust, to establish and designate additional series or portfolios pursuant to Section 7.10 hereof, or to
the extent deemed by the Trustees in good faith to be necessary to conform this Indenture to the
requirements of applicable laws or regulations or any interpretation thereof by a court or other
governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, but the Trustees shall not be liable for failing so to
do. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment may be made pursuant to this Section which would:
(i)

sell, convey, assign, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the remaining
Trust Property to one or more persons at public or private sale for consideration which may consist
in whole or in part of cash, securities or other property of any kind, discharge or pay its liabilities,
and do all other acts appropriate to liquidate its affairs, provided, however, that any sale,
conveyance, assignment, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Trust Property shall require approval of the principal terms of the transaction and the nature and
amount of the consideration by affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the Trustees entitled
to vote thereon, and (iii) after paying or adequately providing for the payment of all liabilities, and
upon receipt of such releases, indemnities and refunding agreements as they deem necessary for

majority of the Trustees shall execute and lodge among the records of the Trust an instrument in
writing setting forth the fact of such termination, and the Trustees shall thereupon be discharged
from all further liabilities and duties hereunder, and the right, title and interest of all Participants
shall cease and be cancelled and discharged.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: March 7, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 7, 2018

Board Meeting Date: March 27, 2018

Subject:

May 2018 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2018 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost savings of approximately $153,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
The Recommended Action proposed falls in line with the following GM Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Included herein
is a restructure of service to the US36 & Broomfield Station (Routes 112, 120 and 128). A number of
bus stop consolidations are also proposed affecting Routes 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 38 and 83, in an
effort to improve on-time performance and the overall attractiveness of our service to our customers. We
will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS
Five public meetings were conducted in Boulder, Broomfield, Southeast Denver and at the Blake
Administration Building between February 26th and March 1st. Comments and further details from these
meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment K of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 0L – South Broadway limited: add new trip departing Civic Center Station at 3:58pm
Route 10 – 12th Avenue: bus stops at 12thAvenue Pennsylvania to be retained in both directions.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: retain bus stops at W. Exposition Ave-Zuni St in both directions, retain

both directions. Do not relocate the 16L stop from Perry to Raleigh
Route 38 – 38th Avenue: retain westbound bus stop at W. 38th Ave.- Lipan St. and discontinue
westbound bus stop at W. 38th Ave.- Kalamath St.
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield: run time analyses uncovered a need to add resources to improve ontime performance, as well as to provide recovery time for bus operators on the weekends.
Bolt – Boulder/Longmont: run time analyses uncovered a need to add resources to improve on-time
performance, as well as to provide recovery time for bus operators on the weekends.
Route FF – Flat iron Flyer: run time analyses uncovered a need to add resources to improve on-time
performance, as well as to provide recovery time for bus operators on the weekends.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/ service Efficiencies:
A number of bus stop consolidations are proposed, in an overall effort to improve the attractiveness of
our service. The aim of bus stop consolidation is to provide the appropriate spacing between bus stops,
thereby reducing travel time and increasing on-time performance.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: bus stops consolidation.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: afternoon peak trips to operate to/from Elitch’s only, not Colfax/Federal
and bus stop consolidation.

Route 131 – Iliff: schedule adjustments.

Packet Pg. 43

2.13.C

Route 153 – Chamber Road: reroute south of Aurora Metro Center (see attachment G)
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield: run time analyses requiring significant schedule change
Route AB – Boulder/ Denver Airport: schedule adjustment impacting Boulder Station departures.
Bolt – Boulder/Longmont: run time analyses requiring significant schedule change
Route FF – Flat iron Flyer: run time analyses requiring significant schedule change
Free MetroRide: minor schedule adjustments.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments:
Route 0 – South Broadway: minor schedule adjustments.
Route 0L – South Broadway Limited: minor schedule adjustments.
Changing to summer service levels for routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP, and STAMPEDE Other route
related interline changes as result of a change to summer service levels: (204, 225,206/206F, 208/208F
and Y.
C, D, and L Lines: minor running time adjustments are proposed for the C, D, and L Lines on all service
days as a result of the major change from January that will require some refinement of timing. This will
not alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Due to ongoing labor negotiations there may be a need to make schedule adjustments not currently
listed in this proposal. Any subsequent changes necessary will be listed in the Final Service Change
Brochure prior to the implementation to be consistent with Board policy on public notification.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $153,000 annualized and a reduced requirement of 3 weekday equivalent full time
employees.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed May 2018 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Route 27 – Yale Avenue
During the midday, it is proposed to shift the scheduled DTC trips by 30 minutes, and
eliminate the Swedish Hospital loop. Four passengers currently board four trips in this
area. This proposed change would redistribute layover, resulting in the saving of one
midday bus. Alternative service is available on Route 12 and the Englewood Trolley (the
former ART Shuttle) along Downing Street and Hampden Avenue. (see Attachment F)
Anticipated cost savings is estimated to be $98,400 annualized.

results in a much safer turning movement onto westbound Salida Street. Also, running
time analysis for Routes 42 and 45. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.
Due to low ridership, discontinuance of the following weekday trips is proposed:
- 4:29am eastbound (8 passengers)
- 4:59am eastbound (8 passengers)
- 5:10am westbound (10 passengers)
- 6:40pm westbound (12 passengers)
Overall effect of these changes is to slightly reduce the length of time 15-minute service
frequency is provided on weekdays. Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be
$58,500
Route 46 – South Dahlia
Extend the route from its southern most terminal at Colorado Center Station to the
University Hills area on Saturday and Sundays. This will require an additional weekend
vehicle and approximately 10 platform hours. Anticipated cost is estimated to be
$84,000 annualized

Public Meeting Comments

Monday, February 26, 2018; 6pm
Alfalfa’s Community Room
1651 Broadway, Boulder Co
6:00 PM
Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos, Tegan Rice and Diane Marquiss. There were 16 members
of the public including three City of Boulder Staff members and one representative from Boulder
Transportation Connections. No Board Members attended.
Anita O’Connor stated that the current Route Loop service was not very good, but was better than
nothing. She added that residents at the Presbyterian Manor are in need of the Route JUMP LOOP, due
to challenges in mobility otherwise. The bus is a connection, which allows them to independently
conduct their shopping and other day-to-day activities. Ms. O’Connor added that most of the residents
simply couldn’t afford the cost of VIA Access-a-Ride.
In addition, Ms. O’Connor mentioned that during snowy days access at bus stops can be a challenge,
since not all stops are cleared off snow properly.
Jean Day Alexander: suggested a HOP re-route to replace the proposed discontinued Route JUMP LOOP.
She suggested for the HOP to route westbound, from Downtown Boulder Station, via Canyon Blvd.,
Broadway, Arapahoe to 9th Street. She added that there are 89 residents at the Presbyterian Manor and
that a good number of them use the current route, on various days and times. Ms. Alexander stated that
a re-routed HOP would allow for the connection they need to have access to the rest of the City via RTD
transit. She also added that perhaps, as a compromise, only the ‘short-trips’ which start at Technical
Education Center (63rd/Arapahoe) would be the trips to operate through ‘the loop’ – or that at least one
trip per hour could operate the loop, so that they would not be left without service during the summer.
Natalie Stiffler (City of Boulder staff) informed those in attendance that with the HOP re-route design
underway, Route HOP is scheduled to start serving Arapahoe, between 9th St and Broadway, as of the
RTD August 2018 service changes. She added that the construction related to the 13th Street Underpass
at Arapahoe is scheduled to last throughout the summer, starting with the end of the BVSD school year
and ending with the start of move-in day at CU. Ms. Stiffler shared that the city has revised their
construction plans and now believes, that one lane in each direction will remain open at all times, along
Arapahoe, between 14th St and Broadway. She also quickly gave an overview of the HOP redesign
process.
Eve Booth agreed with Ms. O’Conor’s and Ms. Alexander’s statements and reiterated that the bus stop
at Arapahoe and 9th Street is needed for their mobility. She added that residents at Presbyterian Manor
do not have cars and that not only they, but also other shoppers at Alfalfa’s would benefit from the
JUMP route along Arapahoe, between Broadway and 9th St..
Jeana Chleborad asked if during the construction sidewalk access would be impeded.
Ms. Stiffler replied that the city will keep the sidewalk open at all times during the construction, at least
on one side of the street, in the vicinity of the construction area.

Margarita Welgado stated that she does not drive and that the bus is the only way she can get to King
Soopers and other places in Boulder. She reiterated that the Route JUMP is a connection for residents at
the Manor and that most cannot afford Access-A-Ride or VIA services. Ms. Welgado added that the bus
should not be a luxury, but rather that it is a necessity.
Marty Patton stated that she appreciated RTD re-instating the JUMP LOOP after the original
consideration of discontinuation with the previous August 2017 service changes. She added that for the
City of Boulder, environmental sustainability is a significant goal and that bus service contributes to this.
She agreed that the suggested HOP reroute is a good option and would like to see the route on the
south side of the street, so that residents of the Manor could more easily access it. Ms. Patton asked
that RTD staff look at all potential reroute options during the construction, in order to allow service to
remain during the summer. In addition, she added that Boulder is experiencing an increase in senior
population and that RTD and the City should partner more on providing additional, affordable mobility
options for seniors. Ms. Stiffler responded that the City might be able to consider subsidizing services
such as Lyft and Uber, or perhaps VIA, through ‘buy-up’ type assistance.
Dan Winahr stated that if Route JUMP were to be removed from the ‘the LOOP’ then the City of Boulder
Main Branch Library would probably be the only library in the Denver Metro area without transit access.
Joel Gilbert stated he lives at 5th and Arapahoe and manages a Neighborhood EcoPass program. He said
that as best as he sees the situation, it appears the real issue is the construction and thus no service
option for Route JUMP west of 14th St. and Arapahoe, for the summer only. Mr. Gilbert added that he
understands the mobility issue presented by the residents of Presbyterian Manor and that the issue is
not the ‘Loop’ routing, but rather that residents are left without transit connections for that time period.
He added that the City and RTD should look into potential alternatives for residents, including potential
rerouting of current routes or other service options.
Natalie Stiffler (Separate communication) requested that RTD remove the proposed elimination of the
JUMP “west end loop” from the recommended May 2018 service changes and grant more time before
we make this change to the JUMP route.

6:00 PM
Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos, Tegan Rice and Diane Marquiss. There were 4 members of
the public including one Broomfield Staff member. No Board Members attended.
Steve Johnson asked if when CDOT completes roadwork if the 128 would be re-routed again. Nataly
responded that once the roadwork is completed, Service Development would wait a minimum of 6
months to consider any changes to the routing.
Mr. Johnson was also concerned about the 112 only running on the weekends, and the new routing
would potentially eliminate access to mid-way on Saturdays. He was wondering if potentially the
demand was more for the 128 if RTD would switch routes for operation on Saturdays. Nataly said that is
a possibility depending on where the demand is for Saturdays and/or Sundays. RTD staff will monitor the
ridership and service requests.
Mr. Johnson also asked what the changes were for the C-line. Staff explained that it was just a matter of
minor trip time adjustments and that there were no changes to occur to the frequency or service span.
Carl Crosswhite asked if the potential fare rate changes, which are currently being discussed, would
increase ridership and what the impacts for the routes might be. Staff responded that with the routing
change proposed an increase in ridership is anticipated and that any increase of ridership can be
accommodated with the current service levels, because current ridership is low on all 3 routes.
Bob Davis asked if there are any changes to the Access-a-Ride schedule. Staff responded that there
were no changes for that service.

attended.
Doug Monroe (RTD Service Planner/Scheduler, West Team Lead) started the meeting by introducing
himself and explaining the meeting’s purpose. He addressed several questions that those in attendance
had about proposed bus stop consolidations. He explained to all the basic rationale behind the
proposed stop consolidations: which are increased travel speed and increased schedule reliability for all
riders. He explained in certain instances bus stops were only a few hundred feet apart and/or used by
relatively few riders which had the effect of degrading service for many more on-board thru riders. He
also answered a question about the cost of closing bus stops.
Michael Thein said that commuter rail that currently operates only hourly should operate more
frequently instead at every 30 minutes. This would gain more riders. He said ‘Race for the Cure’ service

should remain and that low ridership last year was due to the weather. (Jessie Carter and Brian
Mathews explained that ‘Race for the Cure’ ridership over the last 6 years has been very low and well
below service standards).
Kevin Mooney said he used a wheelchair and that toilets at DUS and Downtown Boulder Station should
be able to be locked when in use. He said that the new Civic Center Station is very nice especially since
it included several well-located ADA door buttons. He also agreed with the proposed changes to routes
in the City of Broomfield. The commenter later said that he used a flashlight at light after dark to help
the driver see him waiting at his bus stop but that he still recently was passed-up at 95th & Arapahoe
after dark and had to wait for another hour. He also complained that elevators were recently out of
service at the US36 pedestrian bridge at Broomfield Station. (Doug Monroe explained that he could
phone customer care in these situations for assistance).
Helen Bushnell said the ‘Race for the Cure’ service should remain. She supported the changes proposed
in the City of Broomfield. She also said that she supported the route changes in the City of Broomfield.
She said in general that service change public hearings should have more explanation of the proposed
changes including slides. She said the proposed removal of so many bus stops was expensive for staff
and confusing to riders. She said that having extra bus stops near each other was a good backup if there
was nearby construction or snow at certain bus stops. Retaining bus stops was better for riders in
wheelchairs. She was also concerned about the proposed curtailment of a part of route #105, but later
withdrew that comment (Jessie Carter explained that only a small part of the route, south of Southmoor
Station, would actually see reductions).
Sharon Davis said that route #55L Eb trips, at 6:57a and 7:14a, often have standees which presents a
safety concern. She also said standees occur too often on the Wb trips at 4:10p and 4:25p. She
requested that larger buses be used. She also said that signs informing riders about bus stops being
eliminated should remain up longer after the stop is removed. (Doug Monroe explained that RTD sign
shop policy was to remove the notifications approximately 2 weeks after service has ended).
Leroy Robert said that route #43 and #12 buses that currently stop on street, near the 30th & Downing
Light Rail Station, should instead be routed to pull into the off-street bus area as they used to do several
years ago. This would promote better connections for riders, especially those using wheelchairs. (Jeff
Dunning explained that there few riders connected at 30th & Downing from the L-Line to route #43 as
#43 now already goes downtown obviating the need for that particular transfer). The commenter was
also concerned that route #12 buses block the traffic lane on Downing St. when serving riders at the
current on-street bus stop on Downing St adjacent to the Station. (Jessie Carter explained that the extra
time associated with pulling #43 and #12 buses into/out of the Station would require the cost of adding
an additional all-day bus into each of these routes to cover these routes’ schedules). The commenter
also said that route #28 should resume service east of Downtown on the weekends. Without that
service, he said he now must walk farther to MLK Blvd. to access route #43. (Jessie Carter explained that
route #28 service, east of Downtown, had been eliminated recently due to low ridership). The
commenter also said that L-Line frequencies should be increased in the evenings as service dropped
down to only every 30 minutes after 7.30p and is a very low level of service. The new L-Line now also
requires a transfer from 30th & Downing at all times to go farther south, and two transfers to go farther
south to Littleton on weekday evenings.
Michael Baily said that all of the proposed, and recent, bus stop closures are too many. In particular,
he said that recent closure of certain stops on route #20 near the hospital should be added back and

that the proposed reduction of certain trips should remain. He also said that the bus stop at 15th St &
Platte St. should be reinstated since there is nearby construction which prevents safe walking to the
next nearest bus stop. He said the City of Denver also does not plow the sidewalks of snow on 15th St on
the bridge over the Platte River. (Doug Monroe explained that the stop on 15th & Platte would be put
back along with the new adjacent development’s construction). The commenter also said that on route
#15 stops close to Downtown should remain since Colfax is such a well-used main bus street. On route
#10, the stops at Emerson and Ogden should remain and the proposed trip reduction should remain. On
route #12, the proposed frequency reduction south of Colfax should remain.
Dorothy Rice said that route #32 should operate more often on the weekends. This is because route
#28 no longer operates east of Downtown on the weekends. She also said that the new L-Line needs
more frequency and that it drops down to only every 30 minutes as early as 7.30p. She said that
previous D-Line trips could also be extended to 30th & Downing to increase service along Welton Ave.
She said that she lived near 20th Ave & Clarkson and that the area east of Downtown was now not
getting as much service as do areas served further to the east in Stapleton. She also commented that
the #16 bus stop at Colfax & Galapago should be retained, especially since it is not always safe to walk
farther alone along the street segment’s sidewalk.

Patrick Flanagan said that the Call-n-Ride in Broomfield was working well for him and appreciated the
service.

Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter and Brian Matthews. There were 5 members of the public
including one Broomfield Staff member. No Board Members attended.
Lee Jacobson & Zach Bushay are opposed to the elimination of the Route 10- bus stop at 12th Avenue and
Pennsylvania Street stating that is a busy stop and 12th & Washington is not as busy. The also stated that
there are seniors in the building at this stop and discontinuing the bus stop would cause stress. There
were 2 people who voice their concern on this stop discontinuance.
Carol Streamer is supportive of the proposal to add trips on the Route 3L and would like to see a trip
added in the early afternoon. She also mentioned how difficult it was to travel from Windsor Gardens to
Boulder using the transit system
Ginger Montoya was concerned about her stop being eliminated on the Route 83L. (Her stop was not on

Five members of the public were in attendance, along with Jessie Carter from RTD staff.
Lisa Lamunyon had questions about the seemingly variable routing of the Route 83D and the use of 8th
Avenue to get to Speer Boulevard. (Jessie Carter explained that the routing had recently been changed
and some operators may be using the old routing).
Sharon Williams noted that she and her husband selected Denver over Portland, Oregon for retirement,
based largely on the transit system. She applauded RTD for the growth of bus and rail systems.
Donald Scanlon opposes the changes proposed for the Route 169L. He and his wife both use the 169L to
access Denver International Airport and truly appreciate the ability to use their Senior discounted local
fare to do so. He has used the 169 to access the 40th Avenue & Airport Blvd Station to transfer to the
University of Colorado A Line and wondered if we would consider routing the 169L into this station,
allowing then to transfer for a local fare. (Jessie responded by say that they could use the 169 to transfer
to the 169L on-street to the same effect as his request.)
Sheila Scanlon asked if she could have more information on what would be the most cost effective fare
type to use to access DEN? (Jessie gave Mr. and Mrs. Scanlon his contact information for further
assistance on itineraries and fare information).
David Kelley stated that he was in opposition of the removal of the stop at 12th Ave – Pennsylvania
stating that he sees it as being very busy. He also stated that the eastbound 12th Avenue-Pennsylvania is
not as accessible to him, so he could see that stop being eliminated in favor of the stop at Washington
Street. (Jessie informed him that he was not alone in requesting the stop be maintained and that staff
was considering retaining the stop).

Additional Comments
Please do not reduce rush hour frequency on the 12 line. It doesn't
make a lot of sense to reduce service with all of the new residents
moving in, especially at the Country Club towers, which are right on
the 12 line.
I am inclined to opposed the proposed midday frequency
reduction for Route 62. First, how long has this route been
in operation? I would think it should require at least a year
to allow potential passengers to become aware of and use
the route. Also, it's my understanding that this route is
funded by a CMAQ grant, and therefore cutting service
doesn't result in any financial savings to the District, as
the unused grant money must be returned to the federal
government.
I have just noticed the proposed change to Route 169L (to be
effective 20 May 2018) and offer the following comments. It is my
intention to attend the public meeting for Southeast Denver at
Calvary Baptist Church at 6:00 pm on Thursday, 1 March 2018.
PLEASE do NOT change the origin and termination point (opposite
Regis Jesuit HS on Lewiston St in Aurora) of the Route 169L bus.
While I acknowledge that few riders begin and end at that
terminus, my wife and I do regularly catch the Route 169L bus at
the Buckley Rd/Caley St stop as we make our way to DIA. The trip
takes just under an hour, is essentially a direct travel trip for us and
allows us to walk to/from the bus stop. Riding the 169 bus (rather
than the 169L bus) does offer more time opportunities but we then
must walk from the bus to the Light Rail Station at 40th/Airport,
and wait for the "A" train to get to DIA. Thank you. DL Scanlon
I would like to request that further adjustments be made to
accommodate late westbound A Line trains attempting to make a B
Line connection during evening rush hour at Union Station. The A
Line continues to run late and cause extended waits at Union
Station for cross-town commuters trying to catch the B Line headed
to Westminster Station with no other alternate routes to
Westminster Station.
I wanted to ask that when you are looking at minor schedule
adjustments for the 0 and late 15, please consider the arrival time
of inbound A line trains to Union Station from the airport. I work at
DIA and am off work usually in time for the 12:27am departure
from DIA, which arrives a few minutes after 1am at Union. Every
night I catch either the 0 or 15 from there up to Colfax/Broadway or
Colfax/Grant-Sherman, so I'm hoping the timing for that connection
will stay good with any minor changes that you feel may need to
happen. That late at night it's no fun waiting another 30 mins for
the next bus.
My name is Sarah and I work on the Amazon Ride team, specifically
with sites in the west, including Colorado. There is a relatively new
Amazon site in Aurora that has asked how to go about making a
request for improved transit service. Do you know who I may be
able to speak with at RTD to learn more about service change
requests?

Thanks for the great drivers and reliable 120x, 122x. service. I ride
RTD and from work almost every day. I love to ride the B line…but
the service is too infrequent for my work schedule. One must-do if
you cancel the Rockies Ride service… Increase the B Line service to
Westminster!!! We get the least rail service of any line in town,
and ridership is above what was predicted!
Please make it every 15 minutes during rush hour and at least 30
minutes other times. For Rockies fans, trying to catch the train
ONLY available on the hour is a horrible, unnecessary sacrifice,
definitely NOT FAIR, since riders on all other lines have many more
time options. We’re the last to get any rail or Fastracks anyway, at
least treat us like we matter as much as everybody else in town.
Good morning...I just want to say thank you for increasing the
tubes the C-line Runs; however it seems not smart to reduce the
cars to 2-cars especially at peak times. This morning starting at
mineral both cars were packed before we even left the station... By
Englewood it was ridiculous It would be nice to see three cars
during peak times Thank you for your consideration Margie

I've been a daily rider and EcoPass owner for over three years. I
immediately started using RTD light rail when I moved here
because, as a professional urban planner, I truly believe that good
public transit is one of the most impactful and useful services a city
can have. I love that Denver has rail transit. I have worked in other
cities promoting the re-introduction of rail transit, and I understand
both its cost and its capacity to spur development and make a
difference in the lives of people in the community. It has been very
exciting to see the RTD network expand so meaningfully over the
short time that I have lived here, and I look forward to the plans
that you have for the future. That said, I really don't understand
the service changes that you made for the C and D lines in January.
I read your blurb about both, and it still makes little sense. You had
reliable 15(ish) minute headways on the D line and similar service
during rush hour on the C line. Service was predictable and
intuitive, and it seemed to synchronize well with bus connections.
Honestly, service from south Denver/Englewood into central
downtown (where I would argue most people want to go) was
exactly what a commuter would dream of. Now you have what
feels like a jumbed mess between 8am and 10am: 10-15 minute
headways for the C line, half hour headways for the D line, except
at one point you go down to 10 minute headways, then all of the
sudden the rhythm shifts and you have pockets where no trains
come and people stand around for twenty to thirty minutes with no
trains. Then after rush hour (especially in the evenings) service
drops considerably, which has a pretty massive impact on the
service industry and student population (especially working
students who take night classes) that rely on the trains out of
downtown at night. It just feels like the ACTUAL level of service (not
the efficiency on paper) has dropped considerably from what it was
a month and a half ago. I know the process for service changes
usually involves a team of engineers analyzing ridership and cost
data and spitting out suggestions for the most efficient schedule.
What I also know is that these sorts of processes (and lets be real,
people - engineers aren't the most common-sense driven or
creative problem solvers) can leave out the notion that a good
public transit system is simple, reliable, and easy to navigate for the
daily commuter and visitor alike. In this case it just seems like you
guys have made the schedules way too convoluted and
complicated, and it shows in the number of riders just standing
around for extended periods of time, going back and forth reading
the schedules waiting for their next train. It's been over a month,
and it still seems like people are trying to figure out what's going
on, which I think is an indication that your schedule changes didn't
quite accomplish what you thought they would. It also seems like
your drivers are struggling, too. I get on northbound trains at the
Evans station, which isn't too far from the beginning of the line, yet

the trains are consistently several minutes late. You also talked
about how you made the trains longer, as in more cars per train.
Sometimes that's true, but in a handful of situations, D line trains
have only two cars. What this looks like is loads of freezing cold
people who have been stuck on a platform in the snow for half an
hour cramming into two standing room only train cars during rush
hour. I'm a young adult man, so I have no problem standing on the
train - in fact I just do it anyway even if there are open seats - but it
becomes a hazard when you have people with children and the
elderly/less physically able standing in the slippery wet aisles while
the drivers consistently take turns way too quickly and repeatedly
slam on their brakes or accellerate more aggressively than is really
necessary. Again, the numbers might say one thing, but common
sense and actually considering what would be best for your riders
would likely say another. For whatever it's worth, I hope that
someone actually sees this message for what it is: thoughtful
feedback from a transit rider who pays attention and has at least
half a clue as to what he's talking about. Admittedly I wrote in on
your comment form this morning (after standing around in the cold
for twenty minutes more than I planned and being late for work)
and was much more emotional and less thoughtful about my choice
of words. I apologize for that, and I hope that this longer, more
civil, and more constructive message makes up for what I would
describe as "bitching" in my previous comment submission.

Someone really thought that stopping D line service at 9:30 at the
Performing Arts Complex was a good idea? Have you guys ever
been out there when all the shows let out at once? And now you
expect all of us, including elderly theater patrons to squeeze on an
H line? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!

My name is Amanda Brenner, and I'm 33 years old. I do
not own a car, and I rely on RTD for a lot of my
transportation needs. I like to think that I pay attention to
service changes and that I ride enough to be cognizant of
them. I was caught off guard last Friday, however. I
usually take the light rail to go downtown during the day,
but my wife and I had planned a night out downtown with
friends last Friday. We like to take RTD downtown on
weekend evenings so that we don't have to look for a
parking spot or pay for parking. I have been taking the
train from Englewood station long enough that I thought I
knew that we should catch the 7:12 D line to meet our
friends on time. But there was no 7:12 D line, and taking
the C line and transferring would have added 20+ minutes
to our trip. We ended up driving and paying for parking,
then I had to sneak out of the performance we were
attending so I could feed the meter when our time ran out.
I have so many problems with this experience. First of all,
if I didn't catch that service had changed, then it wasn't
advertised well. This is a problem. I don't think I should
have to look on the website or app to plan every single trip
I make with RTD. Secondly, the lack of night service on
the D line now is utterly appalling. Yes, in the best case
scenario, it will only add five minutes to your trip. Worst
case scenario, it could add 20-30 minutes. By limiting D
line service and inconveniencing people who were used to
this rather convenient line from the middle of downtown
to the south suburbs, I think this will encourage people to
drive more, especially on weekend nights when they might
be imbibing in controlled substances. I would really
appreciate some compensation for my experience on
Friday night. It was quite stressful to change plans on a
dime like we were forced to, and I am out a light rail pass
as I had validated a pass from a book of 10 local passes
before I learned that the train I wanted wasn't coming. If
RTD continues to make decisions contrary to the needs of
its customers in this manner, you will have lost a lifelong
rider, and I'm sure my friends and acquaintances on my
social media accounts would love to know about this as
well.
Friday night at 10:25 PM I took the H Line north bound from the
Theatre District/Convention Ctr Station to loop back around. There
were just a few passengers on the train. When the train left the
Theatre District/Convention Ctr Station it was jammed packed. My
suggestion, if you aren't going to extended the hours of the south
bound D Line, is that you add extra cars to the H Line to
accommodate theatre attendees, theatre employees and others
going south bound for an additional hour past the time the theatres
let out. This is especially going to be needed when Hamiliton plays
here in Denver.
I would like to complain about the services changes that were made
to the D line. The D trains are packed and the C trains are empty. I
hope this will be re-evaluated when changes are made in May.
why you cut service so much -- we can't even catch a D line after
930 PM or so, and the C Line is every half hour -- connection times
are distressing because it's often an almost half hour wait at
Broadway Station. I got off work last night and made it to the
station in time for the H train at 10:25 PM, which arrived at
Broadway Station at 1037, and had to wait for the C Line which
didn't arrive until 1107! That's really bad. Could something be
done so that a trip home which used to take around 25 minutes can
be restored somehow? It usually takes an hour to get home now.

Why did you change the D schedule so drastically? We have had
the D line to Littleton since July 14, 2000, that is nearly 18 years.
With absolutely no notification you totally disregarded getting to
and from Littleton and the Theater District and Convention Center
or downtown. It now takes an hour after 9:38 PM to get to
Littleton, because the there a 30 minutes wait at the Broadway
station for the next C train. There are three ways you could make it
better. Put on more D trains which would be the easiest for all the
riders south, both the Englewood station and the 2 Littleton
stations have a lot of riders. The other two suggestions is to change
both the H and C schedules so that the wait to transfer trains at
Broadway would be 5 to 7 minutes. Or have both H and C
scheduled every 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes. With 18 years of
dependable transportation by light rail taken away is a very sad
situation for all the people who depended on a great transportation
along the D line
Yesterday, we were waiting for more than 30 minutes we finally
took the H line. It took us one hour and half to get home out
Theatre District Convention Center Station. There is no new
schedule out Littleton Station or out of the Convention Station.
How are we suppose to get home. I would like my voice to be
heard.
e use the D line a lot between Evans Station and the
Convention Center/DCPA. All of a sudden, we don't have
a convenient and comfortable trip -- unless we leave the
symphony, which starts at 730 PM tonight -- before it's
over, to get back. The last D line is 929 PM, and trying to
connect with the C line, it's a half hour wait! This is a
complaint; I don't understand what RTD is doing, unless
you're trying to discourage people from using the rail.
I have been riding the D-Line from Evans Station to Theater District
Station. We have used this service allot in the past because it was
very convenient and reliable. With your service change, it is not
working well for people who use this because of all the cut times.
We now have to transfer and your connections do not work well.
For example, if I caught the first train after 11:00pm which is the HLine at 11:55pm and I transfer to the C-Line at Broadway it does not
connect. The connections are incredibly inconvenient.
I am reaching out to share that the recent schedule changes are
adversely affecting my light rail commute to/from Denver Center
for the Performing Arts (DCPA) via the Convention Center station.
For example, the last D Line departure at 9:38pm Friday is not late
enough for some shows. Could RTD please consider adding at least
one more D Line departure after 10:00pm on Fridays and Saturdays
to accommodate DCPA patrons?
Your changes to the D Line is not very good for those who
go to the theatre district. There is still so many things
going on in this area that the last train south bound is not
late enough. You have made it very inconvenient to travel
back down to Littleton.
We need more FF4s in the morning. Right now, the 7:17 and 7:24
end up being standing room only by Broomfield or completely full.
We need another option! There are 5 routes that go to Union
Station, but only one that goes to Civic Center Station! That is
ridiculous. We need more options! I would like to know when you
will be adding more buses or fixing this problem. RTD needs to
improve customer satisfaction!
Good morning. I am riding on this mornings 7:30 FF7. I am
one of 11 people standing due to the size of the bus. I feel
like the FF7 should always have a large bus. There are
consistently people standing during certain times... thanks

Thanks for the great service you provide! I just wanted to
encourage you to not change the JUMP route west of 14th st. I rely
on the JUMP to get to work at 1101 Arapahoe. Getting off at 14th
isn’t a huge nuisance for me, but I would prefer the bus to stay on
the same route.
It appears that the L line serves no real purpose besides delaying
the arrival of other trains. The L train rarely has more than a few
riders, but its arrival at the Stout station delays the arrival of the H
Line by several minutes and seems to throw a wrench in the rest of
the trip. After leaving late due the the L Line, the H Line made
several other mid point stops for no apparent reason and was
delayed arriving at 9 Mile. Please get rid of the L Line.
Shock yet another accident downtown which delays all those trains
so if you decrease the r line, aurora residents which rtd doesnt care
about to begin with that work downtown would be even more
delayed having to transfer and wait for later trains without the R
line. It would also delay you're oh so precious airport riders, the
only riders you care about. It's not enough you've ruined the r line
schedule with you're adjustments to accommodate a line people,
now r line riders that have to make transfers to other rtd crap
services up to if not longer than 30 minutes which as today in the
negative degree weather is just great. But as you never listen to
riders nor reply to emails I know this like all other communication
will go ignored.
The January 2018 schedule changes have had significantly negative
impacts on transportation service. Southbound rail services out of
the downtown loop are overwhelmed with riders. Sometimes riders
are unable to board a train because it is so crowded, with people
completely filling the isles and stairwells, many without access to a
secure handhold while riding, resulting in minor injuries when an
operator makes a hard stop. With the reduction in service intervals
on rails out of downtown, people are forced to stand in the harsh
cold waiting for a train, crowding the sidewalks, attracting the
homeless community, and many time not being able to board the
next train due to overcrowding. Elderly are unable to sit and
wheelchairs are completely unable to board. Public transportation
is many people's only commuting option, and these recent changes
are doing them and every other contributing tax payer a massive
disservice. The current operation is unsafe, ineffective, and
generally unacceptable and must not be allowed to continue. I have
photos of the current riding conditions that I can provide upon
request.
I have appreciated using RTD when I have needed it. I commute
from Longmont to the Denver VA Hospital. Due to the 2.5 hour, and
bus change/wait, I only take the bus when I really need to. I am
anticipating the move to the new facility in Aurora later this year.
My commute will lengthen to 42 miles each way. Is there any way
that a new route could be established? A direct route from
Interstate 25 and Highway 119 to the Aurora Medical complex, that
includes the VA hospital, Childrens Hospital and University? I
would really like to ride a direct bus from Longmont. There are a
number of professionals that make the commute. I do work 10
hour shifts with very rigid start and finish times.

He is concerned that the stop going to be closed and inquired on
how the stops closures are determined and if there was anything
that could be done to prevent the stop closure. This stop is most
convenient for the passenger and residents in the area

I am very disheartened to see the proposal to remove the stops at
exposition and S. Zuni streets for the route 11. These are the stops I
use to get from home to the lightrail station, and will negatively
impact my commute and mobility. Please reconsider.

Since most likely I will not be able to attend any of the announced/
scheduled 'in-person' public meetings (to discuss the various
changes to bus routes/ schedules/ stops, etc...), I am writing here
to include my comment (as the "Proposed May 2018 Service
Changes" information flyer indicates that we may comment via
email -- and "no later than March 2, 2018"). Specifically, I wish to
discuss the proposed closure/ elimination of the following bus
stops:
Eastbound at 12th Ave. and Pennsylvania St. (Stop #10177)
Westbound at 12th Ave. and Pennsylvania St. (Stop #10178)
I happen to live very close to those particular stops -- and regularly
use them to ride the #10 bus. Additionally, I often do see quite a
few other local residents/ individuals utilize them, as well (during
the morning rush hour, as well as at various times throughout the
day)... Therefore, I feel that such a change would prove to be an
inconvenience to those "regular" riders (whose ride/s "begin" and
"end" at those stops). However, if it is ultimately determined that
these bus stops will indeed be "shut down" in May of 2018 (even
though they have been/ remained there for so many years),
hopefully I (as well as my fellow riders) will be able to board the
#10 bus from the remaining nearby locations (namely, Eastbound at
12th Ave. and Washington St. -- and Westbound at 12th Ave. and
Grant St.) -- and that those stops will remain 'intact'... I thank you
in advance for your time, attention, and consideration regarding
this matter.

I have recently learned that RTD is proposing removal of 4 stops on
the 11 route in the Athmar Park neighborhood where I reside.
These stops at Exposition Ave. & S. Zuni St. and Exposition Ave. and
S. Federal Blvd serve a great deal of my community and enhance
the mobility of our residents, particular the elderly and disabled
where an additional 2 blocks of walking or wheel-chair rolling can
have a severe impact on their ability to arrive on-time or at all.
These stops are also on primary intersections of the neighborhood
where the majority of traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, are utilizing
the area. These stops are sensible and well-placed. Their removal
creates a gap in the transit network of our neighborhood. It is also
that when someone is not present at the stop or a passenger is not
requesting a stop at one of them, they are then "on-demand", only
used as needed. It seems insensible to remove them, when they
currently serve their function only when needed. It is already very
efficient in that manner and their removal only burdens your
customers, and my community. Please reconsider their removal
and continue to serve our neighborhood with the interest of our
residents.
I ride the #10 west bound from stop #21039 at 12th and Ogden. I
do not agree with your proposal of eliminating this stop. It is
heavily used, and would be and inconvenience.
Discontinuing the Pennsylvania stops on route #10 will
cause a hardship for me. I use the bus frequently and have
a chronic disease making walking an extra 2 blocks
difficult.
Colfax & Reed west bound is a late night wheel chair handicap stop

My comment concerns the southbound re-routing from
Downing Street and 18th Ave to 19th Ave and Ogden St.
First, I'd like to remind staff and the RTD Board that the
current southbound Route 12 makes a stop on Downing St
just north of 18th Ave, which allows passengers to
transfer to Route 20 westbound. With the proposed
rerouting, this stop would presumably be discontinued.
The next Route 12 stop is on Ogden St north of 17th Ave,
closer to Route 20 eastbound. I would support this
rerouting if provision were made to provide a bus stop on
Ogden St, probably north of 18th Ave and Park Ave, that
would continue to allow a convenient transfer to Route 20
westbound. A new stop on 19th Ave near Ogden Street
would be less preferred.
I take this bus Monday - Friday to get to work. I have to
transfer to the #76 north bound. As you know
Wadsworth Blvd & West Colfax is an EXTREMELY BUSY
intersection. If you are trying to get the connection from
#16 westbound to #76 northbound and you eliminate the
West Colfax / Wadsworth Blvd nearside stop it can take
up to 5 minutes to LEGALLY & SAFELY get across
Wadsworth Blvd if you see the #76 northbound bus
coming. This will force RTD bus patrons to either RISK
THEIR LIFE AND ILLEGALLY RUN ACROSS WADSWORTH
AGAINST THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL IN ORDER TO GET THE
#76 northbound bus to get to work OR MISS THE BUS
AND HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 30 MINUTES FOR THE
NEXT #76 northbound bus and get to work late every day
and risk losing their job.
hank you,
Richard a very concerned OLDER PERSON who only wants
to get to work SAFELY each day and not have to risk my
life to get the RTD bus connection to get to work.
I live along the 10 route. I am very discouraged to see the proposed
elimination of so many stops. The one thing that is nice about the
current route is that it has always been convenient and not like an
Limited or Express route. Specifically, I am impacted by the
elimination of the stops at 12th and Pennsylvania. These stops
serve a high-density population, as well as two nearby Bed and
Breakfast businesses, not to mention the Molly Brown house one
block to the north. I am also concerned about the elimination of
the stops at 12th and Ogden/Emerson. The eastbound stop is the
most convenient stop to walk to transfer to the southbound 12.
Otherwise, one has to exit at the Corona stop and cross Corona to
go back to the 12 stop, increasing the danger of riders running
across a busy one-way street to make a close connection. Overall, I
hate to see RTD make changes that discourage ridership,
particularly in the Capitol Hill neighborhood where there is a highdensity population, including elderly and physically-compromised
riders and school children. For these riders, to have to walk another
two or three blocks may make an RTD trip impractical. (Also, I have
always thought that an additional stops between Corona and
Humboldt Streets would be helpful). Perhaps RTD would consider
adding a rush-hour Limited route with fewer stops to streamline
the trip for commuters, but leave the local 10 in tact.

I believe RTD is proposing to remove several stops in the Athmar
Park neighborhood. I ride the 11 often, coming home from work.
The stops that are targeted for removal are not my stops, but I
don’t see why you need to eliminate them. I mean, if no one wants
to be picked up or dropped off, then it doesn't slow the bus down
at all, since it doesn't stop. If someone does need to
embark/disembark, well, then, the stop is ipso facto useful, and a
stop adds only like 30 seconds to the route time (compared to the
amount of time it would take someone to walk the extra blocks to a
still-viable stop). Are you guys trying to save maintenance costs of
the extra stops? Because I don’t know the potentially-removed
stops so well, but I know that at my own stop (Shoshone and
Exposition), there isn’t much—if any—maintenance done. I would
really like to hear the reasons for removing an on-demand bus stop.
Especially since presumably, you guys did some research at one
point and decided that it was a good place for a bus stop. What has
changed? Denver has enough problems with mass transit. The 14,
which I usually take in to work, only runs every half hour. We
should be expanding routes and stops to make it easier to catch a
bus, not harder! I hope you will reconsider making bus travel even
more difficult (and dangerous, in the winter! Have you seen
Athmar’s sidewalks?!).
I am confused on the stops you want to eliminate on
Route 6. Your system map online shows the 6 has an
eastbound stop at Vine St., not Gaylord St. Do you mean
you want to eliminate the eastbound stop at Vine St.? Or
is the stop now at Gaylord St. and your system map is
wrong? Either way, eliminating whichever stop is there
now along with the York stop (which probably is a waste,
as I know the 15 never stopped both at York and
Josephine) will leave the public with no stop for 6 blocks.
That is way too long to maneuver when your a senior with
bags your carrying down the not so great side walk. With
the numbet of older homes and older riders in this area, I
would like to see you keep a stop every 3 blocks. For the
same reason, if you eliminate the eastbound stop at
Dexter, you leave 5 blocks without a stop from Clermont
to Elm St, which is too far to walk for me. Also,
eliminating the eastbound and westbound Empire stops
leaves no stop for 5 blocks between Dayton and Fulton. I
can live without the eastbound and westbound stops at
Abilene and Bayaud as long as the 6 still stops just after
taking the left turn on Alameda past TGIFridays going
eastbound and the Alameda and Sable stop going
westbound. Again eliminating the westbound Lowry Blvd
and Spruce stop leaves 5 blocks with no stop from
Rampart to Rosemary. Also, eliminating the westbound
Vine stop leaves 5 blocks with no stop between Josephine
and High. Thank You for considering my concerns on
Route 6 changes.

I feel you should keep stops that when removed leave 5 or more
blocks without a stop. Us seniors have a hard enough time walking
on uneven sidewalks carrying our purchases without making the
walk even longer. Therefore, I don't want you to eliminate the
eastbound and westbound stops at Mississippi and Milwaukee Way
as that leaves no stop between Elizabeth and Steele. I wouldn't
want you to eliminate the westbound stop at Mississippi Ave. and
Garfield St. as that would leave 5 blocks without a stop between
Colorado Blvd and Madison St. I am OK with you eliminating the
eastbound stop of the same. I believe it is too far to walk if you
eliminate both the eastbound and westbound stops at S. Kearney
St. and Tennessee Ave. and the stop at Mississippi Ave. and
Kearney St. I believe you should only eliminate one of those stops
and keep one of the 2 stops. If you eliminate the eastbound stop at
Mississippi Ave. and Kingston St., you leave 5 blocks from Joliet to
Moline without a stop, which is too far for me to walk. Also, the
sidewalk ends at Kingston, I believe, which would make it even
more difficult. The westbound stop at Mississippi Ave. and Lansing
St. should not be eliminated as that would leave 5-6 blocks without
a stop between Moline St. and Kenton Way. On an extra note, my
mom's house is right on Florida Ave. However, there are no buses
on Florida Ave. So I have to walk 5 more blocks south after I get off
of 11 on Mississippi Ave. just to get to Florida on top of you trying
to eliminate the closest Mississippi stop there is. Also, I can not see
you eliminating both westbound stops at W. Mississippi Ave. and S.
Teller St. and the W. Mississippi Ave. and S. Vance St. That would
leave 5 blocks from S. Reed St. to Wadsworth Blvd without a stop. I
would like to see you keep one of these stops either at Teller or
Vance.
I use RTD transit to travel to work, and I noticed a proposal to
eliminate a few of the stops I frequently use. The stop at 14th and
Irving is how I'm able to get to the library and is used by a lot of
other riders. Also Colfax and Perry is a stop I like because it is at a
stop light with a cross signal, so getting across Colfax is less
treacherous. Colfax and Quitman is right next to it and is only used
now as a substitute for Perry because of construction. Please do
not get rid of these stops as I use them almost every day. Thank
you.
A bus stop at Mississippi & Teller St is set to be closed as
part of the May 2018 changes. This would be a great
inconvenience for me and I can only imagine others as
well. That stop is the closest stop to the elementary
school there (Emory Elementary). Why not close the stop
at Mississippi & Reed St since it is so close to the stop at
Pierce? The Teller stop is a better middle point between
the Pierce stop and the Wadsworth stop.
I would really appreciate it if you guys didn't get rid of the Quebec
Way and Florida Ave Nearside stop in May. My mother uses a
walker and it would make it very hard for her to walk further to the
next stop.
Evans and Lafayette - Why would you get rid of this stop?
It doesn't make sense as to why you guys would eliminate
the only stop that is right in front of this elementary
school. Now these kids have to walk three blocks for the
next stop! This is a safety risk to these kids! It's also right
in front of a grocery store, you're telling me that I have to
walk three blocks with my grocery bags? What about the
disabled? I am blind and now I have to walk further to get
to the next stop and to drop off my kids at the stop. This
is not okay. Please reconsider it, and keep this stop.
12th & Pennsylvania - I would like to file a complaint
about you guys trying to take away this stop. This is a VA
route. This would make it a really long walk from Grant to
Washington, to get to the next stop. This is my complaint
please do not take these stops away, we need them.

Please don't close this stop.
It's literally right outside my office front door and it has a
bench.
If I had to walk two blocks after a long work day, then not
being able to catch the 505pm... Watching that 505pm
number 6 fly by as I waddled as fast as a can, would
suck..
I wouldn't connect with the 607pm number 8 downtown
and that would mean my disabled backside would have to
stand around downtown for and additional hour and
twelve minutes waiting for the next 8.
Please don't close #25231
I would like you all to consider leaving the stop at
Louisiana Ave and Pearl St (next to 7-11). I am a frequent
rider and am also blind. I would find it more difficult and
unsafe to cross and board over at the actual station,
should this stop be removed.
In my experience 3 times as many riders get on and off at
Lipan and 38th going westbound than they do at that dark
spot at Kalamath and 38th. I would rather see you
eliminate Kalamath stop and keep the well lit Lipan stop in
front of the 7-Eleven. Also, the Benton and 38th stop has
the shelter and is closest to the King Soopers for all of us
who are handicapped and need easy access to the grocery
store with our walkers and carts. I believe you should keep
the Benton stop in both directions for us shoppers. The
22nd and Blake stop is used when the Rockies have a
home game a lot. By employees of Coors Field and the
fans. I propose that you keep stopping there when there is
home games at Coors Field. There must be some way you
can accommodate the people attending the games when a
portion of the sales tax that is collected on sales at Coors
Field goes to RTD.
I just wanted to reach out. I'm actually super for the effort
to reduce stops I think this is exactly what is needed to
improve the system. I might make one change
recommendation on the 10. Its not my personal stop but I
notice significantly more people board the westbound 10
at 12th and Pennsylvania than I do at the 12th and
Washington stop. It might make more sense to close the
Washington stop than the Pennsylvania stop.

According to RTD service standards, the desired stop spacing for
local routes is one-quarter mile. I would encourage you to apply
this standard flexibly, considering such factors as intersecting
routes, intersection geometrics, intersection signal programming,
surrounding development and route spacing. You might also wish
to use a moving average technique to identify sections where stops
are spaced too closely. Some Board members have expressed
frustration about "buses stopping every two blocks." I would like to
remind them (and you) that for some sections of numbered
avenues - such as from 80th Avenue to 88th Avenue - avenues are
spaced eight to a mile. For such locations, every two blocks is
precisely the desired spacing. In contrast, there are 16 named
streets between Washington Street (700 East) and York Street
(2300 East). In this case, the desired spacing is every four blocks.
Thank you for being responsive to public requests to maintain more
closely spaced stops to serve individuals with mobility limitations.
Some larger intersections - such as Colorado and Alameda, or
Wadsworth and Belleview - might be around 150 to 200 feet to
cross. Also keep in mind that traffic signal cycles at such
intersections may be as long as 150 seconds - 2.5 minutes.
Depending on stop placement and bus arrival time, there might be
a 5 minute difference in the time required to transfer at such
intersections, if a rider has to first wait for the bus to get the green
light, and then cross from a far side stop. I would encourage
retaining both near-side and far-side stops at such locations - and
even on routes serving minor streets that cross such wide arterials,
for example, the Route 34 on Bruce Randolph Avenue crossing
Colorado Blvd. Finally, keep in mind that some north-south routes
are spaced as much as a mile and a half apart. This occurs between
Route 76 (Wadsworth) and Route 52 (Sheridan), Route 52 and
Route 31 (Federal), Route 24 (University/York) and Route 40
(Colorado), and Route 73 (Quebec) and Route 105 (Havana). People
wishing to access such routes may be already walking 3/4 to a full
mile before reaching the major north-south arterial. Since research
shows that bus ridership drops dramatically once passengers have
to walk more than a quarter mile to reach a stop, it would be
advantageous not to require such passengers to walk great
distances on the north-south arterials.
I oppose eliminating the stops (each direction) at 8550 Lowry Blvd.
These stops serve the Big Bear ice arena, and were the stops I used
when I played in a recreational hockey league there. While these
stops are about 0.2 miles from the stops at the Unita Way
roundabout, eliminating them would create a distance of about
0.45 to 0.5 miles to the next set of stops at the Yosemite
roundabout. If you're not familiar, I'd like to remind you that a
hockey bag can be about the size of checked airport luggage. A
goalie's bag can be even larger. These are bulky items, and benefit
from more convenient access to the ice rink. and while league
games are typically scheduled only once a week, I'd also like to
remind you that if no passenger requests a stop, then there is no
delay to the bus. Also, as your own Trailblazer cites, "Our
Passengers are not an interruption of our work, they are the
purpose of it."
You need to keep the Route 10 bus stops at • 12th Ave. and
Pennsylvania St
because it is front of a 20 story high rise building (Penn Square)
with many residents who use the bus, and several of us who are
disabled. I use a wheelchair and others use walkers. We will not be
able to get to the nearest remaining bus stop if this change is made.

I'm sending thus email requesting that the above mentioned bus
stops to not be discontinued. There are many individuals who live
at Penn Square and surrounding neighborhood who use these bus
stops. Included among those users are several disabled and elderly
persons. Another fact that may not have been considered is that
the East bound stop at Washington St which is being kept is at the
bottom of a hill. In the winter on many occasions a bus becomes
stuck there due to having to start from a stopped position at the
base of the hill.
Please keep the stop at 550 E 12th ave................many residents of
this high rise use this stop. THANK YOU,
I am a resident in Penn Square, a 20-story high rise on the corner of
12th and Pennsylvania. I am writing to protest the elimination of
the bus stop in front of this building (east bound) as well as the one
on the northwest corner (west bound). There are a number of
handicapped and elderly residents in this building who use RTD –
it’s the only transportation they have. This change will be very
detrimental to them. Please take into consideration this concern.

Financial Impact
The increased cost of the CBA for 2018 ($17 million) has been included in the previously Board
Approved 2018 Budget.
The negotiated additional cost for 2019 ($22,300,000) and 2020
($29,300,000) will require an adjustment to the 2019-2024 SBP/APE.

Alternatives
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute a new three (3) year RTD and ATU Division
1001 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) effective March 1, 2018 – February 28, 2021 for
all represented RTD employees.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager to execute the new CBA and instead require the General
Manager to continue negotiations. This is not recommended. The RTD and ATU have engaged in
good faith negotiations and have reached a tentative agreement. Rejection by the Board would
damage morale and would likely not result in further negotiations. The option would be to go to
interest arbitration, which leaves the decision in the hands of a third party. This most likely
would be more costly to RTD.
