## II. March Board Meeting Agenda Review

First Vice-Chair Menten reviewed the agenda for the February 27, 2018, Board Meeting.

John McKay, Board Office Administrator, stated that Sheri Le, RTD’s Cyber Security Manager, would likely be bringing her son to lead the pledge.

First Vice Chair Menten asked whether Ms. Le’s son would be leading a flag ceremony.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that only scouting groups would be posting the colors rather than individuals.

First Chair Menten spoke about agenda item regarding the installation of the Director Designate for District N, Peggy Catlin.

Ms. McManus responded that the Board Office would not have the official documentation for Ms. Catlin’s appointment until at least Tuesday, March 20. She said that Mr. McKay and she would work to attain that documentation so that Ms. Catlin could be sworn in by Rolf Asphaug, RTD General Council, on the night of the Board Meeting of March 27, 2018.

Director Lubow asked whether the Board would have to wait another week if the Director were not sworn in on March 27.

Ms. McManus said that Directors must be installed at a Board Meeting. She said a Special Board Meeting could either be added to a meeting already scheduled in April or be scheduled on a different day.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked the cause of the delay.

Ms. McManus explained that the Board of County Commissioners for Jefferson County had selected Ms. Catlin on March 9 but would not be able to officially adopt a resolution of appointment until March 20. She said that the Board could not proceed to install Ms. Catlin unless the Board Office was in the possession of the official documentation.

First Vice-Chair Menten reiterated that the installation of Ms. Catlin was tentative. She asked how many retirees would be in attendance.

General Manager Genova replied that Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, would attend, and he asked if any others had responded.

Mr. McKay responded that Mr. Emmons was the only retiree who had responded to the Board Office at that time.

Director Menten asked whether the committee was aware of anyone from the public who would be speaking during the public participation segment.

Ms. McManus said she had heard that representatives from 9to5 Colorado were encouraging public comment regarding the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) recommendation. She said that Mr. McKay was working with Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, to ensure that information regarding the timeline for the review and consideration of the PPWG proposal, as well as any opportunities for public comment, would be posted on the relevant page on the RTD website. She said she suspected that the Board would hear from a few interested individuals regardless of when the timeline was posted online.

General Manager Genova said that RTD has been up front with stakeholders and has stated that the agency has a process for such matters, which included the Board’s process for review.

Director Lubow asked whether the agency’s formal Board recommended action based on the PPWG recommendations would be made available to the Board prior to the public comment

General Manager Genova said the proposal would be presented to the Board in a manner similar to the service change process, wherein staff would present a draft recommended action and solicit the Directors input and seek general concurrence from the Board before presenting the draft recommended action to the public.

Director Lubow asked when this would take place.

General Manager Genova said that the final decision would be made in the third quarter of 2018 and that staff would seek input from the public in the second quarter.

Director Deadwyler asked whether concerns should be directed to General Manager Genova.

General Manager Genova said that Directors could send comments to him or to Mr. Washington and stated that they would keep a tally of everything that the Board wanted staff to think through.

Director Lubow said she was concerned about the PPWG to raise local bus fares to $3.00.

General Manager Genova said he shared her concern.

Director Lubow said that such a change would place RTD’s fares at nearly the highest in the country. She asked whether it would be helpful to put her concerns in writing.

General Manager Genova agreed and said to forward her question to both he and Mr. Washington.

Ms. McManus noted that public comments surrounding service changes are coordinated by a single person, and she asked who should coordinate comments regarding the PPWG.

General Manager Genova said that Mr. Washington would be the best person to coordinate going forward. He said that, as the discussion changes toward the fare structure, the point person could change.

First Vice-Chair Menten noted that the PPWG could come up during the public participation portion of the Board Meeting.

General Manager Genova agreed and said he also anticipated comments regarding the May service changes.

Director Lubow asked if there had been any news from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

General Manager Genova said that the administrative law judge (ALJ) would be delivering a summary to the Commissioners before they could issue a ruling.

Director Menten asked when the first meeting of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (GM Oversight) would be held in 2018.

Ms. McManus responded that the first meeting would be held in April.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether the General Manager was in the process of reviewing the goals determined at the Joint Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Strategic Planning Retreat.

General Manager Genova said he had assigned the goals to the SLT members. He mentioned he had not yet seen the summary of the retreat from the facilitators.

Ms. McManus responded that the summary would be sent out the following Wednesday.

General Manager Genova said that SLT would start working on the tactical plan, which would be discussed during the study session in April 2018.

Ms. McManus noted that the PPWG read out would also take place during the April study session and that there would be a presentation on finance during the May study session.

General Manager Genova said that staff would be working to flesh out the priorities that came out of the retreat and would then start developing the proposed task goals, which would flow through GM Oversight. He said the tactical plan was for informational purposes and served as an opportunity for staff to restate things discussed at retreat and tactically determine how to implement those things. He said that the tactical plan is not formally approved by the Board.

First Vice Chair Menten said there was a tentative plan for the Directors to start to receive the Board packet on Thursdays rather than Fridays.

Ms. McManus said that staff was working through the details and logistics of the change. She said the change was not an easy one, because getting the packet out, especially when considering the inclusion of the meeting minutes, was a challenge. She noted that the Executive Committee meetings were scheduled on Thursdays.

Director Lubow suggested that the Executive Committee could be moved to another day.

Ms. McManus reiterated that staff was looking at the logistics and the many moving parts of making the change. She said the change would be made easier once the meetings were video recorded and the closed captioning transcripts of the meetings were available. She said the only approval required would be for the vote records. She said the Board Office was at that point still responsible for producing the meeting minutes.

General Manager Genova added that, with the change to an earlier distribution date, other supporting documents would be backed up a day as well. He said logistically staff was under deadlines to deliver documents to the Board Office and that changing the date would in turn push back other things. He said that staff had advance meetings to make sure that items made it into the packet in time and that the packet itself took considerable time to compile. He noted that, in some cases, items could miss committee deadlines and would necessarily be delayed by up to a month, because the supporting documentation would need to be reviewed.

Ms. McManus noted that SLT was engaged in meetings from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. each Wednesday. She said that, if the timing of the packet were pushed forward, members of SLT would potentially not have the opportunity to approve items as they would be away from their desks.

Director Lubow asked for an update on whether news clips could be delivered in PDF format.

Ms. McManus asked whether the discussion about news clips could be pushed to the other matters portion of the agenda.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked for and update regarding the CPUC’s decision on the University of Colorado A Line.

General Manager Genova said staff anticipated the ruling would be available by the end of March or early April.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether the public could be updated about the process.

General Manager Genova said that there would be an update in his Friday report to the Board.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether anyone had concerns about the unanimous consent, and no one voiced opposition. She noted that the service changes in the recommended action on the agenda were minor.

Director Lubow said she needed to contact Broomfield about the changes.

First Vice Chair Menten asked whether she was the only no vote in committee, and Director Lubow said yes. First Vice-Chair Menten said that she and Director Mihalik voted no on the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).

Director Deadwyler said she would like to see a unanimous vote on the CBA but noted that First Vice-Chair Menten had brought up a good point regarding fiscal sustainability.

First Vice-Chair Menten said the agency was caught in tough decision, because there was a limited pool of people who want to do the jobs due to low unemployment. She said that she was concerned about operators’ salaries and stated that other jobs on the market with similar salaries required more education or an undergraduate degree. She said the agency could not go back once it began to pay operators a higher base salary and that she was concerned that union employees needed to contribute to their pension plan at a higher rate.

Director Deadwyler said she thought the salary specified in the CBA was fair, considering that operators have to deal closely with the public and are subject to safety issues. She said she was not bothered by the amount of the salary or the pension contributions and stated that the proposed salary was average for bus operators in the Denver area.

First Vice-Chair Menten said she was unsure where the transportation industry would be in two years. She asked what would happen if ridership decreased by half in that time frame.

General Manager Genova said he did not think that would happen in such a short time frame. He said that kind of reduction would happen over time and could be addressed by natural attrition and a slowing of recruitment.

Director Deadwyler said that the recommended action for the CBA cited fiscal sustainability as one of the goals accomplished by the action. She asked First Vice-Chair Menten if would find it to be helpful to remove fiscal sustainability as one of the goals achieved by the adoption of the CBA item.

First Vice-Chair Menten said it was interesting that fiscal sustainability was listed as one of the accomplished goals and asked the General Manager to respond.

General Manager Genova said that the additional cost of the renegotiated CBA was included in the 2018 budget and that, from a budgetary standpoing, was fiscally sustainable, particularly for the first year of the CBA. He said the strategic budget plan (SBP) would need to be adjusted to accommodate the second and third years of the CBA. He stated that fiscal sustainability was a major point for the negotiators. Mr. Genova said he did not know whether the salary increase went far enough and encouraged the negotiating team to consider an even higher salary considering the scope of the operator shortage, the hours of the job, the level of public interaction, and the job conditions. He said the agency researched operator salaries in Denver and reviewed other CBA’s, under which the starting hourly wage in some markets was over $30.

Ms. McManus said that the agency could not exclude the fact some bus drivers were in fact well educated.

General Manager Genova said that were many operators who look at their job as a second career and who had possibly retired for another position. He said he was pleased to see during a recent tour of RTD facilities that younger bus and rail operators had joined the organization at a time when the average age was in the 40’s.

First Vice-Chair Menten said that the working environment seemed to be the biggest problem for operators, though she noted that changes were being made.

General Manager Genova said that the agency was working to reduce split shifts. He said that having a runboard with no split shifts would mean that the agency would pay operators for a full eight hours though some may only work five. He stated that there would be economic impacts from any change and that the agency tries to balance as well as it can.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether a comparison was made between private and public pensions.

General Manager Genova said that the agency did not benchmark that data. He said the agency only looked at the Denver market when determining bus operator salaries and stated that the pension was reviewed differently because it is managed by a trust and not RTD directly. He stated that any decisions are decided by the trust.

First Vice-Chair Menten responded that RTD sets the contribution percentages, so the agency was in fact intertwined with the pension.

Director Lubow said that First Vice-Chair Menten had raised good points, especially regarding the high wages. She said that the salary issue was also a question of supply and demand.

First Vice-Chair Menten concluded the review of the agenda and said that she was not aware of any Executive Session or other business that would be discussed.

Motion:               Chair Tisdale made the motion to approve moving the March 27, 2018 Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Vote on

the Motion:               The motion passed with 3 in favor and 0 opposed. Chair Tisdale and Director Folska, Ph.D., were absent.

## III. Other Matters

First Vice-Chair Menten said she wanted to discuss GM Oversight and asked where Chair Tisdale was.

General Manager Genova said that the Chair was in Washington, D.C., for conferences for Commuting Solutions, the Denver South Economic Development Partnership, and the APTA Legislative Conference.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether other previous chairs had attended the Commuting Solutions conference, and Ms. McManus responded that they had.

General Manager Genova said that Commuting Solutions had asked every year for a Board Member to attend.

First Vice-Chair Menten noted that have Colorado’s Congressional Delegation had offices in town and asked why the Directors did not meet with them in Denver.

General Manager Genova said that they did conduct meetings in town frim time to time but stated that the trips to Washington, D.C., served as an opportunity to have one focused visit within a very short time to present a common theme.

Director Lubow said that stakeholders also attend the conferences.

First Vice-Chair Menten noted that they all flew to Washington, D.C., together.

Director Deadwyler said she was surprised that Director Menten did not attend the APTA Legislative Conference.

First Vice-Chair Menten said that her other job responsibilities made the trip an impossibility.

Director Deadwyler said she hoped that First Vice-Chair Menten would take advantage of such learning opportunities.

First Vice-Chair Menten said she wanted to talk about the General Manager’s contract. She said she had a discussion with Chair Tisdale regarding the core goals mentioned in the contract and said that she was interested in increasing the number of criteria for when the General Manager’s performance “exceeded expectations” from one to two. She said in the past she was told that the goals were written in stone and stated she did not agree with that. She said the requirement that the General Manager must fulfill certain core and task goals was stated in his contract but the goals themselves were not specified.

Ms. McManus said that the core and task goals were stated in the General Manager’s job description.

Director Lubow said that she and First Vice-Chair Menten were hoping to have the discussion with the General Manager, Director Walker, the Chair of GM Oversight, and Rolf Asphaug, RTD’s General Counsel, but the meeting did not materialize. She said the intention was not to surprise the General Manage. She said that First Vice-Chair Menten has previously sought to make changes to the goals but was told she could not. Director Lubow stated that she wanted to speak with Mr. Asphaug about the timing of when the goals could be changed.

First Vice-Chair Menten said that she was told previously that the goals should not be changed during the transition from General Manager Washington to General Manager Genova.

Ms. McManus asked who was involved in trying to put together a meeting with Mr. Asphaug and noted that the request had not come through her.

Director Lubow said that there had been a problem with communication and the meeting did not proceed appropriately.

First Vice-Chair Menten said that she would be speaking with Mr. Asphaug and that she felt her hands had been tied for several years.

General Manager Genova noted that, while Mr. Asphaug was not involved in the drafting, review, or signing of the contract, it would be appropriate for him to review and interpret it. He said that the discussion in GM Oversight was that the core goals were based on the General Manager’s job description and that considerable work had been done to put that description together. He said the goals were not tied to the contract, other than the fact that the contract stated that the General Manager should be reviewed in a manner similar to other employees. He said that revisiting the General Manager’s goals would be an appropriate conversation for GM Oversight.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether the first GM Oversight meeting was in April.

Ms. McManus stated that the committee would review reference materials and the review process, after which they would move into the process of reviewing the tactical plan and determining what 2019 would look like for that committee.

Director Lubow said it would be helpful to meet Mr. Asphaug just to be sure that the goals could be changed.

First Vice-Chair Menten said she did not feel the changes she was seeking were substantial.

Director Deadwyler encouraged them to contact Mr. Asphaug before formalizing the discussion via an agenda. \

First Vice-Chair Menten said she assumed the reason Mr. Asphaug was not involved in the contract process was that doing so would put him into an uncomfortable position.

General Manager Genova said the contract process had always been conducted by outside counsel.

Ms. McManus noted that outside counsel may need to be involved again for any contract changes.

Director Lubow said she hoped there would be no contract changes and that their intent was just to see if the core goals be changed. She said the contract was vague and there was a question of how to go about changing it.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board should perhaps retain its own attorney for a short time if Mr. Asphaug was not versed in contract review.

Director Lubow said that the discussion with Mr. Asphaug should be had first.

First Vice-Chair Menten said she just wanted to know how to tweak the review criteria.

General Manager Genova responded that Mr. Asphaug was familiar with the contract but was not a part of drafting it. He said it would be appropriate to ask Mr. Asphaug how to tweak the criteria. Regarding the core goals, he said GM Oversight has always determined that the core goals were tied to the job description, and he reiterated that the discussion was one that would appropriately take place in GM Oversight.

Director Deadwyler asked when the GM Oversight calendar would be available.

Ms. McManus said that it might be ready by March 27 but noted that she needed to review it with the Chair and Director Walker and would need to take General Manager Genova’s availability into account.

Director Deadwyler said she did not know people made such arrangements to schedule committee meetings.

Ms. McManus said that several variables, such as personal schedules, meeting dates, and the timing of surveys, needed to line up in order to make the schedule work. She said it takes months to put together the Board’s annual calendar. She noted that the GM Oversight schedule is not prepared until later on because the Chair of GM Oversight was appointed in January of each year.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked whether the Board had seen the actual CBA contract or only a summary.

General Manager Genova replied that the Board had only received a summary and that the actual contract was under final review to make sure all of the details were properly recorded.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked to receive a copy of the final contract.

General Manager Genova said he would send it to the entire Board once it was complete.

First Vice-Chair Menten asked about telephone town hall scheduling.

General Manager Genova stated that all of the Directors’ town hall dates had been set.
