JULIEN BOUQUET: All right, excellent. I'll now call the Tuesday, June 10 Special Board Meeting to order.

JOYANN RUSCHA: Director Buzek is also here, sir.
KATHLEEN CHANDLER: And so is Director Chandler.
JOYANN RUSCHA: And Chandler.
JULIEN BOUQUET: So based on my calculations, we have 13 present, 2 absent, being Gutschenritter
and Catlin. Excellent, we do have quorum. Please note that the Special Board Meeting does not have a
section for public comment this afternoon. However, the public can still offer comments by email or by
participating in person or remotely during the regularly scheduled June 24th Board meeting. Unless a
Director has something pressing of other matters to discuss, I'm going to move through this section and
on to our executive session. Are there any particular pressing matters at this time?
In a moment, the Board will meet in executive session regarding a proposed intergovernmental
agreement related to joint service for the Northwest Corridor. I'd like to amend the motion to move into
executive session to state that the Special Board Meeting will be deemed adjourned after the Board
adjourns into the executive session. For public transparency, this means that once the Board moves into
executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned. For anyone watching remotely through YouTube
or in attendance via Zoom, the regularly scheduled June Finance and Planning Committee will occur after
this meeting, with the anticipated start time of 5:30 PM. So please know that we will be back.
I'll now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following. Pursuant to 24-64024E CRS for determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing
strategy for negotiations and instructing negotiators, and 24-6-4024E CRS for legal advice regarding
proposed international intergovernmental agreement and joint service for the Northwest Corridor. Do we
have a mover?
JOYANN RUSCHA: So moved.
JULIEN BOUQUET: I have Director Ruscha as the mover.
MICHAEL GUZMAN: Second is Guzman.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Guzman is the second. I will note for the record, Director Gutschenritter has also
joined us. Is there any discussion on this matter?
OK. Well, seeing none, I got Ruscha as the mover, and I got Guzman as second. Are there any no votes
to moving into executive session? OK, seeing none. All right, for all those who are expected to attend,
would you please move to the other Zoom room? All right, we'll see you there.
JILLIAN KNAPP-RHODES: Angel, you need to close out of this meeting and go to the other one.
ANGEL PEÃ‘A: Thank you.
JILLIAN KNAPP-RHODES: No problem.
