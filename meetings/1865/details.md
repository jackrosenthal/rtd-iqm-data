#### 1. MPACT64 Update and Process - No Backup

Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that she would review the process with the Board and Maria Garcia Berry, CRL, would provide an update of the status.  She said that they met with Don Hunt, Executive Director of CDOT, and he indicated that if MPACT64 goes forward, it will be as a citizens’ initiative; there will not be a referred measure coming out of the Colorado Legislature.  Marla Lien explained that this means an independent party, or more than one, will go to the Title Board as is authorized by the Colorado Constitution and Title 1 of the Colorado Revised Statutes with a ballot title.  The Title Board would approve the title and then authorize that petitions will be circulated.  She said that to have a measure on the ballot there will need to be an adequate number of ballot signatures collected under the process outlined by state law.

Marla Lien stated that as a practical matter, this means that the RTD Board has no one to directly negotiate with about how the ballot will look; it is not a matter of going to CDOT, the Governor, State Legislature, etc. and outlining what RTD wants.  She noted that RTD has been informally asked for a list of projects by various proponents but we do not know how those will fit into the measure.  Marla Lien reiterated that this is something RTD does not have direct control over.

Marla Lien said that if a measure passes, it will not address RTD’s ability to keep any revenues under TABOR and it will not address RTD’s ability to bond.  She stated that to the extent RTD has TABOR limits on the base system, RTD may need to de-Bruce those revenues.  Also, if RTD wanted to issue debt against the revenues we would need to have a subsequent election to the extent that our debt cap has been exceeded.

Marla Lien reiterated that at this time RTD does not know how the measure will look.  She stressed that this is something the RTD Board will not have any direct control over.

Director Menten commented that the polling is being done by a private entity.  She wondered if public entities had paid for any of the polling up to this point.  Maria Garcia Berry stated that was not correct.  She said both of the polls on this issue were done by the Colorado Transportation Coalition, which is made up of the Denver Chamber, the Colorado Contractors Association, MOVE Colorado, CASTA (Colorado Association of State Transit Agencies), Colorado Concern and several other private construction/engineering firms.  Maria Garcia Berry stated that there are no public dollars, nor will they take any public dollars, in this effort.  Director Menten noted that RTD pays dues to organizations like MOVE Colorado and the Denver Chamber.  She wonders how the taxpayers have a guarantee that public funds are not being funneled to pay for these polls through these organizations.  Maria Garcia Berry said that she could not address MOVE Colorado specifically; however, organizations like the Denver Chamber segregate their funds and are very precise about what funds are used to pay for what activities.  She stated that funds going to the Colorado Transportation Coalition were coming from the Denver Chamber’s private sector fund.  Marla Lien explained that there would not be any prohibition at this point on public funds being used by an organization to do a study; the fair campaign practices act does not have any application to surveys.  She said if an entity like the Denver Chamber wanted to do a survey on various tax issues there would be no trigger of the fair campaign practices act.

Maria Garcia Berry stated that the Coalition’s decision to take no public dollars is because they do not want one public entity to control what was or was not in the poll.  She said that they have not shared the questionnaire with any public entity; the Coalition took advice, counsel and opinions but has not shared the questionnaire with any public entity.

Director Menten asked if it becomes a ballot issue once the title is set or when the signatures are certified.  Maria Garcia Berry stated that it is when the signatures are certified.

Director Lubow wondered how it was decided that this was not going to be a referendum but would be a citizens’ initiative.  Maria Garcia Berry explained that it has always been the intent of the coalition not to go to ballot by General Assembly; they have always thought it would be best if it became a grassroots effort.  Director Lubow noted that she has been involved with many citizens’ initiatives and it is an arduous process.  Maria Garcia Berry recognized that it is absolutely a huge task but it forces the organizers to talk to the voters.  Marla Lien commented that there is also no will at the Legislature to bring this forward.

Maria Garcia Berry shared that at this point the Coalition thought they would have poll results but do not as they just went into the field Sunday evening.  She noted that this was a very complex poll to put together and the Coalition has spent a great deal of time going through it.  Maria Garcia Berry informed the Board that the Coalition will have a meeting with MPACT64 at which time the Coalition will release the topline results that they think are germane.  She said the single most important thing that they are trying to find out is what the tax appetite is in the State of Colorado.  Maria Garcia Berry commented that given the devastation that Amendment 66 went through there is no appetite in the private sector for a tax campaign; this means that the Coalition needs to understand how important transportation is to the voters of the State of Colorado.  Maria Garcia Berry reiterated that the Coalition would give some preliminary topline results to MPACT64 that could also be presented to the RTD Board at a later date.  She stressed that this is a private poll so the Coalition will not release the entire poll; they will just release the critical information.  She stated that if the private sector indicates they do not have an appetite for this tax there will not be an initiative in Colorado.

Director Folska asked what the process would look like if there was a referendum from the Legislature.  Marla Lien stated that if the Legislature refers something to ballot there is no need for the petition process, campaign, etc. as the item is on the ballot.  She explained that this means that someone in one of the chambers has to bring a bill with the ballot language that is agreed upon by both chambers and then passed.  Marla Lien noted that it is a pretty daunting process either way.  Director Folska also wondered if any of RTD’s lobbyists or our Government Liaison Office had approached anyone in the Transportation Committee of the State Legislature about this measure.  Marla Lien said that RTD has not suggested that we would be the proponent of a State transportation tax.

Maria Garcia Berry stated that is it also important for the Board to keep in mind that the Legislature would have to determine if this was an amendment to the Colorado Constitution or if this was a referred law.  She does not believe RTD could get a 2/3 vote to go to ballot and amend the Constitution.  Maria Garcia Berry commented that Amendment 66 is a perfect example of how this can get very confusing to voters.  Director Folska stated that the issues between education and transportation are very different so she is cautious of compare the two; 80% of the population in Colorado does not have children in school but everyone has to use the roads.  Maria Garcia Berry agreed that you cannot look at the education issue and say that you cannot pass a tax in Colorado.  She said that the biggest issue is determining how important transportation is to the people of Colorado.  She stated that if it is not a priority the tax will not pass.

Director Lubow asked when the Coalition thought they might go to MPACT64 with their top line.  She thinks it would be great if the presentation could be given to the RTD Board after that.  Maria Garcia Berry stated that assuming the polling was completed that evening they will be presenting to MPACT64 on Friday, January 10, 2013.

Committee Chair James thanked Marla Lien and Maria Garcia Berry for their presentation.
