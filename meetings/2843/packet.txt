RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Planning
expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive
Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The Board previously approved all funding for this contract last fall when they
adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the $1,420,000 DRCOG
Regional Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December 2018. The funds are being
temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the
2019 Amended Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant funds received and local funds,
which were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Finance and
Administration expense budget for development of an updated operating and maintenance cost
model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort. The funds are being temporarily taken out of
the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget
with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.
This action addresses four of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
 Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION
Preparation of a systems optimization plan/ comprehensive operations analysis is one important
element of the Board adopted 2019 Task Goal #4 (Address future Transportation Needs and
Methods.) The Board directed effort will be an integral component of RTD’s Transportation
Transformation initiative, as the District evolves as both a mobility integrator and public transit
provider. The Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan) is anticipated to
provide guidance on future RTD services, to complement FasTracks, and to chart a course that
optimizes existing and future FasTracks infrastructure and determines what other future investments
are needed. The plan is intended to provide a vision for RTD’s existing rail system, focus on
ancillary services such as multi-modal first/last mile connections, maximize FasTracks investments,
address staffing-related challenges, evaluate long-term parking needs, determine the locations nature
of future bus maintenance facility(s), consider fleet electrification and review RTD’s boundaries. The
effort also will include a re-examination of RTD’s financial planning processes to determine how RTD
can improve them to best meet the changing service and infrastructure needs of the District in a

fiscally sustainable manner. The T2 Comp Plan, was funded over two years in the 2019 -2024 MidTerm Financial Plan that was adopted by the Board this past fall. The 2019 Adopted Budget
included $1,260,000 for consultant services, with an additional $1,837,000 in inflated dollars
programmed in 2020 in the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
After the adoption of the 2019 Adopted Budget, RTD received an additional $1,420,000 for the T2
Comp Plan through a federal grant competitively awarded by DRCOG, bringing the total available
funding for the project to $4,517,000. The grant funds will be available to RTD in October 2019.
Staff is looking to begin a procurement process for consultant services to complete the T2 Comp
Plan. This process would lead to selection of a consultant in April 2019, with the Board of Directors
approving the resulting contract at the May 2019 Board meeting.
Staff expects the effort to span approximately two years, and these funds were programmed in the
2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan in 2019 and 2020 to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order t o issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because RTD would not be able to stop work at the end of 2019 if the Board were
to decide not to appropriate the 2020 funds in the 2020 budget. The budget transfer for the T2
Comp Plan will allow the Board to award the contract in May 2019, with all activities associated
with the plan completed by the middle of 2021. Thus, RTD will be able to implement all of the near term elements of the plan, along with the revised financial planning process, in time for adoption of
the 2022 budget. Total funding for the T2 Comp Plan is $4,517,000, consisting of $1,420,000 of
grant funds and $3,097,000 of RTD local funds.
A significant element of the fiscal sustainability evaluation is determining the costs of potential
future service and mobility elements, and comparing those costs to the future cost of providing
service under RTD’s current service level. During the preparation of the scope of work for the T2
Comp Plan, staff determined that the current operating and maintenance cost forecasting tools
would need to be refined and enhanced in order to accomplish this objective. Staff also determined
that it would be better to issue a separate contract to develop these forecasting tools, rather than
including it in the overall T2 Comp Plan project scope. This will allow RTD to engage a firm with
specific expertise in operating and maintenance cost forecasting, and provide RTD with tools that
can be used for other planning and budgeting efforts beyond the scope and time horizon of th e T2
Comp Plan effort. The O&M cost model would be funded with $200,000 of RTD local funds from
the overall $4,517,000 T2 project budget mentioned in the paragraph above.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. The local funds were approved in the 2019-2024 MidTerm Financial Plan to be expended in 2020. RTD will receive additional grant funds through
DRCOG to cover any costs not originally included in the Mid-Term Financial Plan. These revenues
will be included in the 2019 Amended Budget and will be used to replenish the Operating Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Plan ning
expense budget to fully fund a contract award for the Transportation Transformation
Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The Board previously approved all funding for this contract
last fall when they adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial Plan, with the exception of the
$1,420,000 DRCOG Regional Share TIP funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December

2018. The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue
and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with a combination of the DRCOG grant
funds received and local funds, which were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors approve a budget transfer of $200,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Finance
and Administration expense budget for development of an updated operating and maintenance
cost model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort. The funds are being temporarily taken
out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended
Budget with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the Board last fall.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at this
time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2019 Amended Budget. This action is not
recommended since it will delay the procurement process, contract award, and Notice to Proceed
by at least four months. Given the 24-month projected schedule for completion of the plan and
the need to coordinate short-term implementation with the annual budget cycle, this means that
RTD would not see all the elements of the plan implemented until 2023.

Date:
Subject:

Date: February 7, 2019

Board Meeting Date: February 26, 2019
Amended Board Operating Guidelines

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors that the Board approve a motion to adopt the
attached Resolution No. ______, Series of 2019, along with the associated revised Board Operating
Guidelines governing specific aspects of the conduct of business by the Board and its members.
Specifically the guidelines address governance policy-setting, meeting efficiency, communication,
collaboration, and cooperation.
Furthermore, the Chair recommends that the Board renew annually, at the first meeting of the Board
each year, its commitment to uphold the principles memorialized in the revised Board Operating
Guidelines and to amend the guidelines periodically as necessary to reflect current best practices.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
In 2014, the Board adopted a resolution indicating its desire to operate in a considerate, thorough, and
effective manner, to respect the ideas and opinions of all Board members, and to be open and
transparent in the conduct of its business. Accompanying that resolution was a series of amended Board
Operating Guidelines, initially adopted following a Board retreat in 2008, which outlined certain
commitments and values of the Board and identified specific steps to enhance the Board’s effectiveness
moving forward.
DISCUSSION
The revised Board Operating Guidelines incorporate the 2014 guidelines as amended, as well as ground
rules adopted by the Board to govern the conduct of business during the retreats held in 2018. Also
incorporated by reference within the guidelines are a November 14, 2018 memorandum from RTD
General Counsel Rolf Asphaug identifying uncodified but long-established customs and practices
attendant to the official meetings of the Board and an August 22, 2018 memorandum from RTD General
Counsel Rolf Asphaug addressing confidentiality.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the attached resolution and revised Board Operating Guidelines.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

2. To reject the resolution and revised Board Operating Guidelines, in which case Resolution 004,
Series of 2014, and the associated operating guidelines adopted in the same year would remain in
full force and effect.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of either the resolution or the revised operating
guidelines.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES

Our Board is committed to transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value
when it focuses on and helps clarify high-level policy issues and plans, including the policies
that underpin capital and operating budgets. In setting high-level policies and plans, the
Board must understand the vision and mission of RTD and its priority objectives for coming
years as well as the long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position
RTD to be able to respond flexibly, responsibly, and transparently to unique factors as they
present, including the current organizational shift in focus from capital development to
operations and maintenance, challenges in optimizing service levels in order to meet
customer demands, and the introduction of disruptive transit technologies, in order better to
serve our constituents in new and varying ways. We appreciate that, as elected officials,
we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility to
each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also

balance between open and thorough discussions and timely decisions to bring
discussions to closure and to remind Board members of our commitment to these
guidelines.
SPECIFIC NEXT STEPS
▪

Devote time for a Board discussion of criteria to be used in RTD RFPs, which should
include the appropriate level of due diligence the Board should perform on contracts.

▪

Define a date for a Board retreat designed to elicit and discuss some of the most
important policy concerns of Board members.

▪

Establish an annual Joint Board/Staff meeting or retreat that will focus exclusively on
policy guidance for the formulation of the operating and capital budget and the General
Manager’s Tactical Goals (i.e. strategic planning advance).

▪

Identify the types of issues that do not need to come before the Board (e.g., items
previously approved in the budget process or items that could be addressed solely by
staff).

▪

Have staff support the Board through its packet preparation with specific actions such
as:
▪ highlighting both the guiding policy issue and the decision being sought, and the
strategic goal that the action supports.
▪ limiting the volume of material (augmented by appended material if needed),
▪ bringing more complex items to the Board initially as discussion items and later
as decision items,
▪ providing packets sufficiently ahead of time so that when necessary Board
members can be in contact with either staff or constituents, and,
▪ when appropriate, setting forth options for Board consideration.

▪

Adopt flexible ground rules to guide Board discussions such as:
▪ avoid repeating arguments,
▪ focus on new points,
▪ avoid distracting non-verbal communications, and,
▪ limit comments when a decision of the Board is overwhelmingly clear.



Re-commit to these modified guidelines in 2014 and to ensure we are holding
ourselves accountable to the intent of these guidelines. Also make an accompanying
commitment to review their application on an as-needed basis from the date of this
adoption.

Re:

RTD Board of Directors Customs Relating to Board Meetings

This memorandum (1) discusses Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs
relating to RTD Board Meetings; and (2) sets forth RTD staff’s understanding of the
current Customs relating to RTD Board meetings. (There are no current Special Rules of
Order or Standing Rules adopted by the RTD Board.) Normal rules of order in the Bylaws
can be suspended or supplemented by special rules only by a two-thirds vote, and some
rules cannot be suspended.1 By contrast, standing rules and customs can be revised
going forward, or modified for any particular matter, by majority vote of the Board.2
This memo begins by explaining the purpose and authority for Special Rules of Order,
Standing Rules, and Customs. The meme then discusses the differences between Special
Rules of Order as opposed to Standing Rules and Customs. The memo then sets forth
RTD Board Meeting Customs as currently understood by RTD staff. These Customs
include such matters as:


Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and questions

A. Introduction: Definitions, purposes, and authority for Special Rules of
Order, Standing Rules, and Customs

Attachment: 2018-11-14 DRAFT Memo re Board Customs (3753 : Amended Board Operating Guidelines)

Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs do not replace the RTD Bylaws
themselves, any provisions set forth in Robert’s Rules of Order, or any statutory
requirements such as laws governing executive sessions. Instead, RTD’s Board Bylaws
state:
“The current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, newly revised, shall govern
parliamentary procedure for the Board and its Committees except as herein provided
or as otherwise provided by law.”3
Robert’s Rules recognizes that neither it nor an organization’s bylaws can address all
procedures that are used for meetings. Robert’s Rules therefore recognizes the roles of
“special rules of order,” “standing rules” and “customs” in filling gaps not covered by an
organization’s bylaws or Robert’s Rules.4 (Robert’s 11th ed., pp. 18-19).
1. Special Rules of Order
Robert’s Rules explains Special Rules of Order as follows:
“The term rules of order refers to written rules of parliamentary procedure formally
adopted by … an organization. … The usual and preferable method … is … to place
in its bylaws a provision prescribing that the current edition of a specified and
generally accepted manual of parliamentary law shall be the organization’s
parliamentary authority, and then to adopt only such special rules of order as it finds
needed to supplement or modify rules contained in that manual.”5
Robert’s Rules notes that when, as with RTD, a source such as Robert’s Rules is
identified as the parliamentary authority “except as herein provided or as otherwise
provided by law,” a special rule of order cannot supersede anything within Robert’s
Rules except by a two-thirds vote.6 Certain rules of order can never be superseded –
such as fundamental principles of parliamentary law7 – but others can be suspended for
a particular matter by a two-thirds vote.
Unanimous consent is a good way to save time by suspending the rules, effectively
creating a one-time special rule. For example, a member may “ask unanimous consent
to suspend the rules” to adopt some non-controversial resolutions before proceeding to
3

RTD Bylaws, Art. XIII (11/29/2016).
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, pp. 15-19.
5
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 15.
6
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 17; and Sec. 25, pp. 260-267.
7
Examples of such fundamental principles includes the rule that allows only one question to be
considered at a time (note, however, that this rule does allow unanimous consent agendas); and
rules giving the right to vote to a nonmember or an absentee member. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25,
p. 263. The basic rights of individual members can also not be suspended except through
disciplinary action. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25, p. 264.

2. Standing Rules
Robert’s Rules explains Standing Rules as follows:
“Standing rules … are rules (1) which are related to the details of the administration
of a society rather than to parliamentary procedure, and (2) which can be adopted
or changed upon the same conditions as any ordinary act of the society. An example
of such a rule might be one setting the hour at which meetings are to begin, or one
relating to the maintenance of a guest register. Standing rules generally are …
adopted … individually if and when the need arises. A standing rule can be adopted
by a majority vote … provided that it does not conflict with or amend any existing
rule or act of the society.”9
RTD currently has no Board-adopted Standing Rules: i.e., rules relating to details of
administration of its meetings rather than to parliamentary procedure, adopted by the
Board through motion and majority vote. Instead, RTD’s Bylaws are detailed in
prescribing certain administrative requirements.
3. Customs
Robert’s Rules describes Customs as follows:
“In some organizations, a particular practice may sometimes come to be followed as
a matter of established custom so that it is treated practically as if it were prescribed
by a rule. If there is no contrary provision in the parliamentary authority or written
rules of the organization, the established custom should be adhered to unless the
assembly, by a majority vote, agrees in a particular instance to do otherwise.
However, if a customary practice is or becomes in conflict with the parliamentary
authority or any written rule, and a Point of Order citing the conflict is raised at any
time, the custom falls to the ground, and the conflicting provision in the
parliamentary authority or written rule must thereafter be complied with. If it is then
desired to follow the former practice, a special rule of order (or, in appropriate
circumstances, a standing rule or a bylaw provision) can be added or amended to
incorporate it.”10
The rest of this memo summarizes RTD’s Board meeting Customs as understood by RTD
staff.

members to vote intelligibly on his undebatable motion.”8 If anyone objects, a formal
motion to suspend the rules is taken up.

1.B.2.d

The following are established Customs at RTD Board meetings, as currently identified by
RTD staff. (RTD staff currently knows of no Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.)
There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board formally adopts any Special Rules of Order or
Standing Rules.
1. Voting through RTD’s software system
RTD uses a special software system to display the agenda, the current location in the
agenda, Director requests to speak, and Director votes.
a. Unless the Chair of a meeting determines that the software
has malfunctioned, a Director’s vote may not be changed
after votes flash on the screen except by unanimous consent.
RTD employs an electronic voting system intended to ensure that all Board members
vote at the same time, instead of some members basing their votes upon how others
have voted. Once everyone has registered their votes on their computer terminals, the
final tally flashes up on the screen.
RTD’s custom is that the flashing up of the results on the screen constitutes the official
“announcement,” after which a vote may be changed only through unanimous consent.
This Custom is consistent with a primary purpose of the voting software: to prevent
vote-changing and to make the simultaneous “reveal” of all votes on the screen the
official “announcement.” This Custom is also consistent with Robert’s Rules, which
provide that a member may change her or his vote at any time up to when the result is
“announced.” After that, a change may be done only by unanimous consent.
For this reason, it is very important to make sure Board members understand the effect
of a “yes” or “no” vote, especially in votes on amendments or procedural matters.
b. For Committee meetings, Directors attending by phone
should state their vote before the electronic vote is
conducted. Their vote is then added to the result on the
screen, and the Chair states the final vote and result.
c. If the software system is inoperable, for matters involving a
recommended action or another act of a general or
permanent nature, Directors must vote by a roll call vote as
required by the RTD Bylaws.11
RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(a), p. 13. The Bylaws authorize “a roll call or electronically recorded
vote by the Executive Director to the Board …” Shows of hands, voice votes, etc. are only
permitted for other action. RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(e), p. 14.

B. Customs at RTD Board Meetings

1.B.2.d

5

a. The Chair should recognize Director requests to speak, or to
ask questions of staff, in the order of speaker requests set
forth in the software system.
b. The Chair may allow reasonable, brief follow-up questions.
c. Once all Directors on the screen have been given the
opportunity to speak at least once, the Chair should ask each
Director attending by phone whether they wish to speak.
d. After all Directors have spoken, the Chair may speak
concerning a matter.
3. Participation of RTD staff in Board and Committee discussions
a. After a staff Recommended Action item is moved and
seconded, RTD staff are customarily asked by the Chair to
provide an introductory explanation of the item without the
need for questions and answers.
b. Subsequent questions by Directors are handled as Director
requests to speak. RTD Board meetings generally allow direct
questions to staff or other Directors, and responses, without
the need to go through the Chair, but the Chair retains
discretion to handle the conduct of comments and questions.
4. Accessibility, including accessible visual aids and recordings
a. Visual aids and recordings at Board meetings should be made
accessible to participants with visual or hearing impairments.
b. Speakers should generally identify themselves by name and
title before beginning to speak.
5. Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
a. Directors may not participate by phone in executive
sessions.12
12

At some recent meetings, Directors were allowed to participate by phone in executive sessions.
Upon further review, it appears that Directors have not historically participated by phone in
executive sessions. Participation by phone is problematic in that other attendees cannot verify
that attendance is limited to permitted participants. As with any other custom, the Board could
vote to allow phone participation on a case by case basis. In such case, staff recommends that

6. Location and authorization of public videotaping equipment

Attachment: 2018-11-14 DRAFT Memo re Board Customs (3753 : Amended Board Operating Guidelines)

a. Public videotaping equipment is only permitted at such
locations as authorized by RTD Transit Police and must not
disrupt the meeting.
7. Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and
questions
a. Public comments are limited to three minutes in length.
b. Questions from the public will not be answered at the
meeting but will be noted for future response.
c. Public officials are allowed to speak first.
8. Recognition of retiring employees
a. Retiring employees are recognized at the start of RTD Board
Meetings.
b. Retirees who are present are generally honored with a
statement by their AGM and/or manager and are invited to
give a brief statement.
9. What is “old” and “new” business
a. “Old business” is limited to the narrow category of nonrecommended action items that have been postponed to a
time certain at a previous Board or Committee meeting.13
b. “New business” is generally limited to Directors’ personal
announcements.14
10. Adding items to the Agenda by request of at least three Board
members
a. Items may be added directly to a regular Board meeting
Agenda by at least three Board members without having to
any Director participating by phone must first state on the record that the Director is listening by
handset or headset (not speakerphone), and that no other persons are present.
13
RTD’s Bylaws specify that recommended action items that are held over or tabled from a
previous meeting are to be taken up under “Recommended Action,” before new items from
committees. See RTD Bylaws Art. V, Sec. 3(c), p. 11.
14
Items added to the Agenda by three Board members are taken up under “Recommended
Action.” See RTD Bylaws Art. V, Section 3(c), p. 11.

Packet Pg. 27

1.B.2.d

first go through a Standing Committee or Executive
Committee; however, unless the item is of an emergency
nature, to encourage careful debate and consideration the
Chair may refer such an item to a Standing Committee and
the Executive Committee for approval prior to the item being
placed on the Board Meeting Agenda. Approval of such an
item by a Standing Committee converts the item to an “item
from committee.”15
11. Placement of executive sessions when there are multiple
Committee meetings
a. Where two Committee meetings are scheduled for the same
meeting, to avoid the need for members of the public and
non-essential staff to leave prior to completion of all other
business, the Committee Chairs may coordinate to arrange
for any executive session(s) to take place at the conclusion of
the joint meeting.
b. The above procedure is subject to any Director making a
Point of Order to require the executive session to take place
in the standard order of business.
12. Safety Moment
a. Each Board and Committee meeting will begin with a Safety
Moment.
13. Pledge of Allegiance
a. Board Meetings (not Committee Meetings) will begin with the
Pledge of Allegiance.
14. Chair’s participation in matters under debate
a. When taking part in the debate on matters before committee
and Board meetings, the Chair of the Board typically does so
sparingly and at the end of the discussion period.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Date: February 7, 2019

Requested
by:

Doug Tisdale, Board Chair

Date:
Subject:

Board Meeting Date: January 29, 2019
Revised Committee Charters

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors that the Board approve a motion to adopt the
attached revised charters of the Board’s standing committees.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical
Leadership.
BACKGROUND
The principal roles each of the Board’s standing committees are briefly described in the Board Bylaws.
The Board further defines the scope, composition, responsibilities, and requirements of each committee
by way of a committee charter. Each of the Board’s standing committees was created as the Board
deemed necessary to guide the business needs of the agency. As such the charters were created over a
span of years, and certain provisions contained in one committee’s charter may be absent or different
from another.
DISCUSSION
The proposed revisions attempt to harmonize the provisions of the Board’s committee charters for
purposes of reasonable uniformity and consistency across all charters. Additionally the name of the
“Government Relations Committee” has been changed to “Communications & Government Relations
Committee” by request of the Board in order to provide an avenue for periodic reporting to the Board
from the Communications Department.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the revisions to the Board’s standing committee charters to bring their provisions in line
with one another.
2. To reject the revisions to the currently adopted charters.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the revised committee charters.

Board Meeting Date: January 29, 2019
Approval of a Minor Change to the Board
Bylaws Regarding the Name of the Government
Relations Committee

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,

Update on Commercial Banking Contract

CFO/AGM,

Finance

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD maintains accounts with multiple banks for various business needs. Currently, RTD has various
types of accounts including commercial checking accounts (Wells Fargo), merchant banking (Wells
Fargo), custody accounts where investments are held (UMB Bank), trustee accounts related to RTD
capital financing (UMB Bank, Bank of New York and US Bank), escrow accounts (Zions Bank) and
Capital Leases (JP Morgan Chase Bank). RTD has 13 additional banks (and one broker-dealer) in its
investment bank pool, which provide services related to capital financing.
The scope of our commercial banking contract includes the following services:









The operation and servicing of six distinct bank accounts
o Vendor payments
o Accounts Receivable
o Payroll processing
Controlled disbursement services
Automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfer services
Cash vault services
Electronic stop-payment services
Lockbox processing
Discounted Employee banking services

The cost of these services is approximately $100,000 per year prior to earnings deductions.
Wells Fargo has been RTD’s commercial bank since 2004. The original contract was awarded in June
2004 pursuant to competitive procurement practices. The initial contract term was for five years with
three years of options. In 2012, Wells Fargo won a competitive procurement process through the State
of Colorado and offered the same favorable terms to RTD. At the time, it was determined to be in the
best interest of RTD to award its commercial banking contract to Wells Fargo to continue reliable service
and for cost savings.
The current RTD/Wells Fargo Contract is expiring and RTD will need to decide whether to proceed with
its own competitive procurement or participate in the State’s new contract terms with Wells Fargo.
Due to the dollar amount of the contract, this is an item that would be under the General Manager’s
authority.
DISCUSSION
The State of Colorado finalized a Request for Proposals (RFP) for commercial banking services in January
2019. The State allows for local governments to piggyback on the contract terms. RTD participated in

Packet Pg. 144

1.C.3

a similar structure for the 2012 contract. The benefit of participating in the Sate process is that they
are a much larger organization with higher transaction volume than RTD and will likely be able to obtain
lower pricing than RTD can obtain on its own.
If RTD decides to not piggyback on the State RFP, the path forward would include beginning the RTD
competitive procurement process which will likely take a minimum of six months. It is possible that
pricing obtained through this process could be less attractive than what may be available in the State’s
new contract.
The state issued RFP#TL-18-002 in 2018. The evaluation factors were:








Technical Approach
Service Quality
Information Reporting
Financial Strength and Stability
Qualifications and Experience
Community Presence
Pricing

Four banks proposed:





JPMorgan Chase
Key Bank
U.S. Bank
Wells Fargo

The selection panel unanimously selected Wells Fargo.
The new fee structure of the State’s contract would save RTD approximately $6,000 (~5% reduction)
per year. Also, the new earnings credit rate that Wells Fargo pays on RTD’s commercial checking
deposits has also improved by approximately 150% and would equate to an annual benefit of
approximately $75,000 annually compared to the current contract earnings credit rate. For example: if
our annual fee was approximately $100,000 then it would be reduced by $75,000 for a net annual cost
of $25,000.
Were the District to change commercial banks through an RTD RFP process, an extended period of
system modifications and implementation would be required along with the maintenance of parallel
processes for some period of time prior to a “go live” with a substitute financial institution. This
implementation and transition would likely necessitate an increase in staff and/or consultant hours and
substantial costs that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.
Over the term of these contracts, the District has modified its processes and information technology
systems in order to keep pace with the advancement of technology, a general increase in electronic
forms of commerce and significant advancements in the processing of financial transactions. Integration
between RTD’s systems and those of its commercial bank are crucial to the efficient processing of
vendor payments, the management of accounts receivable, payroll processing and funds transfer. RTD’s
integration with its banking institution is well-developed, tested and trusted.

1.C.3

The District has received outstanding service from Wells Fargo through the term of the commercial
banking contracts. Further, Wells Fargo has been proactive in suggesting account modifications aimed at
protecting the District against fraud, streamlining its banking processes, and further reducing its bankingrelated costs.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2018 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the fourth
quarter of 2018. The U.S. unemployment rate remained low and general inflationary pressures remained
tame.
In view of inflation and labor market conditions, Federal Reserve Open Market Committee raised the
target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent in December. In January, the Committee
stated that it “will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range may be
appropriate”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of December was 2.24%. Investment
income for the year of 2018 was $7.1 million.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Subject:

Fare Implementation Update

Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares
and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements. RTD staff presented a
recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September 2018. The goal of
this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, and changes and additions to the
Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled and we are now focusing on the low income
fare program development.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the low income program using the State’s public benefits application
system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and OIT every
week for several months.
The following has been completed:


OIT has provided an initial range of pricing for the development, storage and processing of the
low income program enrollment within their PEAK system, and these initial amounts are within
RTD’s budget.



The first meeting of the Market Advisory Group with low income program stakeholders has been
held. There are three meetings planned in total. This group will provide recommendations to RTD
for branding, marketing and outreach for the low income fare program. The recommendations are
anticipated to be made in late March or early April.

Next Steps




Finalize the Scope of Work (SOW) and business requirements for OIT to develop the application
and enrollment for the program in the State’s PEAK system.
Finalize the IGA between the state and RTD for development, processing, and data storage.
Finalize the technical design document with OIT for the low income program software
development in PEAK.
