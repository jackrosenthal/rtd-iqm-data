B. Recommended Actions

• Budget Actions for T2 and O and M Cost Model
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $3,057,000
from the Operating Reserve to the Planning expense budget to fully fund
a contract award for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive
Plan (T2 Comp Plan). The Board previously approved all funding for this
contract last fall when they adopted the 2019-2024 Mid-Term Financial
Plan, with the exception of the $1,420,000 DRCOG Regional Share TIP
funding approved by the DRCOG Board in December 2018. The funds are
being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due to a timing
issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget with a
combination of the DRCOG grant funds received and local funds, which
were programmed to be expended in 2020.
It is further recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of
$200,000 from the Operating Reserve to the Finance and Administration
expense budget for development of an updated operating and
maintenance cost model to support the T2 Comprehensive Plan effort.
The funds are being temporarily taken out of the Operating Reserve due
to a timing issue and will be replenished in the 2019 Amended Budget
with local funds for the T2 Comp Plan that had been approved by the
Board last fall.
