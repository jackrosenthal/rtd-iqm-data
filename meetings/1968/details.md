#### 1. Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy

It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the implementation of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the October 28, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, explained that in compliance with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) policy, RTD solicited public feedback on the policy during the Fare Study Problem Identification phase.  He noted that the policy is an FTA basic requirement.

Director Lubow said that nothing seems to be looking at how people of lower income would be impacted by a fare increase under FTA requirements.  She posed an example of a $1 fare increase and how this would infinitely affect lower income people more than higher income people.  She asked when and how under the federal analysis does RTD as an agency starts caring about this matter.  Michael Washington replied that FTA requirements do care very much about this matter.  Any proposed fare increase would be examined against the percentage of low income people using that fare media.  If low income usage is at a 5% rate or higher, it would be considered a disproportionate impact and the fare change proposal needs to be revised.

Director Lubow supposed as an example a dollar increase proposal.  This is found to have disproportionate impact.  She asked if that would mean local fares may change but regional fares would not.  Michael Washington said that this is true.  He noted that there are different degrees at which minorities and low income people use different fare rates.  To do a $1 increase across the board would still create disproportionate impact.  This type of increase would not be advisable.  Director Lubow asked if the federal analysis would then not look at the dollar figure.  Michael Washington affirmed that federal analysis would not look at the dollar figure.  Federal analysis would look at the community impacted by the percentage.  He said that equity as defined by Title VI looks at the proportion of the minority population that is impacted.  If they are not impacted by fare change technically it is not a violation of the law.  Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede requested that Director Lubow take any further questions for staff offline.

Director Solano stated that this issue is a complex dilemma.  He noted that it needs to be weighed against revenue and efficiency/inefficiency.  He said he looks at the need because he serves a number of low income people in his District.  He said that there is a balance that needs to be addressed.

Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede called on Director Lubow and asked her to keep her comments brief.  Director Lubow agreed with Director Solano’s point.  She said that this issue goes beyond Title VI requirements into what RTD thinks is fair.

Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. ADA Update

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, reviewed the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) update included in the Civil Rights Committee meeting packet for October 21, 2014.  He reminded the Directors that the last ADA update was presented during the February 11, 2014 Civil Rights Committee meeting.  The update included the creation of 3 new positions as well as communications, compliance, and training.

When discussing the new positions, Kenn Hardin pointed out that the ADA Coordinator would work in the Civil Rights Division.  The ADA Liaison Officers would each work in the Bus Operations Division and the Fixed Bus Route/Paratransit Contracted Services Division.

Kenn Hardin noted that Chair Sisk and Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede suggested creating a brochure to promote the ADA services offered.  Kenn Hardin asked the Directors familiar with the ADA program to provide quotes for the brochure.  Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede asked the Directors to provide the quotes to Paula Perdue, Executive Director of the Board Office.

Director Folska said that she applauds the integration of ADA policy into all the Divisions.  She noted that civil rights are for all humans.  With regard to employment issues, she recommended the following resources:

- Kathleen Martinez, Assistant Secretary of the Office of Disability Employment Policy at the U.S. Department of Labor, who is blind

- Rebecca Cokley, Executive Director of the National Council of Disabilities

- Geoffrey Ames, Accessibility Implementation Consultant at Meeting the Challenge, Inc.

Director Menten asked if any of the positions were required by the FTA regulations.  She also inquired regarding the full time or part time status and salary of the positions.  Kenn Hardin said that the 3 positions are not required by the Federal government.  He said that all three positions would be full time.  The ADA Coordinator position is the only position that has been defined.  Kenn Hardin said he would get the salary figure of that position to the Directors.  He noted that the other two positions are still in development and do not have a salary figure attached.

Director Menten pointed out the West line stations and Denver Union Station misses in design regarding ADA.  She asked if one of the positions would be looking at assisting in future designs.  Kenn Hardin replied that the ADA Coordinator will be involved with all the Divisions, including Planning.

Director Tobiassen expressed his thanks to the staff.  He said that RTD provides a superb transit system that involves civil rights and ADA.  He cited a recent experience helping his brother-in-law navigate the Colorado Springs transit system, which he said was very challenging.  He said RTD allows people with disabilities to be independent.  Kenn Hardin stated that it begins with the work of many of the Divisions.  He said that it start with the leadership and actions of the Board, the General Manager, and the Senior Leadership Team.  He expressed his thanks to Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, and his team for always being willing to work and coordinate.  Kenn Hardin said that it takes a while to build a program of this nature.  He asked the Directors for patience and understanding as the Agency goes through this growth process.

Director Anderson agreed with Director Menten on the many ADA misses along the West line, specifically at the Federal Center Station.  Director Anderson said that the benches are too far away from the train.  She suggested staff would visit the Federal Center station with a person who needs a cane for mobility to see what improvements could be made.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she was very pleased to see the ADA projects moving forward.  She commended Kenn Hardin, his team, and the Agency for their work.  She agreed with her Director colleagues in that RTD is a needed entity to provide independence.

##### a. Board Report Update 10-21-2014

### D. Other Matters

Director Deadwyler addressed the article published in the Denver Post earlier in the week regarding diversity at Denver Union Station (DUS).  She said that the reply by Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, was great explaining the inaccuracies with the lease and renovation approvals, among other details.  Director Deadwyler, however, felt that the reply missed the point the article was trying to make about diversity at DUS.  She said that the Board directed staff when making the contract with USA to keep DUS available for the average Joe.  She wondered if RTD should have been overseeing the contract to make sure it carried out the Board wishes.  Scott Reed stated that his email to the author noted the lack of accuracy in his statements on what RTD had control over and the changes that could have been made given the historical designation of the property.  He said that it was not his place to comment on any suppositions and observations.

Director Deadwyler said that this article raises the diversity issue.  She said that several of her constituents have mentioned that they do not go to DUS because they feel it is not for them.  She reiterated her question regarding who was responsible on the RTD side to ensure that the things the Board had in mind were addressed.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, replied that construction employed WIN program participants.  She stated that RTD specified that the main level needed to be open to the public with seating available at all times and no hotel functions.  RTD set the times when the building opened and closed.  RTD did not discuss price settings, leasing, nor the ownership structure.  It was always known that the hotel would be a 4 to 5 star hotel.  Marla Lien reaffirmed that everything approved by the Board had been implemented.  Director Deadwyler remembered Dana Crawford sitting on the front row of Board meetings assuring the Directors that it would be a participation-by-all place.  She said that both Dana Crawford and USA made promises that were not kept.  She said that RTD missed the boat in including participation of all cultures.  She pointed out that if people do not feel comfortable it is not the people’s house.  Director Deadwyler said that if this continues we would see people being thrown out of the building because they do not fit in.

Director Folska said that this was an opportunity for RTD to differentiate its brand form the Crawford hotel as the operator has a 99 year lease.  Scott Reed stated that was the point he made when he first talked to the reporter.  He pointed out that RTD has no control over the points he addressed.

Director Walker agreed that it is not in RTD’s or Scott Reed’s place to comment on what others think.  He believes Scott Reed’s reply was great and to the extent of his job.

Director Solano mentioned that hindsight is 20/20.  He noted that past Boards were not diverse and their decisions have been implemented.  It is up to the current Board to move forward.  He stated that he advocates for more people of color to take office.  He referred to an article on the Westword which stated that people move to Denver for the diversity.  People enjoy the places along Federal Boulevard due to its diversity.  He agreed with Director Deadwyler in that DUS is out of range for many, including himself.  He suggested getting minorities on the Board and others that look after minorities.

Director Lubow said that the Directors need to look at the bigger picture.  If indeed it is true that this big project turned out to have an air of exclusivity, the Directors need to ask what can be done so that this does not happen again, avoiding the finger pointing.  She stated she feels the same way about handicap access.

Chair Sisk said it is unfair for the current Board to criticize past Board and staff members.  He agreed with Director Lubow that this may be an opportunity for the Board and staff to be more inclusive; the Board and staff can always do a better job.  He pointed out that DUS is a project we can all be proud of.  He said that as members of the Board we are to be proud of all the components of the District: DUS, Denver International Airport, Federal, etc.  He said that criticizing is not useful.

Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede took a point of privilege since DUS is in her District.  She said that she was on the Board that voted for all the DUS elements.  She stated that as a Latina she took to heart and a very public stand that this was the living room of the community.  She said that she had never worked with such a caring, diverse, and willing group of people.  She is very proud to have served with those who worked for the betterment of the whole community.  Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede said that diversity was approached not only by ethnicity, but in history.  She noted that Golda Meir walked through DUS and that this history belongs to the entire community.  She pointed out that she sits at the DUS living room every Sunday to read and watch the community.  She noted her lunch is a $5 hot dog and drink, which is pretty affordable.  Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede stated that she listens to the stories told by people of all ethnicities.  She has met young adults that bring their grandparents back so they could see DUS again.  She said that DUS is a real treasure and believes the author of the article missed the point.  Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede considers DUS the Jewel of the West.  From her observations on a weekly basis, she sees that the community feels part of it.
