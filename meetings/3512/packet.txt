September 2023 Code of Conduct Revisions

September 13, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt revisions to the Customer Code of Conduct.

DIRECTORS
Kate Williams, Chair, Operations and Safety Committee
Michael Guzman, Director – District C
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Act, Article 9 of Title 32, Colorado Revised Statutes, authorizes the district to develop,
maintain, and operate a mass transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.
In order to provide for personal safety, convenience, and comfort of all customers, the agency has
established a Customer Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules prohibiting certain conduct that may
adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles, facilities, or property. To enforce this
Code, RTD has established a Service Suspension Policy (Policy) setting forth procedures and
enforcement guidelines.
The Code and Policy are tools in an overarching strategy to maintain a welcoming transit environment
for all RTD employees and customers.
At the June 2023 Board Meeting, following months of discussion and on-going feedback, the Board of
Directors adopted a revised Code as well as a new Policy. At that meeting, Director Guzman had
planned to offer a series of amendments to the Code. However, to afford the Board more time to
consider the amendments and to follow the best practice of having recommended actions first
considered by a standing committee, Director Guzman agreed to withhold offering amendments at the
June meeting. Subsequently, Director Williams, as Chair of the Operations and Safety Committee
committed to considering select amendments to the Code from Director Guzman at an Operations and
Safety Committee meeting. The July Operations and Safety Committee agenda was too full to
accommodate the discussion, so the September meeting was selected by Committee Chair Williams as
the meeting to hear proposed amendments as a recommended action. Per the RTD Board of Director
Bylaws, the Chair of a Committee may place items on the agenda. (Article VI, Section 1, b).

DISCUSSION
This recommended action seeks Board approval to modify the Code with four straightforward changes to
four rules in order to:
•
•
•

Clarify rules
Simplify language
Eliminate redundancy

Director Guzman developed these proposed changes based on community and customer feedback and
met with the General Manager and CEO on Monday, July 24, 2023 to discuss his proposed changes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no substantive financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

Proposed Amendments to the Respect the Ride/Code of Conduct Rules
Introduction:
Thank you for your willingness to review these suggestions and engage in discussion about the merit of each.
Below I have proposed five amendments to the Code of Conduct as approved by the Board at the June 2023
meeting.
For the purposes of the following suggested amendments, strikes or modifications all reference the finalized
code of conduct document on file with the Board Office.
Each proposed amendment is contained on its own page in this document and I have included the rule number,
as well as the rule as written prior to the June changes, the current language of the rule as updated following
the Board’s June changes, and my proposed amendment in red. I have also provided some brief rationale for
each proposed change.
The first three of the following are important to constituents of District C. There is one more amendment I
offer for consideration, as I believe it is a commonsense adjustment which will assist in clarifying and simplifying
the rule for the benefit of employees and customers. I hope all will be considered by the Operations and Safety
Committee and reviewed by staff for any advice or legal requirements.

Code of Conduct Rule: 27
Previous Rule 27 Prior to June 2023 Changes:
Intentionally occupying more than one seat of an RTD vehicle or facility (subject to ADA reasonable
modification; see Code Section IV).
Current Rule 27:
Intentionally occupying more than one seat of an RTD vehicle or facility when seating is limited, and customer
demand is high. This section is subject to ADA reasonable modification; see Code Section IV.
Proposed Amendment to Rule 27:
Intentionally occupying more than one seat of an RTD vehicle or facility when seating is limited. , and
customer demand is high. This section is subject to ADA reasonable modification; see Code Section IV
Rationale:
●

●

The amendment is for clarity, not to change the intent.
It is based on multiple constituents and stakeholder groups stating that “customer demand is high” was
confusing; if “seating is limited” is clearly stated.
Removes redundancy

Code of Conduct Rule: 28
Previous Rule 28 Prior to June 2023 Changes:
Entering or remaining on RTD property or vehicle while a person is so severely impaired by the consumption of
alcohol or by the taking of any drugs that the person is unable to function safely in the environment of a transit
system.
Current Rule 28:
Entering or remaining in an RTD vehicle or facility while significantly and severely impaired by the consumption
of alcohol or the use of drugs, thus impacting the ability to safely function in a transit system environment.

Entering or remaining in an RTD vehicle or facility while so significantly and severely impaired by the
consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs that the customer is unable thus impacting the ability to safely
function in a transit system environment use RTD’s transportation services.
Rationale:
● This is based on customer feedback
● “Impacting” invites even more subjectivity and this amendment offers some clarity.
● We want to encourage individuals to use RTD when we know that public transit is part of public safety
campaigns, e.g. - NYE & “Don’t drink and drive!”

“Not limited to” is unnecessary.
Clarity, reduces conflict and helps all stakeholders.
This type of explicit behavior, here-in defined, is covered under rules against harassment - as it is to cause
another to fear for their safety.
Also it is redundant, but a clarified version.
See Rule # 15 - Current Customer Code of Conduct.
Engaging in harassm ent , sexual harassment, or bullying. This includes offensive behavior, unwelcome conduct
of a sexual nature, or abusive, repeated conduct directed toward an individual because of their sex, race, color,
national origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, ancestry, age, military
status, disability, genetic information, or any other status protected by law. (emphasis added)

Proposed Amendment Four

1.D.1.b

Customer Code of Conduct
The Regional Transportation District makes lives better through connections, whether that is connecting a customer
with their final destination or the connections that happen with others on the system. To support all types of
connections, RTD asks its customers to follow a set of behavioral guidelines called Respect the Ride.
Respect the Ride focuses on providing a safe, convenient, and enjoyable experience for all customers,
while also discouraging disruptive or antisocial behaviors.
Being respectful of other customers and considerate to RTD’s employees does not take more than common courtesy.

Purpose:
RTD is committed to offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective transportation throughout
the District to all constituents.
RTD strives to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and has equal access to transportation. In order to provide for
the safety, convenience, and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth
rules prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles (including
RTD buses, Access-a-Ride vehicles, FlexRide vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail vehicles), facilities
(including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters, plazas and fountains, and administrative,
operational, and maintenance facilities), or property.
Prior to enforcement, RTD will make every attempt to first educate a person on conduct prohibited by
this Code. However, any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement ranging from a
verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5: “Enforcement”).
Conduct prohibited by this Code is subject to reasonable modification under the Americans with Disabilities Act (see
Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”)

Authority:
This Code of Conduct was initially approved on December 20, 2016, by RTD’s Board of Directors and thereafter
amended on July 21, 2020, and June 27, 2023.

Prohibited Conduct:
A person, including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever (including but not limited to companies,
clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is prohibited from committing, attempting to
commit, or assisting any other person or combination of persons to commit, the following acts in or on any RTD
vehicle, facility, or property.

maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to, and benefits from, its services.
RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and procedures applicable to its transportation
services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure accessibility for people with disabilities.
There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility.
A modification to these policies and procedures may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has
access to our services.
Examples of reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under Accessibility. When making a
reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:

Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility, or property after being ordered to do
so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement personnel.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may also, or instead, be issued a suspension

time pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy and procedures.
A person ordered to leave or suspended from RTD property will not be entitled to any refund of unused

Suspension or orders to exit RTD property may be appealed pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy
and procedures.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2024 Service Change Proposals

September 13, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the January
2024 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new
work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
As stated in previous reports, staffing levels continue to be the primary challenge in increasing service
levels to match those identified in the System Optimization Plan (SOP). Considering the agency’s current
staffing levels and anticipated attrition, the January 2024 Service Change recommendations are
designed to have minimal impacts to staffing levels. The recommended changes to service are centered
on improving system performance and CBA compliance related to respite time.
DISCUSSION
The recommended service changes herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments
centered on system maintenance. Adjustments to bus schedules are aimed at improving on-time
performance on services such as the 15/15L – East Colfax routes, which will see construction related to
the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit project. Rail line schedule analyses are also recommended to address
system network connections and signal system delays experienced in the downtown area. This
recommended service change includes schedule adjustments on over 20 routes/lines of service to
improve service reliability and network connectivity.
In alignment with Strategic Plan priorities, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and recognizing
RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time performance,
maintaining compliance with the agency’s CBA with ATU.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD service standards
• Effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Q1/Q2 2023 Safety Performance Review

September 13, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Dan McClain, Chief Safety Officer, Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
At RTD, the safety of customers and employees is paramount; work is constantly underway to create
and maintain a safe transit environment. As the recipient of federal funds for transit operations, RTD is
subject to federal rules and regulations regarding system safety.
Regulatory Environment
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) require transit
agencies to develop safety management systems describing their approach to safety and compliance
with federal safety rules and regulations. The FRA governs commuter rail and the FTA governs light rail.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) governs bus.
FRA
The FRA requires a System Safety Program Plan (SSP) focused on reducing railroad accidents, incidents,
injuries and fatalities. The FRA regulations distinguish between reportable and recordable accidents or
incidents. Reporting requirements under the SSPP fall under three categories:
Highway rail grade crossing incident: Any impact between on-track equipment and highway user
at a highway rail-grade crossing
Train Accident: Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving
operation of rail on-track equipment that results in reportable damages greater than the reporting
threshold, which is $11,500 for 2023
Casualties: Any death of a railroad employee or injury, occupational illness of a railroad employee
not associated with train accidents or highway rail grade incidents
FTA
While the FTA retains the regulatory authority for bus and light rail, it has delegated its responsibilities as
the State Safety Oversight Agency to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). In that role, the
CPUC oversees the agency’s compliance with the required Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP). The PTASP must include processes and procedures to implement a Safety Management
System (SMS). SMS is a comprehensive, collaborative approach that brings together management and

labor to control risk and to detect and correct safety problems. The SMS is informed by safety
performance goals set against realistic, data-driven safety performance indictors and targets.
The FTA has issued several new notices of proposed rulemaking to support the requirements in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). RTD has participated in the development of comments on these
proposed rules through the American Public Transportation Association.
DISCUSSION
In reviewing this discussion item, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success.
Q1/Q2 Safety Data
Regarding Q1/Q2 2023 safety data for all modes:
On-the-Job Injuries (OJIs)
OJIs increased significantly in the first half of 2023. The 79% increase is due mostly to reports
of exposure to illicit drug smoke. Of the 388 first reports of injury, 57% (223) were from
exposure to illicit drug smoke. This has increased the total cases per 100 employees to 33.66, up
from 19.55 in 2022. Eighty-two percent of the exposures to illicit drug smoke are “report only,”
which means no medical cost or lost time is paid from workers’ compensation. The next leading
cause of OJIs are attributable to slips, trips, falls, and strains. During the first half of 2023, there
was a 39% decrease in slip and fall injuries, and a 74% increase in injuries from strains.
Additionally, there was a 45% improvement in the number of lost time days due to OJIs. For
system reliability for the first half of 2023, there has been a 7.7% decrease.
Starting in January of 2021, FTA required transit agencies to report assaults to the National
Transit Database (NTD) using a new definition of assault from the BIL. These assaults are
categorized by three areas: type of worker, type of assault, and location. During the first half of
2023 RTD experienced137 assaults.
Commuter Rail
During the first half of 2023, for the entirety of the commuter rail system, there were eight total
accidents and incidents. Of the eight, six were reportable accidents and two were recordable
incidents.
Commuter rail also tracks rule violations, station overruns, near misses and trespasser incidents.
In the first half of 2023, commuter rail experienced 33 rule violations and station overruns,
compared to 46 for the full year of 2022. Commuter rail experienced 44 near misses in 2023,
which compares with 36 near misses for the first half of 2022.
In addition to complying with safety reporting requirements, the FRA also frequently conducts
audits and inspections to verify the safety of the commuter rail system. In the first half of 2023,

Packet Pg. 32

1.E.2

RTD experienced 18 defects, and two violations, an increase from four defects and zero
violations in 2022.
Light Rail
During the first half of 2023, light rail experienced 15 reportable events, compared to 33 for the
first half of 2022. Under CPUC regulation, the agency must report within two hours events
concerning:
A fatality at the scene; or where a person is confirmed dead within 30 days of the
accident
Serious injuries requiring immediate medical attention
Substantial property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
An evacuation due to life safety reasons
A collision at a grade crossing resulting in a serious injury or fatality
Any derailment of a rail transit vehicle
A runaway train
A collision between a rail transit vehicle and a second rail transit vehicle, or a rail transit
non-revenue vehicle
The majority of reportable events are attributable to grade crossing collisions, which can occur
anywhere on the system where the rail and street cross at the same grade. Most grade crossing
collisions occur in the downtown loop, which is “street running” and unprotected by gates. The
agency continues to see improved performance with regard to red signal violations. In the first
half of 2023, there were 10. In the first half of 2022, there were 14 red signal violations.
In June 2022, the CPUC issued a new 24-hour reporting requirement for nine types of hazards:
Activation failure, partial activation, or false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing
warning system
Broken rail causing impassable track
Broken Messenger or Contact wire, or Overhead Contact System wire
Train separation (train uncoupling) in revenue service
Incapacitated train operator in revenue service
Red signal violations
Vehicle door opening on wrong side, opening away from station platforms, or opening
during train movement
Near miss collision with employee, contractor, or other individual including trespassers on
the rail right-of-way
Any other hazard that meets a defined high risk or serious risk assessment code
For the first half of 2023, the agency reported 28 hazards. For the last half of 2022, the agency
reported 54 additional hazards in 2022, of which 52 were near misses.

Packet Pg. 33

1.E.2

Bus
For the metric of preventable accidents, in the first half 2023 there were 553 bus accidents, of
which 171 were preventable. For the first half of 2022, there were 528 accidents of which 163
were preventable.
2023 PTASP Safety Goals
Pursuant to the 2023 Board-approved PTASP, RTD established a series of safety performance goals. The
goals and the performance through Q1/Q2 2023 are as follows:
2023 Goal
3% increase in system reliability
1.00 preventable accident per 100,000 miles
5% reduction of lost time days due to OJIs
5% reduction of OJIs

5% reduction of slip and fall injuries
5% reduction of injuries from strains

Q1/Q2 2023 Performance
7.7% decrease
1.39 accident per 100,000 miles
45% reduction
79% increase, predominantly due to
exposure to illicit drug smoke
exposure as noted herein
39% decrease
74% increase

Managing Risk
The agency has adopted an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Framework to address safety issues.
The implementation of an ORM demonstrates a commitment to safety and unifies management systems
and other activities through a formal, continuous, data-driven, agency-wide approach to manage risk and
assure effectiveness of risk controls.
SSP Activities
The annual SSP internal assessment process is intended to measure the efficacy of elements of the
agency’s commuter rail system program to ensure they are providing the intended results. The 2023
assessment is currently underway. RTD and Denver Transit Operators are conducting a joint emergency
drill near Denver International Airport and are coordinating a multi-agency response in September 2023.
The agency’s required fatigue risk management program, a component of the SSP, was submitted to the
FRA in July 2023. There is a three-year implementation window for this program.
PTASP Activities
The CPUC approved the 2024 PTASP on September 1, 2023.
PTASP safety assurance activities include an event investigation train-the-trainer project. A new course
is being developed to provide trainers in each operational division with the relevant skills to conduct
event investigation training as part of the implementation of new event investigation policy and
procedures.
Internal safety reviews (ISRs) of the light rail system are conducted each winter and summer, and the
CPUC conducts state safety oversight audits each spring and fall. As a result of safety events and

Packet Pg. 34

1.E.2

findings from ISRs and CPUC audits, corrective action plans (CAPs) are developed and managed to
closure. Starting with the 2020 internal safety review and audit cycle, the number of CAPs increased as
did the efforts to manage and close these. As of the end of June 2023, RTD had 29 open CAPs and
closed 48 CAPs.
