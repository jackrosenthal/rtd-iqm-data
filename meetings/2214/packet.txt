BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 2, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

July 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

2015 - 2020 Strategic Budget Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.

Fiscal

BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update annually
a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District. The
other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time period.
These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have adequate
resources to meet cash flow needs.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits, and
to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to operate within the
forecast of revenues available for their completion and operation.
The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2015-2020 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2015-2020 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.

DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2014 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best
estimates at this time. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
on July 8th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on July 15th.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2015-2020 projected cash flow through the extension of
the 2014 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Amended Budget 2014” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, and reductions, eliminations or
deferrals of SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this
period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2015-2020 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $119.3 million in 2015 is forecast to remain flat from 2014 due to no
expected growth in ridership. The SBP assumes zero ridership increase through 2020.
In future years, fare revenue includes a 10% fare rate increase in 2016 and 2019 per
Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years. No fare rate
increases have occurred since 2011. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the June quarterly update from the CU-Leeds School of
Business for the years 2014-2020. (Line 2)
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and recent
congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price Index (CPI)
(obtained from the Colorado Legislative Council) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Operating expense:
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates of 2.5% in 2015-2020. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, Denver Union Station, and the Free MetroRide are
allocated from Base to FasTracks, and thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 then escalated at the CPI rate for 2018-2020. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.12/gallon, which is the 2014 lock price, and then
escalated at the national CPI rate of 2.1% in 2015-2020. Gasoline is budgeted at
$3.54/gallon, which is the same as used in the 2014 Amended Budget, and then
escalated at the national CPI rate of 2.1% in 2015-2020. (Line 11)
 Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense projects”)
are included. This is detailed in Exhibit III. (Line 12)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System, is
increased by the CPI rate serially each year beginning in 2014. (Line 14)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and a forecasted rise in interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 17)
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year
(both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Projected
interest payments on future debt issues use current municipal interest rate forward curves
incorporated in debt amortization schedules. (Line 18)
 Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects and
replacements. This is detailed in Exhibit II. (Line 21)

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

 Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund,
staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and/or capital replacement
fund be maintained at a minimum $3.0 million each year until each fund reaches the
minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur no later than 2019. (Lines 23,
24, 33, and 34)
 Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in accordance
with fleet schedules. (Line 26)
 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. (Line
27)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted yearend fund balance. During 2018, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to
reach if not exceed $30 million. (Line 32)
Note: The CLC inflation rate (CPI) is 2.5% 2015-2020, while the national CPI (applied to fuel) is 2.1%
in 2015-2020.

Exhibit II
Exhibit II attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned capital projects during the
SBP period.
Exhibit III
Exhibit III attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned operating, maintenance and
administrative projects during the SBP period.
Exhibit IV
Exhibit IV attached to this document is a listing of capital and operating projects deferred from
2015 that were submitted for consideration during the SBP development process. The SBP
was balanced largely by deferral to 2016-2018 of several projects requested for 2015. In
2016-2018, the SBP generates sufficient cash flow to support these 2015 deferred projects.
Exhibit V
Exhibit V attached to this document is a chart of capital projects by type for the current and
last three SBP periods.
Exhibit VI
Exhibit VI attached to this document is a chart of operating and maintenance projects by type
for the current and last three SBP periods.
The 2015-2020 SBP planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI
rate starting in 2015:

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

to final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI
impacts are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements
(repairs, replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be
provided and a statement from the Planning Department is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax
revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an
impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2015
budget period.
Current key financial indicators for the SBP are:

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2015-2020 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by staff
and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2015-2020 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the SBP
identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2015 budget process
and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2015
Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2015-2020 SBP.
This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible delay in the
2015 budget process.

Per the U.S. Department of Transportation guidance and regulations, all recipients
of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1 964 and its related laws and regulations. As a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) submits an annual assurance
of compliance with Title VI as a part of RTD’s annual submission of Certifications
and Assurances, as required per 49 CFR part 21.7. Accordingly, RTD’s Planning
Department will review the district’s services in its entirety for compliance with
Title VI. This review will include a review of the Strategic Budget Plan as
necessary, pursuant to ensuring non-discrimination on basis of race, color and
national origin. Should any Title VI violations become evident, remedial and/or
mitigating measures will be developed to restore equity and achieve compliance
with Title VI.

construction with an updated standard product. RTD’s engineering staff
has created a conceptual design that considers lessons learned over the
past fifteen years, and which incorporates good materials that are durable
and easy to maintain. The conceptual design has been favorably checked
for vulnerability and ease of maintenance by colleagues from the Safety,
Security & Facilities Department, and has also been satisfactorily assessed
by a manufacturer for constructability. The project’s intent is to solicit final
design and construction proposals by manufacturers and installers.

Requesting a vehicle to be used as a response/installation/maintenance

type box (i.e., ambulance type) to be used as a clean work area for the
fiber work. A clean area is needed so that outside contaminants are kept
out of the fiber splicing area. The modular unit should be equipped with a
generator or DC/AC inverter so that 110VAC is available in the back for the
fiber splicing equipment. Also, the unit should should be climate controlled
so that the operation of fiber repair can be optimally performed. Also, the
vehicle needs to have railroad hi-rail capabilities. Since most of RTD's fiber
backbone is along rail alignments, a vehicle of this type is needed to
access areas where regular road vehicles cannot get to.

Asset Management Program Planning and Implementation
District Shops - Operations Center
Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors
and maintains things of value to an entity or group. IT asset management is
the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making
for the IT environment. This is also one of the processes defined within IT
service management. The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for the current and
future computing size of the District. A more robust integrated system is
needed for hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration control,
and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes the tracking of computers,
servers, software, mobile devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops,

Call-n-Ride Tablet Replacement
District Shops - Operations Center
The Call-n-Ride vehicles are equipped with DLT rugged mobile computer
tablets. These same DLT tablets are used by RideChecker personnel to
gather infield ridership information, being managed by the same group.
Currently, there are a total of 67 mobile tablets in use: 52 Call-n-Ride and
15 RideChecker. In 2013, 20 machines were replaced with the Panasonic
H2 Tablet, leaving 47 needing replacement in 2015, with 15 in dire need.
Even though the tablets are ruggedized, they still have a higher break rate
than a standard PC that resides within an office setting. The total number
of on-shelf inventory needs to increase to accommodate time involved with
break/fix full turnaround. An additional 8 tablets are needed in order to
reduce service interruption that has been an issue for several years. Also,
the unit hardware will be set to a 3 year life cycle. Request is based on
increased unit numbers: 55 Call-n-Ride, and 20 RideChecker for a total of
75 in service and ready inventory tablets.
Client-Level Encryption Software for Portable Devices
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a
way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption doesn't prevent
hacking but it reduces the likelihood that the hacker will be able to read the
data that is encrypted. On all workstations: provide users with an easy to
use solution for encrypting client-side files, where user works with sensitive
data (ex. SPI). For portable workstations (ex. laptops): provide whole disk
encryption. Centrally managed keys will allow users to encrypt data on their
workstations or in files, but allow authorized RTD administrators with the
key to unencrypt/read information on corporate managed devices if
required (ex. for a records request) or in an emergency.

Enterprise Content Management (ECM) + 2 FTE

As RTD continues to grow, so does the complexity of managing records

Enterprise Records and Information department is conducting a
comprehensive assessment in 2014 (4 phase ECM project) of the
organization’s as-is records and informational assets processes. The first
phase of the assessment is to construct a holistic review of the business
needs, review best practices, define risks and probable
organization/cultural changes, and construct the roadmap for moving
forward in the process. Based on the outcome of this study, and with the
approval and support of Senior Leadership, the other phases include
Solution Development, Solution Deployment, and Solution Support. This is
not specifically a software implementation project, although that may be
part of the ultimate solution. It will also require consulting services and
probable addition to RTD staff. Much depends on the outcome of the study
and the direction provided by the Senior Leadership team. Ultimately, our
goal is to implement an enterprise wide ECM and also migrate all records
and key artifacts from legacy systems and shared drives. This must be
done in alignment with RTD’s corporate taxonomy and must follow the
agency’s corporate retention schedule and policies. The migration of
existing records is a big task, but must be completed to align the various
departments into a single tool and ensure centralized governance of RTD’s
record management policies and guidelines.

TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the past 8 years at
RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and limited in its
functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
Fastracks, and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to collect
customer feedback that is not integrated. The recommendation from the
Smart Card Business Process Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD
procure and implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet
the needs of all departments and projects. The first phase (2015) of this
project is to initiate an enterpise-level study to perform a needs analysis,
develop processes and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and future needs of
RTD. The second phase (2016) is to purchase and implement an enterpise
CRM. If the CRM study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding would drop and
be replaced with annual expense and IT would only need to request 1 new
FTE.

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District
information and computing services. A wide array of departments and
applications use these storage units to store mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a technology
consisting of computer components and recording media used to retain
digital information. It is a core function and fundamental component of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what
manipulates raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but
larger and cheaper options farther away. In computing, a portfolio of
storage products, including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software
are required to run the Enterprise.

IT Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that
monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy
violations and produces reports to a management station. An IDS can
detect and distinguish between different types of legitimate or suspicious
network traffic, and flag harmful traffic to administrators. If the software is
prevention enabled (an intrusion prevention system, or IPS), it can block
the harmful traffic before it becomes an issue. In addition, organizations
use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSes) for other
purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting
existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. An
IDPS is a must-have tool for any serious in-depth computer security plan.

Load Balancer Replacement
District Shops - Operations Center
For redundancy, the load balancers at RTD are grouped in a pair. RTD
utilizes a common piece of network equipment to spread resource
demands across multiple application instances so that if one instance is
overburdened or fails, there is another instance to handle the load. One
pair of load balancers serve internal applications such as ERP, TIES,
SharePoint and Email, while another pair serves our public applications
such as Trip Planner, rtd-denver.com, and Oracle iModules. Because each
set of applications is supported by two servers, each server in the pair can
be replaced without causing an outage or interruption to the business.

Mobile Device Application Development
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Develop a single customer-facing mobile application (for iOS, Android, and
other mobile devices) that will allow customers to easily access real-time
predictive information, schedule information, rider alert information,
purchase bus/light rail tickets, pay parking fees, as well as other
functionality relevant to RTD riders. Apps will allow RTD to tap into
powerful device functionality, such as geolocation, push notifications, and
offline usage. In order to guarantee a high-quality product that provides
useful, accurate, comprehensive, and controlled RTD information, an RTDowned app needs to be created. Surveys conducted by RTD’s Market
Research Department have determined that customers frequently ask for
apps to communicate pertinent, customized service information. RTD will
look to partner with an experienced mobile apps developer to build the
initial app. Our criteria will be to select a vendor or platform that can
develop a device-agnostic app (compatible across most mobile operating
systems) and that allows RTD to maintain ownership of the app and its
source code (leaving us with the option to bring later-stage development,
enhancements, and maintenance in-house).

Currently we have a 48 strand fiber optic cable that runs between District
Shops and DUS. The current alignment passes through a triangle of BNSF
property for which we have a 20 year lease that expires in 2014. We
propose to reroute the mainline NM ductbank that currently passes by
District Shops on its way to 124th. This will provide us a path to DUS that
avoids the BNSF parcel. We will then install a new 144 strand fiber optic
cable between District Shops and DUS. This data link is crucial to our data

Traveler Information System (TIS)/Real-Time Passenger Information
(RTPI) + 2 FTE
Districtwide
With the implementation of the INIT's CAD/AVL system for fixed-route
buses, RTD is able to provide up-to-date predicted arrival information (also
known as real-time passenger information) to riders. Studies completed at
agencies that have implemented real-time information delivery
demonstrate that the delivery of this critical information to riders will
strongly increase overall satisfaction with public transit, decrease wait time,
increase transit trips per week, increase the feeling of safety, and increase
ridership by reducing the feeling of uncertainty that hinders infrequent/nonriders from using transit. In addition, incident and delay information can be
captured and delivered to internal RTD departments for greater efficiency.
Riders who have access to real-time information feel more in control of
their trip and perceive a shorter wait time, leading to an increase in overall
satisfaction. In order to ensure that riders have access to this timesensitive information, real-time information must be disseminated to the
most relevant, reliable, and widely accessible communication channels to
meet the diverse needs our riders. In addition, the information delivered
must be simple, timely, relevant, accurate, easily understood, and targeted.
The exponential increase in mobile internet usage over the last 5 years has
changed the way in which transit agencies deliver real-time information.
Analysts predict that more people will browse the internet on their
mobile/tablet devices than on traditional desktop/laptop computers in 2015
making the delivery of real-time information on mobile devices an essential
part of RTD's communications strategy. A customer panel focus group
conducted in Q1 2014 found that mobile apps are highly desirable for the
majority of RTD customers. An app incorporating real-time information,
push notifications, intelligent trip planning, and personalization or
recognition of returning customer behavior is highly sought after. A realtime information delivery plan will be formulated in 2014. Expenses include
warranty and IT staff to manage and a business owner.

The initial implementation of RTD's enterprise content management system
and web content platform (Oracle WebCenter Sites) is planned in 2014.
Oracle WebCenter Sites will support the development of a new www.rtddenver.com website to enable the Communications Department and other
business users to easily create and manage contextually relevant and
targeted interactive online experiences across web, mobile, and social
channels. The WebCenter product will enable RTD to deliver a compelling
digital experience to customers by deploying and managing sophisticated
and engaging websites across digital channels. This solution automates the
process of managing the web – including business-user content authoring,
delivery of high-scale dynamic sites, content targeting and optimization,
delivering accessible code, user-generated content, social networking
integration, end-user personalization, and mobile content delivery. This
product will provide Marketing with new targeting capabilities to deliver
customized messages to defined audiences to increase engagement and
content syndication. This flexible, scalable online platform will also integrate
easily with other enterprise technologies such as business intelligence,
social relationship management, customer relationship management, and
more. Going forward, the Digital Marketing team will also require 2 FTEs to
implement, support, and build out the product with the newly available
features and tools, manage content, and design/develop the initial set-up
and ongoing maintenance and enhancements. Capital will be required in
2015 to fund Oracle consultants/SMEs to support second and third phases

Bike Parking and Accessibility Plan Implementation
Districtwide
Implementation of the recommendations from the Bike Parking and
Accessibility Plan (in progress, to be completed summer 2014). These will
include improvements to transit facilities to make them more bike friendly,
for example, signage indicating where bike parking is located on the site
and roadway markings that allow bikes to move through transit facilities
more safely. In addition, new types of bike parking will be recommended for
demonstration projects and budget will be needed to site, purchase, and
install the bike parking.

Elevator Monitoring System @ US36 Corridor
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit
FM installed (2) Golder monitoring modules in April of 2013 at the
Broomfield bridge elevators as a test project. The monitors send an email
alarm as soon as an event in the elevator affects the safety chain of the
elevator controller. The SCC and FM are notified when an event occurs so
that they can start the call out process with Kone Elevators and get the
elevator back into service as soon as possible. So far the alarm and
notification has worked well and this project would increase the use of the
current technology and create a more reliable and accessible elevator unit
at all the sites along US36.

Consultant Support for District-Wide Best Practices
Districtwide
RTD's District Historian is responsible for creating District-wide best
practices at multiple levels including at the Executive/SLT level, the Middle
Manager level and at the Operater level. In 2014, the focus is on creating a
high level Executive/SLT focused best practices document. In 2015, the
intent is to have a more focused, detailed best practices document with
input from all levels (Middle Manager and Operator Levels) and from all
departments. To accomplish this task the District Historian will need
consultant resources to conduct a statistically valid survey of RTD
departments and proviide support to help produce more detailed
documentation of Best Practices. This survey would be run with support
from RTD's Marketing Department and would have a sample size of 2500
to 2700.

RTD typically conducts a license plate survey at each of the District’s 78
Park-n-Rides on an annual basis. Information from this survey is used to
calibrate the travel demand and ridership forecasting model. In order to
perform the annual surveys, RTD requires assistance from a contractor in
collecting data from each of its 78 Park-n-Rides. These data are the
license plate numbers from each vehicle parked in each Park-n-Ride on a
given weekday. This data has been collected annually since 2003.

Title/Description

Location

As RTD moves forward with the implementation of Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) and Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) through the
TOD Pilot Program and other TOD/TOC projects, there is a need to fund
due diligence costs for preparing RFQs/RFPs and/or responding to
unsolicited proposals for development on RTD land. Lead items that need
to be addressed in advance of releasing RFQs/RFPs, in response to
proposals from local jurisdictions, or in response to an unsolicited
proposals from developers include: obtaining land title commitments,
conducting Alta surveys to define land parcel boundaries, Phase 1 and 2
environmental studies, geotechnical work, and in some cases appraisals to
determine fair market value of RTD property. TOD Predevelopment Due
Diligence has been identified in the SBP since 2014. Based on the
experience from 2013/2014, the budget for due diligence tasks has been
adjusted upward from previous funding levels.

Title/Description

Location

Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors
and maintains things of value to an entity or group. IT asset management is
the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making
for the IT environment. This is also one of the processes defined within IT
service management. The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for the current and
future computing size of the District. A more robust integrated system is
needed for hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration control,
and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes the tracking of computers,
servers, software, mobile devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops,
monitors, etc.

immediate and future analytical reporting needs across the agency. This
would require additional resources to continue to support BI initiatives of
RTD and maximize our return on investment in our BI platform: - 2
additional FTEs for IT BI team to help standardize and maintain functional
data and support ongoing report development and end-user training. Capital to fund development of an enterprise-level BI assessment and
strategy in 2015. - Capital to source consultants to support report and
dashboard development in 2015 and train IT and super-users to further
develop internal expertise. Furthermore, RTD's business intelligence
platform will be migrated from Oracle Exalogic to Exalytics servers (RTD
currently has 2 Exalytic servers for production and test). Exalytics servers
are specifically designed to deliver high performance analytics, modeling
and planning and were purchased by RTD to support future development
and growth of our BI platform. This request is to purchase a third server for
DR.

Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a
way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption doesn't prevent
hacking but it reduces the likelihood that the hacker will be able to read the
data that is encrypted. On all workstations: provide users with an easy to
use solution for encrypting client-side files, where user works with sensitive
data (ex. SPI). For portable workstations (ex. laptops): provide whole disk
encryption. Centrally managed keys will allow users to encrypt data on their
workstations or in files, but allow authorized RTD administrators with the
key to unencrypt/read information on corporate managed devices if
required (ex. for a records request) or in an emergency.

Datacenter Cloud Study (WO)
District Shops - Operations Center
A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated
components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It
generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data
communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning,
fire suppression) and various security devices. Large data centers are
industrial scale operations using as much electricity as a small town. RTD
remains as dependent as ever on its primary data center located at District
Shops to meet its efficiency and growth objectives. Rigorous data center
capacity planning and management is critical to serving today's enterprise.
At their core, these disciplines are required to insure that the data center
can accommodate both the expected and unexpected needs of the
business. The movement toward distributed computing infrastructures has
eroded the transparency between business requirements and data center
capacity. With systems now spread across multiple physical as well as
logical elements all connected by a shared network within a shared data
center, it is significantly more difficult to take "vertical slices" through the
infrastructure which business-centric capacity planning and management
requires. RTD's District Shops data center has nearly reached the number
of equipment / devices it can reasonably store without causing costly
damage (outages / physical damage) to RTD. In order to mitigate / reduce
the risk of costly damage, RTD must look to expand the data center in a
cost-effective, resource-efficient way. RTD IT wishes to conduct a study to
explore such options.

Title/Description

Location

As RTD continues to grow, so does the complexity of managing records
and informational artifacts across the agency’s departments and systems.
Enterprise Records and Information department is conducting a
comprehensive assessment in 2014 (4 phase ECM project) of the
organization’s as-is records and informational assets processes. The first
phase of the assessment is to construct a holistic review of the business
needs, review best practices, define risks and probable
organization/cultural changes, and construct the roadmap for moving
forward in the process. Based on the outcome of this study, and with the
approval and support of Senior Leadership, the other phases include
Solution Development, Solution Deployment, and Solution Support. This is
not specifically a software implementation project, although that may be
part of the ultimate solution. It will also require consulting services and
probable addition to RTD staff. Much depends on the outcome of the study
and the direction provided by the Senior Leadership team. Ultimately, our
goal is to implement an enterprise wide ECM and also migrate all records
and key artifacts from legacy systems and shared drives. This must be
done in alignment with RTD’s corporate taxonomy and must follow the
agency’s corporate retention schedule and policies. The migration of
existing records is a big task, but must be completed to align the various
departments into a single tool and ensure centralized governance of RTD’s
record management policies and guidelines.
Enterprise Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Study/Replacement
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the past 8 years at
RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and limited in its
functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
Fastracks, and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to collect
customer feedback that is not integrated. The recommendation from the
Smart Card Business Process Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD
procure and implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet
the needs of all departments and projects. The first phase (2015) of this
project is to initiate an enterpise-level study to perform a needs analysis,
develop processes and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and future needs of
RTD. The second phase (2016) is to purchase and implement an enterpise
CRM. If the CRM study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding would drop and
be replaced with annual expense and IT would only need to request 1 new
FTE.
Exadata Storage Expansion
District Shops - Operations Center
Over the last 5 years, RTD made a strategic decision to invest in an Oracle
Exadata database solution. The Oracle Exadata Database machine is
engineered to be the highest performing and most available platform for
running the Oracle Database. Oracle Exadata runs all types of database
workloads including Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), Data
Warehousing (DW) and consolidation of mixed workloads. Simple and fast
to implement, the Oracle Exadata Database machine powers and protects
your most important databases and is the ideal foundation for a
consolidated database cloud. Expansion of the Exadata storage is needed
in order to accommodate new systems coming online.

Fiber-optic lines are strands of optically pure glass as thin as a human hair
that carry digital information over long distances. Since 1990, when opticalamplification systems became commercially available, the
telecommunications industry has laid a vast network of intercity and
transoceanic fiber communication lines. Across the Denver Metro area,
there are a number of groups / organizations that share in the ownership of
existing fiber, i.e., RTD, CDOT, SCADA. This fiber is used by these
organizations to support major infrastructure projects including FasTracks,

Information Storage Unit Replacement
District Shops - Operations Center
RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District
information and computing services. A wide array of departments and
applications use these storage units to store mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a technology
consisting of computer components and recording media used to retain
digital information. It is a core function and fundamental component of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what
manipulates raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but
larger and cheaper options farther away. In computing, a portfolio of
storage products, including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software
are required to run the Enterprise.

IT Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that
monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy
violations and produces reports to a management station. An IDS can
detect and distinguish between different types of legitimate or suspicious
network traffic, and flag harmful traffic to administrators. If the software is
prevention enabled (an intrusion prevention system, or IPS), it can block
the harmful traffic before it becomes an issue. In addition, organizations
use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSes) for other
purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting
existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. An
IDPS is a must-have tool for any serious in-depth computer security plan.

Risk analysis is the process of defining and analyzing the dangers to
individuals, businesses and government agencies posed by potential
natural and human-caused adverse events. In IT, a risk analysis report can
be used to align technology-related objectives with a company's business
objectives. This process-driven analysis tool and repository will: - track,
compare, and prioritize risks for remediation, such as those that are
brought forward by security management tools, staff notification, security
incidents, new policy implementation, and audits - align IT risk priorities with
business risk priorities (ex. something that may look important to IT is not
as important to the business, or vice versa) - assist with communicating risk
areas to our business leadership, creating a risk "heat map," produce trend
reporting on active and resolved risks and incidents - give RTD leadership
an at-a-glance view into our technology risk landscape and strong/weak
areas before audits and other critical events - assist a compliance officer in
generating and tracking remediation plans to make sure that key issues are
resolved in a timely manner - apply analysis and metrics to measure
performance and enable continual improvement Having this infrastructure
in place will better position RTD as a whole to make intelligent decisions
about where and how to tackle technology-based security and compliance
risks.

Off-Site Back-Up Tape & Records Storage
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
RTD routinely creates and stores back-up tapes (storage media that is
used to back up all RTD’s electronic systems and electronic records for offline storage and archive data retrieval). RTD’s back-up tapes are currently
stored off-site at Iron Mountain (a vendor that provides storage and
retrieval services). On the other hand, physical records (paper records and
other media such as CDs) which represent important RTD information and
project documents are stored in an RTD operated storage facility. We are
requesting funds to contract a vendor to store and manage the retrieval of
both RTD’s back-up tapes and physical records at an off-site vendor
managed and owned facility. The initial task will be to conduct an RFP for
this work to ensure the most appropriate vendor is selected.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a
proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle
cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM,
and POS cards. Defined by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards
Council, the standard was created to increase controls around cardholder
data to reduce credit card fraud via its exposure. Validation of compliance
is done annually by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) that
creates a Report on Compliance (ROC) for organizations handling large
volumes of transactions, or by a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for
companies handling smaller volumes. This project aims to deploy a suite of
tools and services that allow RTD to achieve and maintain PCI, HIPAA,
and industry standards of compliance and security, and specifically does
the following: - scans systems to gather configuration data (ex. security
settings) - assesses configuration data to a pre-defined or custom-defined
baseline, policy, or regulatory requirement set and highlights gaps
(compliance checking) - performs an automated check for industry-known
weaknesses that might exist in our web applications and networked
systems (vulnerability testing) both internal to RTD and external (from
Internet); must be a qualified vendor under PCI - provides security technical
experts to perform penetration testing (meaning, a sanctioned hacking
exercise) against our network and web applications internally and externally
to assess our weaknesses and recommend solutions - monitors key
system files for changes that may be made by an unauthorized party (file
integrity monitoring) - aggregates and correlates system activity logs and
flags suspicious events for examination by a security analyst (security
information and event management).

Secure Coding Training for Web Application Developers
Project is to provide training for existing/new application developers on
secure coding practices. Secure coding/application security is the practice
of developing applications, whether for computers, mobile devices or the
web, in such a manner as to provide defense-in-depth against malicious
attacks (ex. hacking, malware). Best practices are in place for coders, but
many in the application development field either do not know these best
practices, or do not know them well enough to move quickly through the
development process enough to reach their application launch goals.

TIC Contact Center Integration and Enhancement
District Shops - Operations Center
The purpose of this project is to upgrade RTD's Telephone Information
Center (TIC) to industry-standard software to provide a better customer
interaction experience, improve call center agent performance and
satisfaction and eliminate our current piecemeal and outdated technology
and manual processes. This request speaks to upgrading only TIC, not the
Access-a-Ride call center, which is not an ideal scenario. At the time of this
request, we only have estimates based on converting TIC. While
converting both will be a bit more expensive, there are discounts that
become available to us, such as those based on number of concurrent
users, number of workstations, etc. In addition, a primary goal in a project
of this scope would be to eliminate out-of-date hardware and software,
which we would only be able to accomplish by converting both call centers.
This scenario is based on a product called Customer Interaction Center
(CIC) from Interactive Intelligence.

Title/Description

Location

With the implementation of the INIT's CAD/AVL system for fixed-route
buses, RTD is able to provide up-to-date predicted arrival information (also
known as real-time passenger information) to riders. Studies completed at
agencies that have implemented real-time information delivery
demonstrate that the delivery of this critical information to riders will
strongly increase overall satisfaction with public transit, decrease wait time,
increase transit trips per week, increase the feeling of safety, and increase
ridership by reducing the feeling of uncertainty that hinders infrequent/nonriders from using transit. In addition, incident and delay information can be
captured and delivered to internal RTD departments for greater efficiency.
Riders who have access to real-time information feel more in control of
their trip and perceive a shorter wait time, leading to an increase in overall
satisfaction. In order to ensure that riders have access to this timesensitive information, real-time information must be disseminated to the
most relevant, reliable, and widely accessible communication channels to
meet the diverse needs our riders. In addition, the information delivered
must be simple, timely, relevant, accurate, easily understood, and targeted.
The exponential increase in mobile internet usage over the last 5 years has
changed the way in which transit agencies deliver real-time information.
Analysts predict that more people will browse the internet on their
mobile/tablet devices than on traditional desktop/laptop computers in 2015
making the delivery of real-time information on mobile devices an essential
part of RTD's communications strategy. A customer panel focus group
conducted in Q1 2014 found that mobile apps are highly desirable for the
majority of RTD customers. An app incorporating real-time information,
push notifications, intelligent trip planning, and personalization or
recognition of returning customer behavior is highly sought after. A realtime information delivery plan will be formulated in 2014. Expenses include
warranty and IT staff to manage and a business owner.

The initial implementation of RTD's enterprise content management system
and web content platform (Oracle WebCenter Sites) is planned in 2014.
Oracle WebCenter Sites will support the development of a new www.rtddenver.com website to enable the Communications Department and other
business users to easily create and manage contextually relevant and
targeted interactive online experiences across web, mobile, and social
channels. The WebCenter product will enable RTD to deliver a compelling
digital experience to customers by deploying and managing sophisticated
and engaging websites across digital channels. This solution automates the
process of managing the web – including business-user content authoring,
delivery of high-scale dynamic sites, content targeting and optimization,
delivering accessible code, user-generated content, social networking
integration, end-user personalization, and mobile content delivery. This
product will provide Marketing with new targeting capabilities to deliver
customized messages to defined audiences to increase engagement and
content syndication. This flexible, scalable online platform will also integrate
easily with other enterprise technologies such as business intelligence,
social relationship management, customer relationship management, and
more. Going forward, the Digital Marketing team will also require 2 FTEs to
implement, support, and build out the product with the newly available
features and tools, manage content, and design/develop the initial set-up
and ongoing maintenance and enhancements. Capital will be required in
2015 to fund Oracle consultants/SMEs to support second and third phases
of the www.rtd-denver.com website development.

RTD is dedicated to providing the best transit experience to each and
every rider. Accessibility will continue to be a main concern of RTD. In the
web industry, web accessibility best practices and standards are defined by
Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act and the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines of the World Wide Web Consortium. Web
accessibility ensures that all customers and potential customers can use
digital media (specifically websites) to find information and perform tasks. A
website is only accessible when a person with disabilities can use it as
effectively as a person without disabilities. In 2013, RTD hired a vendor,
Interactive Accessibility, to perform a comprehensive assessment of our
various digital communication channels to provide recommendations and
remediation steps to allow RTD to develop an action plan to achieve
compliance. Interactive Accessibility provided a detailed report outlining the
steps that will need to be taken to certify that RTD’s main website, rtddenver.com, meets WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. Communications is
requesting funds to bring in an accessibility expert to complete the items
listed in Interactive Accessibility’s report to bring RTD’s website into
compliance with WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. This contractor will share
his/her expertise with current RTD staff tasked with developing new web
content/products to ensure new items are coded in an accessible fashion.
Under the supervision of Marketing’s Digital Team and in conjunction with
IT’s Development Team, this contractor will be tasked with developing a
methodology for remediating the site using Interactive Accessibility’s report
and will create a cheat sheet with code-specific examples for implementing
reusable functionality on www.rtd-denver.com (such as modals, collapsible
content, photo rotators, etc). We require $100,000 to resource an
accessibility expert to complete the items listed in Interactive Accessibility’s
report. Training of RTD staff estimated at $55,000.

(2) Reduction is primarily due to payments made on year-end accrual of expenses
(3) Increase is due to an additional $80 million draw on the FasTracks TIFIA loan
(4) The deficit will be replenished in future months with grant and project fund draws
(5) Increase is due to the FasTracks changes to the Rubber Tire allocation, two months operating costs reserve policy and the delay of the SW Rail relocation costs
(6) Increase is due to the full year budgeted increase to fund balances
(7) The Base System deficit is due to funds being placed in restricted assets for the mid-year debt service payments and will be replenished during the year
