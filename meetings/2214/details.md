#### 1. 2015 - 2020 Strategic Budget Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Motion:                Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, noted that the Directors have received updates on the 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) since March, 2014.  He then introduced Jannette Scarpino, Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis.  She presented the SBP starting on page 85 of the July 8, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring/Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting Packet for approval.  She noted the SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan updated annually.  The attached SBP incorporates the 2014 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best estimates at this time. She pointed out the SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business and reductions, eliminations or deferrals of SBP requested projects.  No service reductions are proposed in the SBP throughout this period.  She also highlighted the revenue and operating expenses estimated for the SBP period.

Director Folska asked if the assumed 10% fare increase for 2016 was for the $2.25 fare.  Jannette Scarpino replied that the assumed fare increase would be across the board.  Director Folska pointed out that RTD is in the process of reviewing the fare structure through a Fare Task Force and asked if it would be reasonable to know if an increase would happen in 2016.  General Manager Phil Washington answered that the Fare Task Force will have results by the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2015 in order to be implemented in 2016.  He also clarified that the Board will engage in a fare analysis every 3 years.  At that time the board can consider an increase, a decrease, or remaining at the same level.  Director Folska pointed out that a 10% fare increase seems insignificant when compared to an almost $500 million operational budget.

Director Lubow asked if fare increases have historically been at 10%. She also asked how a different amount would affect the SBP.  Jannette Scarpino answered that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is typically 2-3% annually.  The 10% figure for a 3 year period is an average.  She added that a different CPI would certainly affect the SBP.  The presented SBP has a positive balance partly due to a fare increase assumption.  She also noted that on every SBP staff works on expenses that can be reduced.  Operating costs are the last expenses to be affected.

Director Bagley confirmed with Jannette Scarpino that the SBP is for the base system and not for any FasTracks components.  Under this distinction, staff doesn’t perceive an increase in ridership affecting the SBP.

Director Solano asked if any study has looked into if lowering the fare rate would lead to an increase in ridership.  Terry Howerter said staff looks at elasticity whenever changes are considered.  He noted this is one of the items the Fare Task Force will look into.  Terry Howerter mentioned that staff used the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) predictions when assuming no growth in ridership.  He added that the last fare increase was in 2011 and that assuming a fare increase every 3 years helped balance the SBP.  Without fare increases it would be hard to keep pace with operating expenses.  Director Solano noted that he had more questions that he would like to think through.

Director Bagley noted that when looking at fare changes it is important to take into consideration fare box revenue.  He mentioned one of the goals of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force from a few years ago was to raise the fare box revenue from 20% to 25%.  RTD is moving toward reaching that objective.  Terry Howerter mentioned that staff needs to report to the Board on this matter.  General Manager Washington added that the Fare Task Force’s work would contribute to the fare box recovery rate, which includes passes and other types of fare media.  He also reminded the Directors to not make any assumptions on the results from Fare Task Force.  Currently RTD is on an unsustainable course with expansions, operations, and people who think the rates should be lower.  At some point, RTD will have to do something.

Director Folska asked why RTD could not get additional revenue from alcohol and tobacco sales taxes.  Sales tax parity and marijuana tax have proven successful.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, noted that RTD does get some cigarette tax as a result of sales tax parity.  Any further taxes would require a vote of the people.

Director Menten mentioned that the original intent of the Fare Task Force was to simplify the system but it sounds like it is evolving into evaluation of fares.  General Manager Washington said the main objective is simplification of fare structure with the possibility of other ideas coming out of the study.

Committee Chair Walker asked staff if any of the deferred projects would lead to a greater expense in the future.  Jannette Scarpino answered that senior staff agreed there are no other repercussions beyond the normal rise in cost due to annual inflation.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

General Manager Washington informed the Directors that he had just received word via text message that President Obama was visiting Denver Union Station (DUS) and The Crawford Hotel.  All RTD operations at DUS have been temporarily suspended.

#### 1. May Monthly Financial Status Report

Terry Howerter introduced Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting, who presented the May Monthly Financial Status Report starting on page 147 of the July 8, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring/Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting Packet.  Overall there was a decrease in Ridership and Fare Revenue but an increase in Sales & Use Tax.  Doug MacLeod pointed out that the monthly report usually compares current numbers to this date’s last year numbers.  The May, 2014 report compares current numbers with the budgeted numbers because that gives a better indication of where RTD is at compared to where we plan to be.

Director Bagley thanked Doug MacLeod for adding the “actual” line item in comparison to the “budgeted” line item on the updated report.
