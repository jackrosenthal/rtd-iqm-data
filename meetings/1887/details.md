### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. APTA Legislative Conference Overview

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, noted that the Directors should have a packet with information for their APTA Legislative Conference trip.  She said that the folder contained fact sheets for both FasTracks and Base System.  She asked that the Directors thoroughly review the overview of events provided.  Sherry Ellebracht pointed out that there is a meeting scheduled for Monday, March 10, 2014, at 11:00 a.m. with Federal Transit Administration’s Acting Administrator Therese McMillan.  She said that the Directors’ briefing with Patton Boggs would be on Monday evening.  Sherry Ellebracht shared that Patton Boggs had already scheduled 14 meetings with an additional 2 or 3 left to schedule.

Chair Sisk highlighted that Charlie Cook would be the speaker for the first General Session on Sunday, March 9, 2014 at 5:00 p.m.  He shared that he has heard Mr. Cook speak on several occasions; Chair Sisk thinks that Mr. Cook is really wonderful to hear.  Chair Sisk also noted that while there are no formal dinners, there are evening meetings that have been scheduled.  The Directors have the Patton Boggs briefing on Monday and then a Public-Private Partnership (P3)/Finance meeting with George Mason University staff.

#### 2. Local Update

Sherry Ellebracht stated that Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, was unable to attend the meeting due to being sick but provided her with an update.  She said that the Metro Area Commissioners meeting would be on March 7, 2014 but Roger Sherman did not believe there were any agenda items that would affect RTD.  She said that the next Metro Mayors Caucus meeting would be April 2, 2014.

Sherry Ellebracht shared that the Colorado Transportation Coalition has decided not to release any additional analysis about the MPACT64 polling.  She explained that they would release an executive summary but would not be doing a lot of the cross tabs that had been discussed.

Sherry Ellebracht said that Roger Sherman had been coordinating with the Denver Union Station grand opening committee.  He has reached out to each jurisdiction about attending the May 8, 2014 Gala.

Sherry Ellebracht noted that the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) two-on-one meetings with Directors have been going very well.  She said that Roger Sherman thanks the Directors for being so responsive.

#### 3. State Update

Sherry Ellebracht explained that at the State level there will be a construction defects bill presented within the next few weeks.  She said that Brandeberry~McKenna will pass the bill on to the Board once it is available.

Chair Sisk commented that there has been some discussion about late bills being presented to the legislature.  He wanted to make the Board aware that Senator Jones may bring a late bill related to P3s that would have a potential impact for how CDOT does P3s but may impact the way RTD does them  as well.

#### 4. Federal Update

Sherry Ellebracht shared that Mike Dino of Patton Boggs was in Washington, D.C. already so he was not able to attend the meeting.  She informed the Board that RTD was just notified that we would be receiving $150 million for Fiscal Year 2014 (FY14) appropriations for our Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA).  She explained that RTD asked for $160 million to make up for shortfalls from previous years; however, RTD received the full $150 million we were programmed to get in FY14 and staff is thrilled.
