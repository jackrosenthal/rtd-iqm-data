BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
2021-2026 Strategic Plan Implementation Update

Committee Meeting Date:
June 1, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
25 minutes
BACKGROUND
A strategic plan provides an organization with a north star and is a means to align resources and
activities to outcomes. The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Plan) is RTD’s north star and provides the
overarching framework for decision-making at every level. The Plan also represents a fundamental shift:
reframing the value of transit in terms of outcomes, not simply inputs. While the traditional metrics of
ridership and on-time performance are important, transit brings greater value to the community, even to
those who are not customers.
The Board adopted the Plan on August 10, 2021. Prior to its adoption:
The Board held a work session in April 2021 and a retreat in June 2021 to gain consensus on the
Strategic Plan framework
The Board held a Strategic Plan workshop on May 5, 2021
The GMOC finalized the General Manager and CEO’s compensation framework, philosophy and
structure on July 8, 2021
The Plan articulates:
Mission: We make lives better through connections
Vision: To be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to our customers and
community
Values: Passion, Respect, Diversity, Trustworthiness, Collaboration and Ownership
Strategic Priorities: Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and Financial
Success
In addition, the Plan elements can be viewed in four areas:
1. Why: the mission, vision and values
2. What: the measurable strategic outcomes
3. How: the work plan, milestones and budget
4. Who: the performance metrics and monitoring thereof
The Board is responsible for the Why and the What, which provide clarity in mission, vision and
outcomes. The General Manager and CEO, along with agency staff, is responsible for the How and the
Who, enabling progress on outcomes.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1.1

Subsequent to the adoption of the Plan, the Board adopted committee restructuring and established the
Performance Committee on October 26, 2021.
DISCUSSION
On February 17, 2022 the Performance Committee received a presentation on the results of the
Customer Excellence survey (conducted in October 2021) and the Community Value survey (conducted
in November 2021) and reported the net promoter score for the related strategic priorities.
Currently, staff is focused on the How and the What, taking actionable steps to move the needle on the
strategic priorities, which efforts include but are not limited to:
Creation of a metrics tracking workbook, populated with baseline and year-to-date data
Engagement sessions throughout the agency with all levels of staff to educate and strategize
Identification of needed resources and deployment of collaborative delivery teams
Focusing on areas of opportunity derived from Customer Excellence and Community Value survey
results
Alignment of internal resources to deliver on Employee Ownership and Financial Success
Further aligning the Plan to serve as the umbrella for other high-level initiatives
Moving forward together, through the end of 2022, collaboration with the Board will focus on:
The mission, vision and outcomes, thereby highlighting the Why and the What
Reviewing progress on the How and the Who through reports on metrics and success outcomes
Reviewing the second wave of Customer Excellence and Community Value surveys (surveys) to
be conducted in the fall of 2022
Receiving updates on:
Employee engagement opportunities
Areas of opportunity identified in the first wave of surveys conducted in the fall of 2021
The success of the Plan requires continued collaboration and agility. It is important to remember that,
even though the Plan is far-reaching and structured, it must be able to account for the dynamic
environment in which it exists. With the Board focused on the What and Why, and staff focused on the
How and Who, the needle will continue to move in the right direction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The establishment of baseline performance will not result in any direct financial impact at this time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
GM/CEO Employment Agreement Review Discussion

Committee Meeting Date:
June 1, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson entered into an employment agreement,
dated September 29, 2020 (Agreement), which provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms.
Johnson, will adopt a program by which the Board will annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance.
The evaluation must be based upon goals and metrics established by the Board in consultation with Ms.
Johnson that are directly attributable to her performance. Incentive awards and annual increases to Ms.
Johnson’s base salary are subject to the Board’s evaluation and Ms. Johnson meeting or exceeding the
performance goals.
DISCUSSION
On July 20, 2021, the Board and Ms. Johnson executed a Third Amendment to the Agreement to
establish the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation program for Ms. Johnson.
Pursuant to that amendment, Ms. Johnson may submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board prior to the
issuance of any final performance appraisal. For the performance period of November 9, 2020 through
November 8, 2021, the Board evaluated Ms. Johnson based upon the criteria set forth in the Job
Description approved by the Board in connection with the 2020 GM/CEO recruitment. For performance
periods beginning January 1, 2022, the annual performance appraisal score will be comprised of 50%
objective Success Outcomes and 50% subjective Organizational Values as adopted by the Board
pursuant to the Strategic Plan. For performance periods beginning January 1, 2023, Ms. Johnson is
eligible for a compensation increase of 15% of the Adjusted Base Salary, of which the distribution
between base and incentive compensation may be adjusted by the Board annually. If RTD exceeds the
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes and Goals by 25%, Ms. Johnson receives an additional 2% OverPerformance Goal incentive payment. If the Board does not provide an evaluation to Ms. Johnson by
December 31 in any year, Ms. Johnson will be deemed to have met all performance expectations for
that performance period.
The amendment also provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a
compensation and benchmarking analysis of the GM/CEO position. This analysis will be used to set Ms.
Johnson’s Adjusted Base Salary and Incentive Compensation One-Time Payment for performance
periods beginning January 1, 2023.
