### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Civil Rights ADA Program Update

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, shared with the Board that the handout in the February 11, 2014 Civil Rights Committee Meeting Agenda Packet summarizes the activities of the Civil Rights Division as it relates to their newest initiative, the ADA Program.  He noted that there were a number of elements associated with the program.  The first goal was to re-engage the community through the Americans with Disabilities Act Advisory Committee (ADAAC) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Committee.  He explained that ADAAC committee is the external committee that meets with Civil Rights staff to discuss their community’s concerns; the ADA Committee is the internal committee that works to resolve the ADAAC’s concerns.

Kenn Hardin stated that as part of the ADA Program, his team wanted to focus on creating milestones to begin implementing key areas of the program.  He said that there were three core areas they would be focusing on: communication, compliance and training.  Kenn Hardin asked the Board for their opinions and suggestions to help develop this program.

Director Tobiassen feels it is very exciting to see RTD coming up to speed and recognizing people with disabilities.  He appreciates staff’s hard work.  Director Tobiassen wondered if staff was reaching out to people with disabilities within RTD to participate in the ADA Committee.  Kenn Hardin stated that they were.

Director Tobiassen commented that one of the things previously discussed was making RTD a better place for people with disabilities to find meaningful employment.  He recognizes that it has been a struggle because of the rapid development of technology; however, he believes that as a large organization we should be able to influence our software and hardware vendors to make sure they are providing solutions that RTD can make adaptable for people with disabilities.  He hopes the ADA program can include meaningful employment as part of the milestones.  Kenn Hardin shared that Director Folska was instrumental in recommending two individuals for staff to work with in regards to employment; one focuses on working with Veterans and the other works with employer adaptability for people with disabilities.

Director Folska believes this work is outstanding.  She is excited to follow the progress in this area.  Director Folska asked if there were any plans to hire a dedicated individual as the ADA Coordinator for the agency.  She believes this position will be very helpful in order to ensure success in this program.  She noted that other agencies and organizations often have an ADA Coordinator so it is a very common practice.  Director Folska also thinks the ADA Coordinator would be very instrumental in making sure any software purchased was fully accessible.  Kenn Hardin said that this is something he is working on with General Manager Washington which he will continue to do.

Director Solano expressed his concern for the Hispanic community, especially the disabled Spanish speaking individuals.  He wonders if we will be able to effectively communicate with them.  Kenn Hardin noted that Limited English Proficiency (LEP) falls under Title VI; however, anyone with a disability will be worked with through the ADA Program.  He shared that the Civil Rights Division has many people within the department who speak Spanish.

Director Deadwyler thanked Kenn Hardin for his work.  She believes this program is wonderful.  Director Deadwyler noted that people have more respect for what RTD is doing if we start from the inside.  She shared that the handicap entrance to the Blake facility is really a hindrance.  There is only one entrance that goes around a corner and is extremely cluttered with desks and other items.  She recognizes that people work in that area but believes it should be made more safe and inviting for people with disabilities.  Director Deadwyler said that this really needs to be addressed around the corner where mirrors are needed to avoid collisions.  She asked if there were any plans to make our building more accessible and inviting.  General Manager Washington said that the facilities managers would look at the area.  He agreed that it is cluttered.  General Manager Washington recognized that one of the challenges that RTD has is that we have outgrown the Blake building.

##### a. ADA Update

### D. Other Matters

Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede passed out some information related to the recent article in the Denver Post about 9to5 Colorado’s transit service report that is available for review in the RTD Board Office.  She asked the Board to review the information and come back to staff with any questions.

Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede shared that RTD received a special award on February 5, 2014.  She said that we were recognized by the Diversity Recruiters Network with the Diversity Spirit Achievement Award for our active support of diversity in the workplace.  She congratulated the entire RTD family.
