BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Employee Survey

June 2, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
Ben Celius, Senior Performance Analyst
Jake Stoudenmire, Manager, Market Research
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board on August 10, 2021. The
Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance.
To assess the agency’s progress regarding the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership, annual
employee surveys are conducted to discern employees’ opinions, perceptions, and attitudes and to gain
a deeper understanding of employee perspectives and focus areas for improvement. The first employee
survey developed to garner information regarding the Strategic Plan metrics was conducted in 2022.
DISCUSSION
In keeping with the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership, during the Performance Committee
meeting scheduled for Monday, June 2, 2025, staff will present information related to the responses to
the 2025 Employee Ownership survey.
The 2025 employee survey was held over a four-week period, from April 15 through May 16, to
coincide with frontline represented employees’ work shift selection related to the May 2025 service
change. To encourage participation, in-person events were held at several operating and maintenance
facilities. Employees were able to complete the survey at events using a tablet or a printed survey or
online via the Qualtrics survey platform. Printed copies of the survey were also available at all operating
and maintenance facilities for the duration of the survey period.
The survey included questions related to employees’ jobs, employees’ likelihood of recommending RTD
as a place of employment, and satisfaction with a variety of factors ranging from internal services,
management, supervision, Strategic Plan alignment, and career development.
In total, 1,014 out of 3,114 total eligible employees (32%) submitted survey responses, a slight decline
in participation year over year.

1.C.1

Employee Net Promoter Score
One indicator used to gauge employee satisfaction is the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS). Net
Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric that is commonly used to measure customer satisfaction in the private
sector. From that model, eNPS has been adapted to gauge employee satisfaction using responses on a
scale from 0-10 to the question, “How likely are you to recommend working at RTD to friends or family
members?” Those responding 0-6 are considered detractors, 7-8 are passives, and 9-10 are promoters.
The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters resulting in the eNPS,
measured on a scale of -100 to 100. The eNPS for 2024 is 4, which is six points higher than the 2024
result.
Staff recognizes the limitations of eNPS in assessing overall employee satisfaction, especially in relation
to the specificity of the question and unique circumstances surrounding recommending particular
employment opportunities to friends and family.
Composite Index Score
A second high-level indicator was introduced in 2023 to provide a more complete representation of
overall employee satisfaction and engagement. The Employee Ownership composite index score (index
score) is a metric developed to gauge responses to a series of survey prompts to assess factors
associated with employee sentiment regarding their work environment overall. The index score
represents an average of the “agree” and “strongly agree” responses to six survey prompts related to
employees’ feelings of engagement, support, and safety:
•
•
•
•
•
•

I understand how my performance is linked to the success of the organization
I feel physically safe in my work environment from equipment-related failures, injuries or other
workplace hazards
My supervisor is invested in my growth and success
I feel comfortable taking risks, expressing ideas and concerns, speaking up with questions and
admitting mistakes
I have the resources to successfully perform my duties
I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment

The agency-wide composite index score for 2025 is 78%, as compared to 74% in 2024 and 62% in
2023, indicating that efforts deployed to enhance the overall employee experience are yielding positive
effects.
Positive/Negative Response Prompts
Included in the survey were 17 prompts designed to measure employee sentiment regarding a variety of
measures. The prompts were worded in the affirmative, and a favorable response to a given prompt is
considered as “agree” or “strongly agree” for assessment purposes.
Average responses to 16 of the 17 prompts improved in 2025 as compared to 2024, which in turn
improved over 2023. The single prompt with declining favorability dipped 1%, within the margin of error

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

for this year’s survey. The overall increase in response favorability indicates general job satisfaction and
employee engagement, which sentiment is somewhat at odds with the eNPS for 2025 of 4. As such,
continued discussion is warranted regarding the use of eNPS as the appropriate gauge to measure
success in relation to the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership.
Comparing year-over-year responses:
•

The response with the highest favorability among employees, both in 2024 and in 2025, was to
the statement, “My supervisor treats me with respect.” Among all employees, 90% agreed or
strongly agreed with this statement, an increase of 2% over 2024

•

The largest year-over-year improvements in 2025 were with respect to responses to the
statements:
o “I have trust in my departmental manager(s) to make decisions that align with the values
of the organization,” an 8% increase (79%)
o “I have the resources to successfully perform my duties,” a 7% increase to 77%

•

Over a two-year period, favorable responses to each of the 17 survey prompts increased, with an
average overall increase of 15%

•

Responses to the statement “I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment,” the
response with the lowest overall favorability in the 2023 survey, continued to increase, from
45% of employees who agreed or strongly agreed that they felt safe in the work environment in
2023, to 66% in 2024 and 70% in 2025, a 25% increase in only two years
o This dramatic improvement indicates that efforts related to the Welcoming Transit
Environment Strategic Initiative are having a significant positive impact

•

Responses to several other survey prompts have increased significantly over the same two-year
period:
o I am adequately informed about agency news, projects, and initiatives (20% increase)
o I am provided support and opportunities for professional development (19%)
o I feel physically safe in my work environment from equipment-related failures, injuries, or
other workplace-based safety hazards (18%)
o I have trust in my direct supervisor(s) to make decisions that align with the values of the
organization (18%)
o I am provided the tools I need to grow my career (17%)
o I understand how my role connects to the agency’s mission and vision (16%)
o I have trust in my departmental manager(s) to make decisions that align with the values of
the organization (16%)
o I have the resources to successfully perform my duties (15%)
o I feel my perspective is invited and valued, even if it differs from that of my supervisor or
leadership (15%)

Responses Related to Strategic Initiatives
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff has held recurring strategy sessions designed to assess and improve agency performance
through the development of specific tactics. These tactics were distilled into overarching Strategic
Initiatives: Back to Basics, People Power, Welcoming Transit Environment, and Customer and
Community Connections. For the performance period commencing July 1, 2024, and concluding June
30, 2025, non-represented employees whose job descriptions include managerial duties were required to
develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals, developed using the SMART framework and based on the
Strategic Initiatives, as an element of their annual performance plan.
Responses to certain survey questions highlight the efficacy of the Strategic Initiatives in improving
success outcomes, as depicted in the presentation that accompanies this report.
Key Takeaways
In analyzing the response data, staff has identified key takeaways:
• Favorable responses to survey prompts increased year over year in 2025, building upon strong
gains seen in 2024
• Efforts to improve upon areas of lower favorability are yielding success; over a two-year period,
favorable responses to 17 survey prompts increased by 15% on average
• Curve of favorability by tenure seen in 2024 flattened in 2025
• Given the continued favorability of survey responses, and given that eNPS has increased only
modestly over the same time period, further discussion is warranted to determine whether eNPS
is an accurate measurement of employee satisfaction
• An analysis of key drivers highlights areas of opportunity to further enhance Employee Ownership
Next Steps
The results of the employee survey continue to inform individual employee contributions throughout the
agency in support of the Strategic Initiatives – Back to Basics, People Power, Welcoming Transit
Environment, and Customer and Community Connections – which stem from the agency’s four Strategic
Priorities. Staff will continue to assess the survey responses to further refine and develop Strategic
Initiatives in furtherance of the Strategic Plan.
