RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the recalculated base rental
schedule related to the partial refinancing of the 2010 leased property.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued its Series 2010A and 2010B certificates of participation (COPs) to finance the
2010 Improvement Project which included 55 new Siemens light rail vehicles, 95 access-a-Ride vehicles,
32 Call-n-Ride vehicles, fare boxes and CAD/AVL equipment. The 2010A and 2010B COPs also
refinanced the 1998A and 2001A COPs for interest expense savings. In November 2019, RTD entered
a forward delivery agreement to deliver COPs in March 2020 to refund the 2010A COPs that will save
the district a gross amount of approximately $19 million between 2020 and 2026.
DISCUSSION
The recommended resolution authorizes the recalculated principal and interest payments related to the
2010 Improvement Project to reflect the lower cost of interest achieved through the 2019 forward
delivery agreement. This authorization is a requirement to close the refunding transaction which is
currently scheduled to close on March 3, 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Upon closing of the related refunding transaction, RTD will recognize a net present value savings of
approximately $17 million or 22% which is well above the RTD Fiscal Policy requirement of 3%
minimum savings. This majority of this interest expense savings will be realized between the years
2020 and 2026.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the
recalculated base rental schedule related to the partial refinancing of the 2010 leased property.
2. Modify the recommended resolution.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $6.910 million from the FasTracks Operating Reserve to the
North Metro Operations Standup budget, to allow for the carryforward of standup expense funds
that were budgeted but not spent in 2019. The funds to be transferred will be allocated to the
standup budget as follows:

The Operating Reserve will be replenished in the 2020 Amended Budget with the funds that were
not spent on North Metro standup expense in 2019.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #5 – Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
In October 2017, through the adoption of the 2017 Annual Program Evaluation, the RTD Board
authorized the expenditure of $19.9 million in capital funds and $12.8 million in expense funds for
mobilization for corridor operations for the N Line. These funds were appropriated in full in the 2018
and 2019 Adopted Budgets.
In October 2019, $1.516 million of the expense funding was transferred to capital to account for
consumables and spare parts that originally were programmed as expense items, bu t were
determined to be capital expenditures.
In December 2019, with the adoption of the 2020 Adopted Budget, all unspent capital funds in the
North Metro Operations Standup capital project, including the $1.516 million transferred in 2019,

were carried forward into 2020.
carried forward into 2020.

However, only $657,000 of the unspent expense funds were

DISCUSSION
As of January 2, 2020, RTD had spent a total of $13.5 million of the total North Metro standup
budget of $32.7 million, and had outstanding commitments for an additional $7.9 million of costs to
be incurred in 2020. The table below shows the budget status, broken out between capital and
expense, in millions of dollars.

The 2020 Adopted Budget includes capital carryforward funding to cover all the outstanding capital
commitments and any identified future capital costs that have not been committed to date.
However, due to delays in delivering items that were anticipated to be received and paid for in 2019,
the carryforward request included in the expense budget was not sufficient to cover all t he items
that were not received in 2019. In addition to these items not received in 2019, staff has identified
an additional $1.4 million in expense items that will be required to open the N line for revenue
service in 2020, which can be funded within the standup budget originally approved by the Board in
October 2017. Major items remaining to be delivered in 2020 include:
 Spare parts, equipment, and tools for maintenance and operational support
 Contractor services for operator training
 Contractor services for train dispatching
 Contractor services for maintenance training
 Contractor services for staff augmentation until RTD reaches full headcount for ongoing
operations
 Software for train control and dispatching
 Janitorial and maintenance services for commuter rail facilities
All of these items are needed to open the N line for revenue service on schedule, and are estimated
to cost $4.7 million.
This action also would take the $2.9 million in expense funding that was not spent in 2019, and
was not identified as needed to meet outstanding commitments or planned expenditures, and
reallocate this funding to the maintenance of way building construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. Funding for North Metro Operations standup was
included in the 2019 Amended Budget in specific expense line items. The savings to RTD from not
expending the funds in 2019 will be carried forward into 2020 and used to replenish the FasTracks
Operating Reserve at the time of the 2020 Amended Budget.

were not spent on North Metro standup expense in 2019.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer. This
action is not recommended because RTD still has outstanding commitments for $3.3 million
of expenses attributable to North Metro operations standup, and an additional $1.4 million
that will be needed in 2020 before the line opens for revenue service. If this transfer is not
approved, these amounts will need to be covered from the 2020 operations budget for the
corridor, which will not leave sufficient funding to operate the service for the remainder of
2020.

Approval of Contract Authority for TCS for
Training North Metro Operators

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with
Transportation Certification Services (TCS) for operator training and train dispatch services to increase
the contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,208,000 for a total not-to-exceed contract amount of
$1,840,125. Funding for 2020 work orders to be issued under this contract will be provided through a
budget transfer to carry forward unspent 2019 expense funding.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #5 – Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
In 2017 the RTD board directed staff to take the actions necessary to op erate the N Line, which was
under construction at the time, with in-house staff. This included hiring and training staff to operate
all functions of the line.
In May 2019, RTD awarded a contract to TCS to perform operator training for the N Line. The sole
source contract was awarded for one year, and a contract amount not-to-exceed amount of
$142,125. RTD increased the hours of training for an additional $490,000 for a total not to exceed
$632,125.
RTD also was required to provide dispatching services for the commissioning and testing of the line
prior to training and revenue operations. This function was provided through a contract with HNTB,
which provides systems services for North Metro construction, and it was funded through the North
Metro construction project.
As of the end of 2019, RTD is in the final phases of the construction and hand off from the
construction contractors and in the final steps of hiring and training operational staff.
DISCUSSION
The contract extension for TCS is expected to cover two critical areas of need to open the N Line for
revenue service: operator training and train dispatching.
This contract addresses two main issues associated with training operators for revenue service; the
need to certify all of the N Line operators to operate the trains, and the need to create, document,
and implement the ongoing training processes to meet the Federal Rail Administration’s (FRA)
requirements.

1.B.3

As of the end of 2019, operator training classes are still being conducted by TCS. It is projected
that, by the end of April, the new permanent RTD trainer will be on board and the initial training will
be almost concluded. This action would extend the contract through April 2020 and add an
additional $600,000 for continued operator training to allow TCS to continue training operators until
RTD is able to hire an in-house trainer.
In addition, since the construction phase is concluding and the line is transitioning to operating, the
function of dispatching trains must transition also from a construction mode to an operation mode.
The RTD Commuter Rail Dispatcher positions will be posted in January 2020. It is anticipated that
the positions will be filled by the end of February 2020, with training of the RTD Commuter Rail
Dispatchers completed by the end of March 2020. This action would allow TCS to provide RTD with
dispatching services until the RTD dispatchers are hired and trained, so that operators would be able
to complete in-rail-car operation training, and it would add $608,000 to pay for the dispatchers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract will be provided from the North Metro standup operations budget, through a
budget transfer to carry forward unspent 2019 expense funding.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to amend the contract with Transportation Certification Services for
operator training and train dispatch services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by
$1,208,000 for a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $1,840,125. Funding for 2020 work
orders to be issued under this contract will be provided through a budget transfer to carry
forward unspent 2019 expense funding.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the recommended increase to the
contract for TCS. Instead, wait until the new RTD trainer and dispatchers are hired, and use
those staff to perform operator training.
In this case, the trainer would need to develop all
training materials before conducting in class training and in-rail-car operation training, and the inrail-car training could not start until the new dispatchers were hired. This would result in a
significant delay in implementing operator training, which could delay the opening of the N Line
for revenue service.

Re:

2018 County Allocations

Attached is a summary and detail estimation of the RTD funding sources and uses by
county for 2018. We have created this information in response to a request from a
member of the Colorado Legislature. We do not regularly report financial information in
this manner because it requires many assumptions and can easily be misinterpreted
without taking into account the underlying methodology as well as the interdependencies
of a regional transit system. While the total information is accurate and agrees with the
audited 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the breakdowns by county would
not be auditable due to the significant estimates made in performing the allocations.
In reviewing this financial information, it is important to consider the following:

D

1) Funding sources and uses by county are provided and consumed by residents of
many counties. For example, sales tax revenues generated by a car dealership or
mall in a specific county are paid, in part, by customers visiting from other
counties. Likewise, a transit customer purchasing a fare in one county often
travels through several counties in consuming operating expenses.
2) The 2018 information presented is a snapshot in time and the results by county
can and do shift dramatically by year due to service changes, openings and capital
expenditures.
3) RTD’s hub and spoke geographic model has its primary service hubs in Denver
County at Denver Union Station where most service concentrates. This results in
a larger share of expenditures being attributed to Denver County.
4) It is important to note that all counties have significant operating losses which
compares fares and other operating revenues to the cost of service provided. In
other words, each county is heavily subsidized by sales taxes and federal grants.

In preparing this information, we made certain assumptions on the breakdown of
revenues and costs by county. Those assumptions are summarized below:
1) Fare revenues by county are allocated based on average weekday boardings and
alightings on each route in the county where the stop is located.
2) Operating costs by county are allocated based on in-service hours operated on
each route in each county.
3) Sales and use tax are allocated based on collections by county as reported by the
Colorado Department of Revenue.

1.C.1.b

1.C.1.b

4) Federal formula grants are allocated based on the cost incurred in the counties
located in the urbanized areas for which the grants are appropriated.
5) Costs and revenues for which we could not obtain detail by county were not
allocated, but were summarized. These costs include access-a-Cab, vanpool,
FasTracks project expense for projects under construction, and interest expense.
6) Revenues for which we could not obtain detail by county were not allocated, but
were summarized. These revenues include advertising, parking, naming rights,
non-formula operating grants, investment income, lease and rental income, gain
or loss on capital assets, and miscellaneous revenues.

NOTES:
1. Revenues allocated by county include sales and use tax, farebox revenue, formula operating grants, service buyups, City and County of Denver contribution to the maintenance of the Sixteenth
Street Mall. Revenues not allocated by county include advertising, parking, naming rights, non-formula operating grants, investment income, lease and rental income, gain or loss on capital
assets, and miscellaneous revenues.
2. Operating and maintenance costs are a one-year snapshot of costs, and vary year-by-year based on the timing of FasTracks corridor openings and service changes.
3. Operating and maintenance costs include depreciation on assets already in service.
4. Costs not allocated by county include access-a-Cab, vanpool, FasTracks project expense for projects under construction, and interest expense.
5. Net subsidy equals total revenues minus total costs. A positive net subsidy means that revenues collected are greater than total costs. A negative net subsidy means that costs exceed
revenues.

DISCUSSION
Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper-based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card onto which customers load
and reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood
EcoPass and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass, and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 315,176 active cards in circulation. Between January –
December 2019, 12.85 million taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016, MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. The cash value can be loaded onto the card online, at
RTD sales outlets and at retail outlets (Safeway and King Soopers). On May 24, 2017, the MyRide web
portal was launched to the public. As of December 2019, approximately 51,313 cards were issued, of
which 36,950 (77%) were full fare cards, 11,030 (23%) were discounted cards, 3,070 (8%) were
youth cards, and 260 (1%) were LiVE cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and
reloads) was $39.51, with a total value loaded of $9,201,600. There were nearly 2,854,300 trips taken
using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $8,041,500. Of these trips: 78% were local,
19% regional and 3% airport. Safeway and King Soopers began loading cash value onto MyRide cards
on June 1, 2017, and July 1, 2017, respectively. Safeway has loaded $199,900 in cash value and King
Soopers has loaded $285,850 since launch.
RTD and Conduent have reached final system acceptance on the Smart Media Technology base
contract. No major enhancements are planned for the Smart Media Technology system. Negotiations
for the Smart Media Technology hardware maintenance and software support contract is expected to
conclude by Q1 2020. Conduent will continue to replace burned-out platform validator screens for as
long as the Smart Media Technology System is in operation.
Mobile Ticketing
RTD has three mobile app sales channels which allow customers to purchase fare products for bus and
rail; the RTD branded app (launched Nov 2017), Uber app (launched May 2019) and Transit app
(launched Sept 2019). Full fare, senior, individual with disabilities discount, and youth discount 3-hour
pass, day pass, and monthly passes, as well as, LiVE discount 3-hour and day passes are sold in all
three mobile app sales channels. All mobile tickets sold in the Uber app and Transit app cost the same as
they do in the RTD branded mobile app.

Packet Pg. 55

1.C.4

As of December 2019, 14.2% of fare revenue is from the mobile ticketing sales channel (all 3 apps
combined). Since inception, RTD has sold 4,119,059 tickets in the RTD branded app, 37,289 tickets in
the Uber app and 12,628 tickets in the Transit app for a total of 4,168,976 mobile tickets valued at
$25,508,198. This represents a month-over-month growth in 2019 of 6.4% for the mobile ticketing
sales channel.
New Account-Based Fare Collection
Electronic Fare Operations resources and efforts are focused on launching the new Account-Based Fare
Collection System. The $3.8M grant received from DRCOG, in 2019, will be used to purchase
validators in a competitive procurement. The new Account-Based Fare Collection System will consist of
turning on the Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) feature on the existing Masabi mobile ticketing platform
and connecting the new validators to the Masabi mobile ticketing platform. The Account-Based
Ticketing feature allows smart cards and other media (such as a student id or a contactless bank card)
to be used as fare media. Implementation will be conducted in a phased approach.

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: January 14, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
Staff has presented a monthly update to the Board on the LiVE Program since its July 2019
implementation but will change to quarterly updates in 2020 since LiVE is no longer new and has
stabilized in month-to-month activity.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 57

1.C.5

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of December 5, 2020, 4,609 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 2,767 have been
approved, 1,285 have been denied and the remaining 557 are pending. Of the 1,285 denied, 878 were
denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better
discount. 296 were denied because their address was out of District, 10 were denied because it was a
duplicate application, 7 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 7 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 87 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold. Of the 557 pending applications, 527 lack an uploaded photo, 21 are
pending for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for
LiVE, and 9 are pending for income verification by Denver Human Services.

In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:





LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.

Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing. One of the items the team is exploring is the
possibility of a temporary LiVE ID card to bridge the time gap between application approval
and the customer’s ability to use the discount.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application worker helping interested individuals apply at rotating
locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. We have started
discussions with Denver Human Services about providing such a service.

On-Going:





RTD is working closely with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to
work out remaining “bugs”.
RTD staff is pursuing targeted outreach opportunities and is also including LiVE
information and brochures in other RTD outreach activities.
Denver Human Services is providing information and training about LiVE applications to
county and community partners.
RTD is continuing to communicate with nonprofit agencies to support a smooth transition
from the current nonprofit program rules procedures to the new ones that go into effect in
2020.

Next Steps:






RTD will kick off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE.
Define the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing in
PEAK.
Work with Denver Human Services to define how application help at rotating locations
could best be achieved and negotiate an agreement.
RTD will conduct a survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
