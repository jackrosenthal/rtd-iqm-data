BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy

September 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Compensation
Philosophy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the February 15, 2023, Performance Committee (committee) meeting, committee members
reached a consensus that the processes for evaluating both the performance of the GM/CEO and of the
agency itself (evaluation processes) could be enhanced.
The committee members reviewed the following materials during the April 12, 2023, meeting:
• The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan adopted by the Board of Directors on August 10, 2021
• The GM/CEO Employment Agreement (contract) entered into on September 29, 2020, and most
recently amended in the Fourth Amendment agreed to on October 26, 2022
• The Compensation Study Report completed by Gallagher dated November 18, 2022
Further, committee members agreed to explore possible strategies and opportunities to enhance the
evaluation processes.
On June 5, 2023, the Chief People Officer delivered a compensation philosophy presentation, from an
objective human resources perspective, detailing the considerations, factors, types, and components to
be considered in developing said philosophy.
On June 26, 2023, the committee convened an executive session for consideration of the
compensation, performance appraisal, and employment agreement for the current GM/CEO, to receive
legal advice, as well as to hear from the current GM/CEO, regarding these topics.
On July 17, 2023, the committee convened for subsequent consideration of a draft compensation
philosophy. After fulsome dialogue and consideration, the committee asked that the draft compensation
philosophy be circulated to the full Board for further input, edits, and consideration.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Suggested edits have since been incorporated into the draft compensation philosophy. It was agreed
that the amended compensation philosophy would return to the committee for review and
recommendation to the full Board at the September 2023 monthly Board meeting.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the Board will honor its commitment to establish a compensation
philosophy for the GM/CEO as noted in the 2010 State Audit on Executive Compensation Practices.
A compensation philosophy is a foundational document from which the Board can establish a base salary
compensation range for the GM/CEO position. Further, effective January 1, 2021, the Colorado Equal
Pay for Equal Work Act requires employers with one or more employees to include the rate of
compensation or a compensation range; a general description of bonuses, commissions, or other
compensation; and a general description of all employment benefits offered for the position, including
healthcare benefits, retirement benefits, paid time off, and any tax reportable benefits when posting a
position. Therefore, the agency has defined a salary range for every other position within the agency,
except the GM/CEO position.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of this recommended action.
Regardless of the base salary compensation range established for the GM/CEO’s position, the total
compensation of any seated GM/CEO is negotiable and must be agreed to by both the Board and
GM/CEO.

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO (draft as of 8/31/2023)

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi-modal transit agency.
The overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment and tight labor market.
Therefore, RTD must be market competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private
sectors when considering talent acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay-for-performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay-for-performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.
Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Performance Appraisal Process and Timeline

September 11, 2023

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Director Erik Davidson, Chair, Performance Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Conducting the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) performance appraisal is a fundamental
responsibility of the Board of Directors. An annual appraisal must be completed per the Board’s Bylaws
and the current employment agreement with the GM/CEO, which was entered into on September 29,
2020, and most recently amended via the Fourth Amendment on October 26, 2022 (GM/CEO
Agreement). The Bylaws provide that the Chair and the Performance Committee are responsible for the
annual appraisal. (Article VI, Section 1 (f) and Article VII, Section 5)
As relevant to the appraisal process and timing, the GM/CEO Agreement provides:
•
•

•

•

The GM/CEO has the opportunity to submit a self-assessment for the Board’s consideration prior
to issuance of a final appraisal
On November 1 each year, the GM/CEO can propose any suggested adjustments to the Weighted
Success Outcomes, Organizational Values or Goals, and the proposed distribution between base
salary and incentive compensation (Appraisal Criteria and Weighting) for the following year’s
performance period for the Board’s consideration
By December 31 of each year, the Board will provide an appraisal to the GM/CEO; should the
Board fail to do so, the GM/CEO will be deemed to have met all performance expectations for
that performance period
By December 31 of each year, after consideration of and consultation with the GM/CEO regarding
recommended adjustments, the Board shall adopt the Appraisal Criteria and Weighting for the
following year’s performance period; should the Board fail to do so, the GM/CEO will be assessed
and compensated based on the Appraisal Criteria and Weighting for the prior performance period

On December 6, 2022, the Board adopted the GM/CEO Performance Appraisal Criteria and Weighting for
the performance period commencing January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2023, and for each
performance period thereafter, with 50% of the performance appraisal score for the Board-adopted
objective Strategic Priorities (Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and
Financial Success), with equal weight being given to each, and 50% for the subjective Organizational
Values (Passion, Respect, Diversity, Trustworthiness, Collaboration, and Ownership).

1.D.1

During the July 17, 2023, Performance Committee meeting, the committee members concurred that the
Chair of the Performance Committee and the Board Office would work, in consultation with the GM/CEO
and Chief People Officer, to further develop the calendar of events and processes associated with the
2023 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal.
DISCUSSION
There are two primary objectives for the Performance Committee’s discussion during the Monday,
September 11, 2023, meeting:
1. Review the proposed calendar of events and processes associated with the 2023 GM/CEO
Performance Appraisal
2. Discuss and reach consensus on the 2024 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal process and timeline
Following the discussion, the Board Office will work with the GM/CEO to calendar key activities in the
2023 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal process and begin work to develop the necessary documents for
the completion of the 2023 GM/CEO Performance Appraisal.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the GM/CEO’s performance is reflective of the overall performance
of the agency as a whole.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with this recommended action.
