PEGGY CATLIN: John McKay. And we have Melanie Snyder. So am I missing anyone?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. You're missing Director Menten.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Menten, are you on the line? I don't believe she's joined yet.
[COMPUTER TONE]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I heard somebody just join. Would folks kindly mute their phones and their
microphones so-- thank you.
So Committee members that are on the phone are Directors Walker, Director Lewis, myself, and
then Director Rivera-Malpiede and alternate Vince Buzek. So I believe we do have a quorum.
Oh, Ms. McManus has also joined.
I'd like to call the meeting to order, the General Manager Executive Search/ General Manager
Oversight Committee meeting, at 2:04 on September 9, 2020.
At this point, I'd like to entertain a motion to go into executive session pursuant to 24-6402(4)(f)(l) Colorado Revised Statute for consideration of personnel matters regarding General
Manager/Chief Executive Officer, [COMPUTER NOISE] 402(4)(e)(l) Colorado Revised Statute
for determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations, developing
strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiators regarding General Manager/ Chief
Executive Officer compensation and contract, and 24-6-402(4)(b) Colorado Revised Statute to
receive legal advice regarding the same. Do I hear a motion?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved. Rivera-Malpiede.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
SHELLEY COOK: Shelley Cook, second.
PEGGY CATLIN: And Director Cook, second. Are there any objections to going, to entering
into executive session? Hearing none, we will exit this portion of the meeting and we will have
to re-enter when we adjourn from executive session.
So at this point, we will adjourn and re-enter [COMPUTER NOISE] on the link provided on
your calendar. Thank you.

We also have Gregg Moser, Barbara McManus, Melanie Snyder. And on the phone we have, as I
mentioned, Director Cook. We have John McKay. We have, is it Sienna with Fox News? We
have Ed Sealover. We have somebody whose number ends in 84. Could we say who are please?
NATALIE MENTEN: That's likely me. This is Menten.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. And then it looks like we have another person whose number ends in 24
that is not Director Cook.
KAREN YOUNG: Hello?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
KAREN YOUNG: Yeah, that's Karen Young. I told you before.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Karen Young, that's right.
KAREN YOUNG: With RTD.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So it is now 4:03. we. Have exited out of our executive session and we
have received guidance from the committee on the next steps and parameters of our negotiation
with our pending CEO. And so I thank you all for the valuable discussion. I think we have an
idea of what our next steps will be with our conversations with Ms. Johnson.
I would like-- well, are there any other matters to come before this committee? Seeing none, I'd
like to ask for a motion to adjourn.
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek, so moved.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Buzek moved and Chair Rivera-Malpiede, second. All those in
favor.
IN UNISON: Aye.
PEGGY CATLIN: Are there any opposed? OK. We are adjourned at 4:04 on September 9, 2020.
Thank you all for your participation.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
