Feb 11 2020 0400 PM Executive Search GMOC
Committee 2020 Committee
PEGGY CATLIN: --Search/GMOC Committee meeting to order at 4:05 PM. Why don't we go
around the room to say who's present.
JUDY LUBOW: [CHUCKLING] Here I am, Judy Lubow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Angie Rivera-Malpiede.
SHELLEY COOK: Shelley Cook.
NATALIE MENTEN: Natalie Menten.
VINCE BUZEK: Vince Buzek.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Shontel Lewis.
JEFF WALKER: Jeff Walker.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Lynn Guissinger.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Barbara McManus.
PEGGY CATLIN: Peggy Catlin. We have every single member of the committee here and our
alternate, as well as Director Lubow. The first item on the agenda, review the GM contract.
Actually, tonight we are going to have Brett Painter, the attorney whom we hired to negotiate the
contract, give a brief update on the process and what terms were agreed to in the contract. So that
will be at 5:30.
LYNN GUISSINGER: At 5:30 to the Board Meeting?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, we'll have a Special Board Meeting, a Special Board Meeting at 5:30.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Exeutive session?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can I say something?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I just want to take this opportunity to really thank Peggy and
Vince for really delving in and getting this done. It took a lot of work. And I just want to say
thank you.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

PEGGY CATLIN: For the record, Director Tisdale has joined the group.
JUDY LUBOW: Was it enjoyable?
PEGGY CATLIN: Was it enjoyable? It was a little stressful.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It was a blast.
PEGGY CATLIN: But we got it done, which is, I think, the important thing, or Brett got it done.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You got it done, too.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, so now we have a review of the strategic priorities for the IGM, Interim
General Manager. And there were really-- that was included in all of the documents that Barbara
sent you yesterday. Was it yesterday?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --pages six through nine.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you much.
PEGGY CATLIN: So pages six through nine. And it said at the top of the page, possible interim
GM action steps for the next six months-- develop short-, medium-, and long-term plans to
address operator shortages and dropped runs; explore effectiveness of the Reimagine RTD
process with regard to speed and discussions; hold listening sessions with stakeholders; to coin
Paul Ballard's phrase, lunch box briefings; be briefed on the lawsuit with DTP; analyze budget
issues, including FasTracks; leverage the interim's insights, perspectives, and experience; and
focus on user experience and decision making.
So those were the ones that were addressed. The top two were the short-, medium-, and longterm plans to address operator shortages and then explore the effectiveness of the Reimagine
RTD process. So those were the T top priorities that the Board selected. Does anybody have any
comment or-LYNN GUISSINGER: It felt to me a little bit like people were just putting their votes out first. It
was a little happenstance of who gets listed at the top of the ballot. So I wouldn't mind if we took
the numbers off. But I'm not going to die on my sword over it.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, well, I think given that we don't want to overprescribe what an
experienced CEO might be doing, this is just a guideline, I think.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: And I would like to add that one of the things that the Chair and I talked
about was if we get this contract signed-- if we get this contract signed tonight-- would he be
available for some phone briefings and that kind of thing, just to get him up to speed, so he can
hit the ground running when he starts on the 26th. And I think that's something-LYNN GUISSINGER: [INAUDIBLE] here to testify on the 25th, so that the legislators can see
him. Because I think he's [INAUDIBLE]. We can talk about that later.
SHELLEY COOK: I agree with all that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
VINCE BUZEK: We can talk to Brett Painter about that tonight.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, we can discuss that with him.
SHONTEL LEWIS: How would this be presented to him, like this in this format?
PEGGY CATLIN: I mean, we can discuss that here. He'll have a copy of this because it came
out of the Board retreat.
BARBARA MCMANUS: This is just raw data-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's for discussion to how to bring forward.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with Director Guissinger or Director Catlin-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: But I think that's a good point. I mean, not being overly prescriptive is what
you said and-PEGGY CATLIN: And utilize his management and leadership skills-LYNN GUISSINGER: Especially because we don't have a number next to utilize
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: What do you think about taking the numbers off of that?
JUDY LUBOW: I have a comment.

PEGGY CATLIN: Yes?
JUDY LUBOW: I'm just concerned. I like the idea of not requiring things. But I think it would
be useful for him to know that the first one got 13 votes. So it's a big issue on the part of the
Board's ideas.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I think we could still take the numbers off and present to him.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL LEWIS: And then he can figure out how he might prioritize the others. But I think
you can see that in the media.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: So we can perhaps put that one in a bigger font.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: In bold.
JUDY LUBOW: And a star.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, OK. Any other comm--? I mean, this is really from the Board. We're
using it as a guide for moving ahead with the interim GM.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: And as much as anything, conveying where we are currently on things and
stuff like that.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. It's just to give him a sense, so he can get started. OK. The draft charter
Barbara had prepared, and it's that second handout. And I have to admit that because I was
immersed in some other issues, such as the contract, I did not read this draft charter and provide
comments. But we do need to get this going, especially in the next phase of our efforts. So if you
could indulge me, could I give everybody maybe 24 hours to look it over and provide any
comments to Barbara.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It would be getting a second review now at this point anyway-PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So it doesn't matter.
PEGGY CATLIN: If we can take a look at this charter and provide any feedback to Barbara
tomorrow or Thursday maybe. Well-BARBARA MCMANUS: I would say Friday.

PEGGY CATLIN: Friday? OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because we're not going to be meeting again in the next couple of
weeks.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So if you could all give comments for the charter by Friday, that would
be appreciated.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Also, going back to the retreat-PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I thought that you might want to do a quick review of re-looking at
the 2020 goals because-PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, OK.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --we'll also be talking about it with him as a new item.
PEGGY CATLIN: So Barbara reminded me, which is appropriate, that we had a long discussion
at our retreat about review of the 2020 goals and more importantly, review of the specific tactical
measures. And so I think we need-- is there anything that you would want to change with regard
to this in terms of early dialogue with Mr. Ballard?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Which one are you-- Are you back here?
PEGGY CATLIN: It's back on page six of nine of the first document.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Next one, this one. So it would be in the ones up at the top?
PEGGY CATLIN: No, the ones at the top are the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: (WHISPERING) What, if anything, needs to be postponed-JUDY LUBOW: And what did you do ask of us?
PEGGY CATLIN: Hm?
JUDY LUBOW: What did you just ask from us?
PEGGY CATLIN: Again, in terms of briefing Mr. Ballard before he comes on board-- just the
things that we want to communicate to him are our Board's priorities. And one of the things that

we discussed was review of the 2020 goals that are set a year ago. And in light of some of the
circumstantial issues that we've had facing the agency, what measures might need to be adjusted,
especially the tactical goals and thinking in terms of ridership and those types of [INAUDIBLE].
NATALIE MENTEN: What's your review process on that that we discussed it, yes, at a Saturday
meeting and made some amendments and even in some cases added on.
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-hm.
NATALIE MENTEN: But typically, we vote on the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: --2020, so what would be that process? Is our Saturday discussion the
end, or would we bring it forward as an official action? I'm asking. I don't know.
PEGGY CATLIN: And that's a good question. We can bring it forward as an agenda item at the
next-BARBARA MCMANUS: So I think maybe what would happen is after-PEGGY CATLIN: That's a good question, though, because it wouldn't be memorialized in a
resolution unless we did that.
NATALIE MENTEN: And I also expressed this as backing up, that staff bases the 2020 budget
for now two months into-PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
NATALIE MENTEN: And they aren't even aware, as far as I know, what we talked about on
Saturday. But go ahead. I'm sorry.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I think there is some suggested topics on page 8. I think the one
major item was that we discussed ridership in some way, shape, or form fall off because of
everything that was going on with Reimagine and the downsizing of the service reductions. And
then what we would probably do is bring something forward that outlines what those changes
were along with the strategic priorities that we would want the interim General Manager to be
working on.
We would bring that forward as a single action item so that the staff has some marching orders
that they can align the budget to. That's how I see it. And I spoke to Heather about that for a little
bit. So that's up for discussion. If this group sees it moving forward in a different way, we can
talk about it.
NATALIE MENTEN: So big bubble to 2020, and then the bubble overlapping is Ballard with
his focus.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, because some are part of 2020, and some are not. And then the
2020 has changed a bit.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: And to the extent there is the overlap, I kind of feel like taking a step, and
then get Paul Ballard on board, get some input about these things as well from him and what he
begins to see, rather than giving him some marching orders at the outset. I keep wanting to go
back to what you said, and that is rely on the experience and objective take he'll have on things.
So I just don't want to go too far down saying this is your marching orders, you know?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I think he would be part of that discussion because if he's not
comfortable with it, then we need to know that and why.
PEGGY CATLIN: So our next Board meeting is-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: --the 25th. So if we can get an agenda item at least with respect to what the
Board talked about at its retreat, at least that'll give him-BARBARA MCMANUS Well, he's not here for that.
PEGGY CATLIN: I know. But he'll have the benefit of the information. We'll give him some
idea of the Board's priorities.
LYNN GUISSINGER: He's not here for what, the 25th?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, he might decide to come. But his start date is the 26th. We're
inviting him.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we're going to invite him as of tomorrow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: But his first day is the 25th.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Basically.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Correct.

PEGGY CATLIN: But your point about needing to memorialize this by a resolution, I think, is a
good one. So let's try to do that at the Board meeting.
NATALIE MENTEN: And I'm simply asking because then what we-- like, three, four, five days,
whatever it is, later, then we have the Board/SLT (Senior Leadership Team) retreat, although our
focus would be 2021 normally.
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-hm.
NATALIE MENTEN: But are we then also going to have another, hey, we are re-evaluating
2020 because of these changing priorities, fires, challenges, opportunities-- whatever you want to
label it. I don't know.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have a question about that, too. I'm wondering if this is an
unusual year because then-NATALIE MENTEN: Answer, yes. [LAUGHTER]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: Sorry, recording.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is that we work on this now and then have another joint meeting
later on in the year for the 2021 goals because we won't have worked on them, right? And we
need to move forward.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we would be starting to work on them on the 7th. And you were
talking about memorializing it on the 25th, which means we would probably not have had the
opportunity to meet with Mr. Ballard prior to the 25th. So I think that date is too soon.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We can talk about a date. We can think about a date over the next few
days and think what works. Just as an overview, I was planning-- I've been working with
Heather. The staff, of course, is putting together a plan to get Mr. Ballard up to speed. But his
start date is the 26th.
And I'm planning on having a meet and greet with all of the Board members with Mr. Ballard.
And then I'll also be sitting down with him, just giving him the lay of the land-- the meeting
structure, the meeting cycle, all of that-- on that same day. So we'll have an opportunity at that
point in time to-- I'm sure he's going to come in with ideas. And I'm sure they're going to come in
right out of the gate. So I just wanted to throw that out there so that you knew that that was
planned tentatively at this point with him.

LYNN GUISSINGER: For when?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Wednesday the 26th.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Because they have service change public meetings up Boulder County
that night.
BARBARA MCMANUS: At what time?
LYNN GUISSINGER: 6:00.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. so this would be during the day.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: --here the 25th, then maybe we could combine that.
PEGGY CATLIN: For this group, I would offer a suggestion in terms of if the 25th is too soon, I
would suggest, since these goals are so tied to the 2020 budget, that we take it up in the Finance
and Audit Committee meeting-BARBARA MCMANUS: In March?
PEGGY CATLIN: In March.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: So we wouldn't have to wait for the whole-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
[? PEGGY CATLIN: ?] --full Board meeting.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: We can also have a special meeting with just the Board and Mr.
Ballard. I mean, it can still be noticed. It can be on whenever we choose it to be. I mean, we may
want to have it separate. There's a lot of information, as you know, in all the packets that you
have to absorb to make decisions and think about what he's coming on board with.
So we may want to separate it. So think about that as well. We could do an overview in the
Finance. But then we could meet with him whenever we needed to to get him up to speed where
everybody's comfortable.
PEGGY CATLIN: So an action item with this is a timeline for the Board adopting these goals.
OK.

JUDY LUBOW: I'm still a little confused about what exactly we'll be showing him. I mean, we
have the 2020 goals. At our last retreat, our Board only retreat, we came up with some suggested
changes. Ultimately, I don't know what we're going to be showing him about what we feel needs
to happen.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think we would show him this with the numbers taken out, just to say this is
a sense to give him the sense of what our priorities are.
JUDY LUBOW: So in other words, we're basically going to be saying, OK, page six is what
we're going to be showing him.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I think this whole packet-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --out of the retreat is of interest to him.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, he doesn't know anything about the goals right now. I mean,
he probably has been poking around out online. I'm sure he has. So what collectively happens
with what's going on for 2020 will probably come out of the retreat on March 7th.
JUDY LUBOW: OK, so when he comes on, so assuming that we should do is talk with him and
say this packet will tell you what the goals were for 2020, but the changes that the Board is
thinking would be appropriate given the change of circumstance.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: I think I think the more information we can provide to him in advance, the
better prepared he will be to hit the ground running.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I agree.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I don't think maybe other than taking out the scores, as Director
Guissinger suggested. We're just providing all of this.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And this group also can go through this document and do a quick
outline with less detail of what we think is captured in this.
JUDY LUBOW: I think that would be good-- a kind of executive summary.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL LEWIS: It might be beneficial for us as Directors to figure out what our priorities are
because this is kind of a lot of stuff.
JUDY LUBOW: It's a lot.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's a lot.
SHONTEL LEWIS: And so we might think about if we were to put our issues into two buckets-is it workforce-- is it budget? Like, where do we want him to focus, not specific actions, but
generally where we would like for him to focus to-PEGGY CATLIN: And I think that's why we have those top two as the top two priorities.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Got it, OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: And we can highlight those-- put them in bold or whatever. But these are
other things that came up as part of everything that the Board has going here.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Sure, OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And just throwing it out there that the N line is not on this. And it is-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: So this again, was a guideline that came out of the retreat.
JUDY LUBOW: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And you know-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: I think it needs an executive summary, basically. I mean, because this is almost
like stream of consciousness. And I think it would be better to say these are the main themes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We also don't have the Senate bill on here.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVEAR-MALPIEDE: We have a few things.
JUDY LUBOW: Things are moving so quickly.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I think if we give him this, it just needs to be said.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: We need another one-pager.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: So we need a one-pager that provides context and then, oh, by the way.
JUDY LUBOW: And the new things.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The oh, by the way, clause-PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --or paragraph.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Do you want to assign that to someone?
PEGGY CATLIN: I was just going to ask if there were volunteers for writing that.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I can work on it with somebody.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: I can work on it too. But I'm going to be out of town Thursday and Friday.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, Shelley, you'll work on a-SHELLEY COOK: With Judy Lubow.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Whatever you need me to send, you just let me know. I can send you
the 2020 full goals that you can take components out of. The ridership piece we know is sort of
dropping off. So you might want to give a little red line of what we're looking at between these
two documents.

PEGGY CATLIN: OK. So we're getting comments to Shelley and Judy on a draft document.
What time line do you all think-- I think the sooner we can get this to Mr. Ballard, the better.
JUDY LUBOW: I agree.
PEGGY CATLIN: And so I think we should shoot for the end of the week again.
SHELLEY COOK: It just so happens that I have extra time.
JUDY LUBOW: You do?
SHELLEY COOK: Mm-hm.
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, goody.
SHELLEY COOK: Should never have said that, right?
JUDY LUBOW: [LAUGHTER] You can take my part.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: So just focusing on page eight in the middle section, which is where I
think everybody is at, but just so everybody's clear, so the suggestions for topics to include in
this retreat-- that's what we're going to use because the header that's here for the agenda retreat,
this is the what we're going to nail down. And we're talking about taking out the vote numbers.
JUDY LUBOW: Where are you looking? I'm sorry.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Page eight.
JUDY LUBOW: And where?
VINCE BUZEK: Right in the middle-- suggestions and topics.
JUDY LUBOW: OK, thank you. Thank you very much.
NATALIE MENTEN: So that's where our attention has been in the last 10 minutes or 15. And
this was for the agenda. But we're talking about for his tasks. So I guess I'm summarizing that.
And then if we took off the numbers and we handed him all of these, I don't-- That's a little bit
confusing, frankly. Also, we got-- sorry, but sensitivity training-- and we've got this, and we've
got that.
JUDY LUBOW: [LAUGHTER]

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: And I'm sorry, one last thing.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: And so I do want to note where my item-- have Heather share cost times
on her wish list. And I'd like to refine that. What that meant was cost of strategic goals.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
NATALIE MENTEN: And that really needs to be clear because I think just like our 2020 goals,
our header was with maintaining fiscal sustainability, these five items should be maintained. So
with all of that now, should I send any of the edit suggestions to Shelley?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
NATALIE MENTEN: Shelley's going to head up [INAUDIBLE].
SHELLEY COOK: Judy and I are--.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: So you could note there what my task was was get a good grasp of the
cost of our strategic goals.
PEGGY CATLIN: Excuse me.
JUDY LUBOW: Mm-hm.
PEGGY CATLIN: Reporter John Aguilar is about to enter the room.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair, if I may? One thought relative to sharing this with Mr. Ballard
is perhaps to leave these numbers in. I have to confess that if you don't have those in there, he
may, understandably, think, for example, that the full Board said that an important topic was for
us to discuss sensitivity awareness training, which I think is an important topic. But I don't think
it was the full Board. So I think if you take away the numbers, you prioritize everything to-PEGGY CATLIN: It dilutes the most important things.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: I don't mind having the numbers in there. What about--

BARBARA MCMANUS: So this is a draft that came from-DOUG TISDALE: Susan.
BARBARA MCMANUS: From Susan. Discussing sensitivity awareness should be a full Board
thing. And that should probably go under some of the learning sessions that we talked about
having moving forward as a full Board. So I don't know that that's actually going to make it on as
an agenda item.
Some of these things are going to fall out into different places. But Susan didn't know that
structure or where it would go. So John and I will be working with her on the agenda. And we'll
socialize it with the full Board before we move forward with it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Sounds good.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And then based on some of the things that are here, the executive
summary will back up some of the priorities that we're taking from the rest of what was captured.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: So if we are going to provide this document with Mr. Ballard, as just a sense
of where the Board is at, can we do a watermark with draft on it-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, absolutely.
PEGGY CATLIN: --so he knows that that's still up for discussion? Let's just do that.
SHELLEY COOK: But I still believe that giving him as much information as we can is going to
help him and help the agency.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And we'll attach the executive summary in front of it so that he'll gain
his own ideas from this. But he'll also know what the full group feels.
PEGGY CATLIN: So we will have an executive summary and an oh, by the way.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Mm-hm.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Process for engaging with search firm-- Barbara, you included that in
our packet as well.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, what I have put in was the sample evaluation form and the
confidentiality agreement that goes with it just because I think there's only two, three folks on the
current Board right now that have been through this process of hiring an outside vendor. There's
a little bit of work that's attached to it, so I wanted to give everybody a heads up that when the
packets go out to you-- we'll probably get paper copies to you-- you'll do the review of all of the
responses. You'll do the evaluation for each of those groups.

And then we'll email you the evaluation forms. And they would like you to type out your
evaluations on that form and bring it with you for discussion. So it'll be about a two-hour
meeting. It's scheduled for Thursday, March 19, noon to 2:00, which is outlined on one of the
documents that I included in here.
SHONTEL LEWIS: March 19th?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, March 19th. You told me not the 20th. The 19th was fine.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, no.
JUDY LUBOW: [LAUGHTER] Too bad.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, I'll change my plans. I just saw that. OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So and then-- included is the overall timeline.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Now, we're thinking that there may be some questions asked by the
vendors. There usually are. And so we included that in there as well. Sometimes there's a request
for oral presentations.
There is a particular venue-- I don't know. I mean, it's who sings the nicest songs. So I don't
know if in this particular instance that we would need that. But we did add that in there just in
case a decision couldn't be made or we did want to have a second interview or face to face with
any of those folks.
PEGGY CATLIN: I like that as a place holder.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: It also builds in some extra time if there are some issues running
through the process. And then a final selection by March 31. And hopefully, by the first or
second week in April, we have a draft timeline that they would be looking at for us to figure out
the rest of the elements on. They were all given a copy of the Board calendar so that they could
see how busy we are. And of course, we know not nearly everything is on it.
PEGGY CATLIN: So this group all did see the draft RFP, correct?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mm-hm.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
NATALIE MENTEN: Did we?

PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: You didn't see the formal one that came out of procurement that was
sent, but the scope-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: Was that the one by Linda?
PEGGY CATLIN: That was the one that Lynn and I worked on.
JUDY LUBOW: Can I get a copy of that so I can look at it?
PEGGY CATLIN: The scope of work?
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: We're going to send it out. OK, but that went out last Friday?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: It went out last Friday.
SHONTEL LEWIS: To the Board or general public.
SHELLEY COOK: To list of firms?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's this one.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It went out to fall to all of the search firms that we're asking to
respond.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: Oh, thank you. Is that for me?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: And then we will augment this schedule when we have a discussion about the
outreach efforts and who we want to engage and to what extent we want to leverage some of the
things that we're already doing. I had a discussion with Pauletta about that.
And there are some ways that we could number one, streamline the process from what happened
five years ago, and also reduce the costs from what happened and not make it fully blown. So I

think that would be a topic for one of our next meetings. I know that they had a discussion at the
SLT about other ideas so that it doesn't necessarily mirror the exact process that took place five
years ago.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, so I'd like to just speak about that a little bit. So the last two
searches what they did and this is outside of these regular meetings. There were seven hosted
listening sessions by the Board at each of the districts-- Platte, East Metro, District Shops,
FasTracks, Elati, Boulder, Blake. And of course, we would have to add 711 to this list as well
going forward. And that's for employees.
There were three focus groups. There was a community focus group. There was an executive
focus group. And there was a civic leader panel that helped in the interview process for the
candidates when we got to that point. So those are just a few of the elements that were there last
time.
Now, we don't have to do those elements this time. We can choose to do some of them, the exact
duplicate of what we did, something totally different. But in speaking with Pauletta, we are going
to utilize, hopefully, the telephone town halls to broach this subject in because it hits such a
broad spectrum.
And also, once we have all of the materials put together from our Marketing Department, as well
as updating the interim General Manager website to the permanent General Manager website that
already exists, we would do additional public outreach using social media and also include the
email address that was out there for the interim General Manager. We'll just change the name of
it. But it will stay in place, and then any other elements that this group and the rest of the Board
want to include.
JUDY LUBOW: I just wanted to say that I went through the last one. And I'm not sure how to
say this. But I think we didn't get a lot of bang for our buck. I think there was a lot of outreach, a
lot of, in my opinion, almost spinning our wheels.
And when I compare that to what we just did for the interim where I feel we got pretty much a
great selection of people where we spent no money, I mean, I don't want it to be considered that
we're being cheap. But I think it was overboard last time. And I don't think we learned that much.
And I would just urge just to be very careful.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, to your point about what we did in engaging input for the interim
General Manager search, I think that can really be counted toward outreach because we learned a
great deal from our stakeholders and from our employees and a lot of things about the qualities
that they wanted to see in an interim General Manager. And I would suggest that that would
translate to a permanent General Manager. So we've done a lot of the groundwork already.
JUDY LUBOW: And I agree.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, and I think we can really launch from that point as opposed to starting
over. So I agree with you. And Pauletta does have some other ideas about how to streamline and

take a look at the process to still make sure that we include stakeholders and community but
maybe in a slightly less grandiose way.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, however, the conversation that I had with her was she could
implement, but she cannot take this on.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, that's true.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So we just have to decide what elements are already in place for 2020
in Communications and leverage those-PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --to the best that we can, and then figure out what the RFP needs to
say. And I just want to end that conversation with the research that I did. Each-- of course, not
the employee sessions but the focus groups-- the way they were done the last time in this time
frame, it's between $6,000 and $8,000 per focus group. That's right off the top doing the focus
groups without any of the other elements we would be looking for in putting out the RFP.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We've got a lot of groups. We got great response. We can put it online
again. We've got the Reimagine technical and advisory groups. Maybe we can-PEGGY CATLIN: Leverage those.
SHELLEY COOK: Or CAC.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's what Pauletta and I talked about as well.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Menten had something to say. She had her hand up.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, I would just like to know, could I see the original budget for what
was $400,000 and then has that now been amended to reflect $200,000.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that was just an amount they were moving to be sure it was more
than enough.
PEGGY CATLIN: It was a placeholder. I don't think it was detailed.
NATALIE MENTEN: So is there some sort of-- is there five categories or something that we've
got-- should we be discussing that as we're going into the discussion. As you know, I like to
know cost.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Heather took the total of what it cost the last time. And she inflated it
from 2015 to 2020. That's how the $400,000 came. What we changed to get to a different
number is totally different. I mean, we don't know.
PEGGY CATLIN: We have to work with them.
SHONTEL LEWIS: What were the main components of that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: The executive search firm, the community strategic outreach, and the
focus groups. And then-PEGGY CATLIN: There were three consultants.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, and then the two external law firms.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, and just wanted to comment-- having gone through it, and I think
what I remember on our seven hosted listening sessions is two Board members would go to each
so that we didn't trigger any kind of problems. And I got to say, from memory, maybe seven or
10 employees.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: But I don't remember it being very valuable.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that we need to have a discussion about this. And I would suggest
bringing Pauletta in to the mix and Heather. And then we can just talk about a plan going
forward because I do think you're right that it might have been overkill.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, I just wanted to give an overview of the past. And I invite
anybody to send any of their ideas and thoughts about it, because I will be pulling all these
elements together, sitting down with Pauletta, and bringing all of your comments as well to see
what we want this to look like.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Walker-- excuse me. Director, you were involved in the last go
round, too. What are your thoughts?
JEFF WALKER: I wouldn't say that we didn't get a big bang for the buck because I don't know
what the alternative would have produced. A lot of folks had the opportunity to comment, which
is valuable, even if it wasn't taken great advantage of, at least the opportunity was there. That's
worth something. So the focus groups that we had, the enthusiasm wasn't there. And I don't know
why. I don't remember why. It's five years ago now.
But it seemed like there wasn't a whole lot of excitement that I sensed, rather than the folks who
were upset that Phil was leaving to begin with. But there wasn't a whole lot of excitement in the

air that I sensed. But I wouldn't say that they weren't valuable because I have no idea what the
alternative is-- what that other possibility was if we had not.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker, can I just ask you a question. How many
people were in those focus groups?
JEFF WALKER: 10.
BARBARA MCMANUS: You mean the panels themselves?
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, are you talking about the panels?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I have those lists.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, about 10. But Miss McManus has an exact number.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So for the community focus, 12. For the executive focus group, 11.
And then for the civic leader panel, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- six.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lewis, you had a question or a comment?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I was curious about the hosted listen sessions and the focus groups and the
executive panel. What was the purpose? And how did we use the information we collected to
inform the process?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I can only speak to that on a cursory level. But the civic leaders
actually interviewed-- they used sort of a SWOT model to interview the different candidates.
And then they brought forward to the Board who they think based on that analysis could help the
metropolitan area of RTD and the snapshot of what they were doing at that point in time.
Of course, the listening sessions for the employees were, what didn't you like in the past; you
know, General Manager, what would you like to see, what changes would you make, a lot of
what we do on a regular basis anyway, what we did for the interim General Manager, part of
what Director Menten and Director Lubow and a couple of other folks are gathering information
in the districts about different subjects. The community focus group pretty much they were made
up of managing partners and mayors, leaders of industry, and community activists. They
basically talked about what the need of transportation was.
And we had these recorded. But we can't find the recordings at all. A lot of this information I
have found in different places because they were here in the Board Office. And then so basically,
we got input from all different levels. It was just to hear what everybody said-- what they
wanted, what they didn't like, what they wanted to see happen-- sort of a wish list.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah. How did we use it?

BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we brought it all back to the Board. We watched the listening
sessions. I mean, you can probably speak better to me. I wasn't in all of those sessions, Director.
But you and Director Lubow were if you attended and Director Menten.
The strategic communications group captured all the information and brought it back. And then
they looked for common threads. And then they looked for those attributes in the candidates that
were brought forward
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Walker, did you have something to say?
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, I was just going to say that just like we did with our exercise on
Saturday, a couple Saturdays ago, this is the theme that we're hearing so that would going to our
search firm. This is how I'm remembering it, so if I'm wrong, correct me. And then that
information would come to us. And this is what we're hearing. Send that to the search firm.
He's got the resumes. He talks to the candidates, so he knows what we're looking for. He knows
what they have to offer. And then he would say OK, so these are the folks who meet these
qualifications. Does that sound-PEGGY CATLIN: Director Menten, did you have a comment?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, I can remember. Like, I believe that the employees kept wanting to
say I've been here, like, this many years. And I liked this with this old General Manager, which
they might didn't even know. And I like the trait in this one. And this one was horrible on this.
And this guy was kind of off of-- you know, just-SHONTEL LEWIS: I ask because we might think about if we didn't have a lot of-- if we had low
numbers, we might think about how we are letting the public know how we will be using the
information. So is it to come up with characteristics? Is it come up with questions that we might
ask candidates? Is it to plan a community conversation about like, engagement folks tend to not
show up because they don't know how their information that's collected is going to be used.
JEFF WALKER: I think all the information was anonymous. I could see, when I was at CRL, I
could see the people talking. But I don't think that their comments were associated with a name.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Not quite. I just mean generally. So if we were asking the public, hey, we'd
love for you to come to a focus group, and the reason that we're putting this focus group on is
because this is how we're going to build the job description. This are the characteristics we're
looking for when we're reviewing applicants or this is how we're going to use it to design a
rubric to evaluate candidates.
And it doesn't sound like that was the case. Like, we may, in this iteration, think about how we're
intentional about the information we extract from those conversations, how we're using them to
inform our process. And it's not just like an activity.

JEFF WALKER: No, that's what we did with it. That's how we built the profile of the candidate
that we want. We used--.
SHONTEL LEWIS: That's what I was asking.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, we took the information, sent to our search firm. And he went through
the resumes-- matches, doesn't match, match, doesn't match.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I would suggest that we've already got quite a bit of that in a lot of the
comments that we read prior to the-JEFF WALKER: Right.
JUDY LUBOW: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: --interim search. So I think we could probably streamline that process a little
bit. I have another suggestion. We've already moved on to timing moving forward. Here's
something that I would like to throw out. Mr. Ballard himself may have some really good ideas.
And he offered to kind of assess and advise.
So I would suggest that at our next meeting that we have Mr. Ballard brainstorm with us some
ideas about moving forward and the best way to do that. I was reminded by some folks that when
a city council hires a city manager, they don't go to the outside to ask for input. When Governor
Polis selected his Director of Transportation, he got some feedback from his transition
committee. But they didn't go out to the public at large. RTD-- And corporations don't do that for
their CEOs.
And so I'm saying that I think we're very generous and very transparent in wanting to do some
engagement, but that we're probably the only public agency that does that. So just kind of give
that some thought. And think about how we can still get input from our communities and
stakeholders, but try to keep our costs down and our process not overly complicated. So that's all
I would suggest.
SHELLEY COOK: Agreed.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes?
JEFF WALKER: And one other thing is that we can build expectations of all-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: Well, this is what I said I wanted. How come this person you hired doesn't
have these qualifications-PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.

JEFF WALKER: --or this experience? Yeah, so that's a danger. That's a risk, some exposure that
we have-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: --meet what we've heard. But you might be right for the-- because internally,
that person [INAUDIBLE].
PEGGY CATLIN: So I think it's good, as you suggest, that this is how we will use your input to
make an informed selection. But it's not a democracy. We're not voting in the CEO.
SHELLEY COOK: We are worried about that with the interim. And it worked out just fine. And
I think we were good to stress that it was one component of the evaluation.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lubow?
JUDY LUBOW: I just want to affirm that because my memory of the prior usage and the prior
picking of that candidate, the other input didn't have that much to do with it, in my opinion-- that
basically, it's true we were looking at certain people. But we basically were going on a feel for
their experience, their strengths, et cetera. And I think that's going to happen again. So I don't
think we should raise expectations too much about what public input is going to do. I think it's
useful as one item. But that's it.
PEGGY CATLIN: For an informed selection-JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: --not a-JUDY LUBOW: Not to really determine it.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, so in the first meeting that we schedule after Mr. Ballard's on board, we
can have a discussion about this and perhaps bring Pauletta in to see how we can leverage what's
already on the calendar like our telephone town halls.
SHELLEY COOK: And make decisions about things like focus groups later.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, just kind of outline a process.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, do we-- I just want to throw out there that the community
outreach runs in tandem with the search.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right.

BARBARA MCMANUS: And so we're looking at a very tight frame, so to even think we have
time to put anything off for any amount of time, we need to look at that. I just wanted to throw
that out there. It's sounding to me like we want to do less than what we did last time. So-SHELLEY COOK: We're definitely-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm not necessarily saying that. And then I know that there are many other
folks that are saying that. I think we have an opportunity to show that we're being transparent in
this process as an agency. And I think lessening our outreach doesn't-- may not yield that.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL LEWIS: I will also say that when Denver Public Schools selected their
superintendent, they actually did go out to the public and ask. They had a number of focus
groups that informed the candidate profile.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you for that example. That's good. Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: I know we've mentioned telephone town hall a few times. And I think
telephone town halls can be more expensive than people would think. They can be $50,000,
$60,000. We have $200,000 to work with completely. And hopefully, we stay well below that.
But the value of telephone town halls is to share a message going out. And if you want
responses, then you've got caller or listener press one because you like this. And you like this
thing. We've told you three.
That's a far different thing than here's an email portal with Survey Monkey or something like
that, where they're able to populate that cell with their responses, so before we would jump to
maybe telephone town hall. Because I know what that is in the check register. It's not $3,000 or
$4,000.
PEGGY CATLIN: If I might, the suggestion was not to hold additional telephone town halls.
The idea was to have a question or two tagged onto the already planned telephone town halls in
the budget and to leverage what's already out there in the plan and utilize that as one way of
gathering information.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you. That's very helpful to know.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Just a quick thought.

PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
SHONTEL LEWIS: You're saying that our next meeting that we would have, that's when we
would take the opportunity to outline the specifics of the process or [INAUDIBLE].
PEGGY CATLIN: That's what I was suggesting.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK. And it sounds like Barbara may be saying that we don't have time to do
it at our next meeting-- that we may need to figure that out right here and now. Is that fair?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we'll have to schedule a meeting sooner than what we were
thinking on the calendar.
SHONTEL LEWIS: All right, I'm just-- this is selfish, but I'm out of town the 26th through
March 1st, I'm taking my kid to college, so I won't be here.
JUDY LUBOW: Good. [LAUGHTER]
BARBARA MCMANUS: So one of the things that I have on my list that didn't make it on the
agenda is availability and established dates. So if everybody from this group would send me an
email of dates from now till the end of the year as much as you know when you're not available,
we would need to utilize that as part of what the executive search team would do in planning
meetings in order to bring forward what we have to bring forward and get the different focus
groups and all of the elements pulled together onto a single time line.
PEGGY CATLIN: So that means I need to tell my daughter-in-law what day she can have her
baby?
[LAUGHTER] [INTERPOSING VOICES]
JUDY LUBOW: It's called a C-section.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, get that worked out, Peggy.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'll do that. I was pretty good with my own kids. But I don't know about my--.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: Just narrow down what you're trying to nail into the calendar because
that's a huge ask when we have Directors-- I don't know about you, but I plan my schedule out
two weeks in advance. Not kidding. So you're trying to fit in-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, but you're not going on a three-week vacation to Paris.
NATALIE MENTEN: I don't even know what that word is. But you're trying to nail down the
outreach?

BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it's everything. I mean, there is going to be asks of this
committee from the executive search firm. There's going to be meetings like this that we have to
make decisions on moving forward with each of these groups and sort of put together a timeline
of whatever the focus groups look like, whatever the timeline of getting to finalists-- once we get
to finalist, what that timeline looks like because in that particular time frame, when you're
decision making, we're going to need everybody to be here to be part of it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Excuse me.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: I would suggest we start with a standing meeting. And the frequency could be
monthly. But start as a basis, and then augment as we need to. But I think we need to have some
consistency and regularity.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I would suggest we look at Tuesdays, since we're here
anyway. And we could do it just a little earlier than the Board meeting.
PEGGY CATLIN: Does this time frame seem to work for most of-BARBARA MCMANUS: OK, we'll need more time than this.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Most of the meetings will be longer than this-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --start earlier.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: 3:00? How many could do 3:00? You're thinking once a month?
PEGGY CATLIN: Once a month for the standing meeting.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well-SHELLEY COOK: On a Tuesday-NATALIE MENTEN: Once a month?
BARBARA MCMANUS: You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to look through last time
all the dates for all the meetings because we know there was a lot of them. I'm going to look at
the dates. And I'm going to make a long list of them. And I'm going to figure out what the
average frequency was.

PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because I don't know if one day is going to work. Because I don't
know if we're going to make these decisions in nine meetings. And [INAUDIBLE]-PEGGY CATLIN: Well, and my suggestion is that we have a standing meeting and then
augment it with other meetings. That's really where I wanted to start.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And mine is Tuesday. Since we're here every Tuesday, anyway,
might as well just fit it all in.
PEGGY CATLIN: Most Tuesdays.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Most Tuesdays, right.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah. Yes?
SHELLEY COOK: I was thinking somebody in my past experience, the executive search firm
had been able to coordinate some outreach. For example, in one case, we had kind of a parallel
set of interviews with our finalists. And one was a community group. And so under Item number
7, I don't know if they ever offered that sort of thing. It says finalize with the search committee
an effective process for interviews.
It wouldn't necessarily have to be just the Board or the executive search committee. It could be
also other groups that we identify. And maybe because it's part of the contract, or let's just see if
they offer that.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's a good point. yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I mean, I know that that's what happened before. But I don't know
if the two vendors worked together or whether the executive search firm did it. But when we
bring them on board, we can certainly ask that question.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: All right, the only other thing on the agenda is the assignment of buddies.
And it looks like the Board Office took a stab at pairing up-LYNN GUISSINGER: I like my buddy.
[LAUGHTER]
PEGGY CATLIN: Does anybody have any-- you can be our buddy.
[LAUGHTER]

PEGGY CATLIN: Really, the reason is just to make sure that those people who were not a part
of this committee get regular communication and updates. And I think if anybody has any
objections-BARBARA MCMANUS: And in the charter, it outlines what the responsibility of the buddy is
so that not only the buddy feels left out, but that the team member here knows what his
responsibility is to that buddy.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: So is there anything else, Barbara, that you had on your list?
BARBARA MCMANUS: No.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
NATALIE MENTEN: Are you sure we got the RFP?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: Because I'm looking. And I don't see RFP.
PEGGY CATLIN: Can we get that out-BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]
LYNN GUISSINGER: It was indicated as SOW, I think, scope of work.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
NATALIE MENTEN: You said it was last night?
BARBARA MCMANUS: No.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: It was last week.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I guess for the record, sir, would you like to introduce yourself so that
we have that on record that you [INAUDIBLE].
JOHN AGUILAR: I'm John Aguilar with the Denver Post.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.

SHONTEL LEWIS: So when we have our next meeting, will we use this document that we've
used in the past at all to outline our-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHONTEL LEWIS: Are we just creating this from scratch? The Regional Transportation District
guidelines Board of Directors Documentation on Process for Hiring and Transitioning to a New
General Manager.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think we should use that as a starting point.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I mean, the Board decided not to use that guideline on the interim
process.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We can certainly review it as a guideline moving forward. But there
were-LYNN GUISSINGER: I guess you could send that out-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: --as a reminder.
DOUG TISDALE: You will recall it was attached to your Board Meeting materials for the
December 3rd meeting because we had about 75 pages of materials. But-BARBARA MCMANUS: I can send it out again.
DOUG TISDALE: --I think it would be good to resend.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: And again, I think because we did quite a bit of work from December 3rd
through now, that I think that using that and then looking at that guideline and seeing where we
can-SHONTEL LEWIS: I just think there are some really-- I think there are some things that we all
might be interested in taking from here and adding it to our December 3 process.
PEGGY CATLIN: I agree. All right, any other comments? OK, we are adjourned at 5:06-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
PEGGY CATLIN: One hour.
