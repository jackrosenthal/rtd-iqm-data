on-call firms: one for facilities and one for engineering. He
commented that, when the two departments merged into
Capital Programs, staff discovered that they only needed one
on-call firm and were using Short Elliot Hendrickson (SEH)
from facilities. He noted that SEH would be able to assist with
the Maintenance of Way facility for the North Metro Line as
well as other upgrades.

Mr. Stopplecamp commented that this action item related to a
piece of property on the North Metro corridor near 104th Ave.
He said that staff was asking for a permanent easement on a
piece of property adjacent to RTD’s for drainage and stated
that the property was currently being used for storm water
retention. He noted that this was not part of the original scope
of the corridor, but the property owner, the City of Thornton,
and RTD have all agreed that this land should be used for RTD.
Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Property, noted that this
would be a slope easement.
Director Hoy said that for clarification there would not be any
improvements to the land as it was currently used for storm
water retention.
Mr. Stopplecamp explained that there would not be any
improvements, but there would be a few modifications.
Ms. Altes stated that this action would cover work for grading
purposes and slope.
Director Hoy noted that he did not see anything in the Board
Report that related to cost. He said that staff was asking the
Board to spend money based on a future appraisal.
Director Menten asked if this property was at the northwest
corner of 104th and Colorado.
Mr. Stopplecamp commented that the property was located on
the southwest side of 104th Ave. and Colorado Blvd., just
west of RTD’s tracks.
Director Menten inquired as to who owned the property.
Ms. Altes remarked that the property was owned by Settler’s
Chase Master Association, Inc.
Director Menten asked if this property or any of the
surrounding properties would fall under the 50% special
evaluation rule.
Ms. Altes explained that staff had not identified any special
benefits to offset damages.

C. Updates

• 16th St. Mall
Mr. Van Meter said that he, along with Susan Wood, Planning Project
Manager, and Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Chief Engineering Senior Manager,
would provide a brief update on the alternatives analysis and the
environmental assessment for the 16th Street Mall.
Ms. Wood stated that when staff last updated the Board on this project,
they were near the end of the environmental alternatives process and the
environmental assessment. She noted that, since that time, a recommended
preferred alternative had been selected, and to recap that selection she said
that the alignment of the transit way would be shifted, the wide center
median between Tremont and Arapahoe would be removed, and the current
pattern and materials would be kept. She said that the granite pavers were
part of the original historic design, which made the mall culturally significant.
She remarked that RTD was not supportive of granite, but the stakeholders
have indicated that it was important to keep granite for the transit way and
sidewalks.
Ms. Wood added that RTD had two grant funds allocated for this project
that totaled $15 million dollars and explained that the $15 million would be
RTD’s maximum contribution to the capital program costs. She further
Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 3, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano asked if RTD needed to consult with the
Secretary of State for this change.

6.A

added that RTD reviewed potential future maintenance costs for the mall
with the intent of minimizing RTD’s impacts for operations, but those
discussions were still ongoing.

Ms. Wood commented that once approval was granted by the FTA, by late
October or early November, a notice to proceed for final design and
construction would begin in 2019 and the project should be completed by
2022.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what RTD’s maintenance costs would be with
the new design.
Ms. Wood explained that there are still ongoing discussions regarding what
exactly the maintenance costs would be. She said there was a lot of detailed
work underway to get to that point but it was still in progress.
Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired what the maintenance costs would be if the
transit way were changed from granite to concrete.
Ms. Vishwakarma explained that the 16th Street Mall was a different type of
street. She remarked that, if it were a normal roadway or a rural highway for
example, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) would say it would
cost $700 per year per lane mile. She commented that the 16th Street Mall
was not a rural highway and it had different conditions attached to it. She
noted that at the heart of the discussion was the historic designation and
mindset people have about the mall and how it should appear. She stated
that there were a lot of numbers out there and the consultant team put
together a few projections and estimated that the maintenance costs of the
new design would be $85,000 to $310,000 per year.
Mr. Van Meter stated that staff was very clear on the capital costs and the
capital costs commitment. He reiterated that RTD’s stance of minimizing
operating and maintenance cost exposures and operating impacts through
the maintenance process. He said that at this time, staff does not have
confidence in the exact numbers and costs, but they are not at that point in
the process yet. He noted that staff would have the ability to provide more
information to the Board in June.
Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 3, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Wood explained that the next steps were to have the final draft of the
assessment reviewed by the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA).
She commented that the assessment would be released to the public in
June, which would then begin the 30-day public comment period. She
stated that staff would come back and update the Board again on June 5th,
and then at the Board Meeting on June 26th, staff would ask the Board for
permission to release the environmental assessment for public review.

6.A

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what the capital costs were estimated to be.
Ms. Vishwakarma stated that the project consultants estimated the total
cost to range from $76 million up to $137 million for the project at that
time.

Chair Tisdale commented that, relative to the environmental assessment
process, the environmental assessment proceeds with the conclusion that
granite pavers would be used in lieu of patterned concrete, but he pointed
out that the current assessment had language which stated that granite
pavers were proposed in this assessment, and subject to an IGA to be
entered into between the parties. He said that it was clearly understood that
RTD did not say by joining in the environmental assessment that it would
assume the cost of maintenance associated with the project, or the
additional costs for capital construction at the onset. He noted that this was
an important clarification should the issue arise in the future.
Director Williams remarked that it appeared that RTD was liable and had
agreed to 20% of the total project costs, assuming the project cost $75
million. She asked if RTD was in the same position in terms of maintenance,
or if RTD was responsible for all of the maintenance costs.
Mr. Van Meter said no. He commented that the maintenance portion would
not fall solely to RTD but noted that it had not been finalized or determined.
Director Williams asked if there was a proration based on stakeholder
involvement.
Mr. Van Meter said that staff needed to look at various ways to divide the
maintenance costs equitably, and fairly, while also minimizing RTD’s costs.
He stated that there was no formula to fall back on, but staff was trying to
figure out how that would work.
Director Broom inquired whether there was a current formula in place for the
existing mall or whether RTD paid for all of the maintenance costs.
Mr. Van Meter explained that RTD only paid maintenance costs for the
transit way and noted that, in the past few years, the City and County of
Denver had contributed $300,000 on an annual basis to support those
efforts.
Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 3, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson said that RTD served many different communities. She
stated that she was looking forward to the environmental assessment and
public process with the culturally significant location and added that
everyone should be sensitive to those cultural and historical places while
also minimizing costs.

6.A

Director Broom asked if RTD’s past maintenance history costs would be
used to determine future maintenance liability.
Ms. Vishwakarma said that one of the project’s key objectives was to
minimize maintenance costs.

Committee Chair Lubow said that when staff first presented this information
to the Board the figures for the different alternatives were quite drastic. She
said that she would like to hear how much it would cost if the transit way
was concrete, and she would like to see the alternatives comparison again.
Ms. Vishwakarma said that information would be provided to the Board once
staff had better numbers.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if the reason RTD was maintaining the 16th
Street Mall was because RTD was an expert at maintaining roads, and asked
if the City of Denver was unable to maintain their vast system of roadways.
Ms. Vishwakarma stated that RTD had historically maintained the 16th Street
Mall roadway, which is covered in granite, and that was where RTD’s
expertise lies.
Mr. Van Meter added that it was experience on this particular roadway with
its operationally unique challenges.
Director Archuleta asked if granite pavers would be used for the new design.
Mr. Van Meter stated that granite pavers were the recommended locally
preferred alternative. He noted that the final decision would not be made
until further along in the process, but granite was the recommendation. He
added that because of that recommendation, RTD was stressing and
emphasizing that the agency’s maximum capital contribution will only be
$15 million, and the agency’s intent, desire, and direction is to minimize
future maintenance costs.
Director Archuleta asked why staff was going to use granite pavers when
the Board had specifically requested a different material.
General Manager Genova said that granite pavers would be used because
that was what the process selected, not RTD staff. He noted that when this
Packet Pg. 13

Ms. Wood added that the purpose and need for the project included a need
to decrease the frequency and cost of maintenance. She noted that RTD had
been very clear in meetings that the agency needed to reduce its
maintenance costs.

6.A

environmental process was applied, the outcome was the locally preferred
alternative.
Director Deadwyler stated that she had concerns with using granite pavers
as they could become slippery and cause injuries.

Director Broom asked if the mall redesign would allow buses to shift from
one side to another in case of an accident.
Ms. Vishwakarma said that was indeed a consideration, but she would know
more once the design process began.
Director Menten asked if the primary stakeholders RTD spoke with were the
City and County of Denver, the Downtown Denver Partnership, and the
Historical Commission.
Ms. Wood said yes but noted that RTD was also talking to the business
community, the general public, and people who work and live downtown.
Director Menten inquired as to which of the primary stakeholders wanted
granite pavers.
Ms. Vishwakarma said all three.
Director Menten asked whether RTD could use the $15 million for something
else, such as paying off debt, if the agency did not come to an agreement
on the environmental assessment.
Ms. Wood said no, and explained that the funds were awarded for the
rehabilitation of the mall and the transit way.
Mr. Van Meter commented that the scope was very clear and defined, and
RTD’s only alternative would be to return the grant funds.

• State Highway 119 Bus Rapid Transit
Mr. Van Meter stated that Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, would
present this item to the Board.
Mr. Quinn said that the intent of the State Highway (SH) 119 project was
to:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 3, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Wood explained that safety was a concern addressed in the
environmental assessment. She said that the new pavers would have a
different surface, but maintenance would be needed to keep them clean and
rough and added that the new pavers would have a completely different
texture and texturing process.

Director Anderson asked if the federal government had decided what
actually qualified for BRT funding.
Mr. Van Meter said yes and added that there was a definition for capital
investment grant programs. He said that for projects under $300 million
there was more flexibility and with this study those conditions could be met.
Director Sisk stated that he had attended several presentations where Mr.
Quinn presented at which the audience was less than welcoming. He said
that Mr. Quinn served RTD and its constituents well and noted that he
always stayed on point and continued to be assertive and factual.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if there would be an analysis of the cost
involved to add more bus service.
Mr. Quinn said yes, and noted that staff would be analyzing the additional
service hours for RTD as well.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if that would be considered an alternative.
Mr. Quinn stated that currently, RTD offers the BOLT and the J. He said that
the current discussion was to incorporate those two services into a new set
of services.
Committee Chair Lubow commented that she would like to see more public
input. She said that there was an issue with US36 and the P3’s and the big
elephant in the room is the Northwest Rail’s lack of completion. She added
that she was leery of going overboard and creating new service that would
make rail harder to get.

• Mobility Choice Blueprint
Brian Welch, Planning Technical Service Senior Manager, stated that this
would be the first of four presentations made to the Board. He stated that
one of the themes emerging from this project was the need for agencies to

transportation investments
 Pilot Projects with private sector partners and continued participation
of the business community
 Identifying potential for efficient technology-leveraged investments
Mr. Welch explained that currently, the blueprint status was:

Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, was going to be rolling
back emissions standards. She asked if there could be a consensus of what
that level of air quality should be for 2035 and suggested that should be the

driver for density on the different technologies that would be available to
transport people.
Director Menten whether Mr. Welch meant to imply that government
agencies would intervene with the public sector.
Mr. Welch commented that a better term would be “proactive”.

Mr. Welch remarked that he did not see it that way. He said that Mobility
Choice would find opportunities for partnership, but it would not tell people
how to design their cities or what they should or should not do. He said that
it was more of a proactive stance than reactive.
Director Walker commented that the week before he was at the American
Public Transportation Association’s (APTA) Legislative Conference and all of
the talk there centered on autonomous vehicles. He said that since then
there had been an accident in Arizona and another in California. He inquired
if those incidents changed the discussion about technology being used to
move people around.
Mr. Welch explained that this was part of the hype cycle. He said that some
technologies receive hype and great expectations, and sometimes that hype
is fulfilled and other times there is a downhill spiral and everyone is brought
back to reality. He stated that, in terms of autonomous vehicles, there are
significant challenges ahead.
Director Walker asked if Mr. Welch was familiar with the RoadX project.
Mr. Welch said yes, and commented that CDOT was looking at practical and
realistic technologies and stated that connected vehicle technology has a lot
of promise ahead.
Director Sisk stated that he was excited about the Mobility Choice Blueprint.
He said that it could be an amalgamation between the public and private
sectors. He added that Rick Pilgrim was in the audience, a top expert in the
nation and a member of the Mobility Choice Team. He said that he was
reassured that this was money well spent.
Director Anderson commented that the APTA Board of Directors was
currently looking at this very issue. She noted that all forms of
transportation were subsidized by some form of government, and how we
incorporate these new forms of technology is exciting and important.

Director Menten commented that either “intervene” or “proactive” could also
mean being disruptive to the private sector that might offer a better
alternative.

Director Catlin said that this topic had been a part of the national dialogue
for a number of years, and since it was a national dialogue, she would
caution against being so metro Denver focused. She said that it was
important to review the broader picture.

Mr. Welch noted that there would be forty project ambassadors to ensure
that there was an exhaustive and thorough public approach.
Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired if any youth councils were part of the
ambassador group and if there was anyone outside of the district
participating.
Mr. Welch stated that the youth council information would be provided to
the Board but noted there was not anyone outside of the district
participating.
Director Solano asked if other cities were contacted both nationally and
internationally.
Mr. Welch said yes.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if local universities had been contacted as
well.
Mr. Welch stated yes, and noted that there were multiple opportunities for
Mobility Choice to engage with the academic community on this study.
Committee Chair Lubow asked that the Board be apprised of upcoming
Mobility Choice events.

D. Other Matters
Chair Tisdale stated that he wanted to take a straw poll. He said that Ms. McKillop
had pulled together the opportunity for the Board to use the MyCard as
complementary passes instead of the paper passes that were normally distributed.
He noted that the MyCard would allow staff to monitor how many passes were
used and what types of rides were utilized. He commented that the system was
ready but he wanted input from the Board first. He remarked that each Board
member would still be allocated 15 passes a month, for a total of 180 each year,
and each MyCard pass would be pre-loaded with $9.00.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 3, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Lubow remarked that, while this was an exciting and
timely project, she was concerned with paying for this and wanted to ensure
there was enough public outreach so that the public was not left behind.

6.A

Ms. McKillop said that staff’s thought was that the $9.00 would get someone out
to the airport. She commented that the MyCard pass would work differently than
the current paper pass, which was only a one-way ticket. She noted that staff
intended to track the usage of the MyCards, which they could not do with the
paper passes.
Director Hoy stated that, with all of the controversy about giving away free rides
and cutting down on paper passes, this option would actually give away more rides
than the paper passes.

Director Solano asked if the MyCards could be reloaded.
Ms. McKillop said yes, and noted that if someone were to register their card, they
would also have money protection. She remarked that the instructions for
registering cards would be passed out with the cards.
Director Tisdale noted that there were three Directors that were a no, or in doubt
about the process, but the balance of the Directors were in favor.
Director Catlin explained that, since she was new, she had no comparison and that
was why she was unsure about the new proposed process.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no Recommended Actions.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL & Associates
Committee Chair Solano stated that Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, was
unable to attend the meeting and that the information he had provided was
included in the packet.

• State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK), reported
that the state budget, which had passed out of the House the previous week
and had made its way to the Senate, included $495 million for
transportation funding, $225 million in contributions to the Public Employees
Retirement Association (PERA), and $18 million in additional funding for
higher education. She said that the Joint Budget Committee (JBC) had also
set aside additional funding to account for Senate Bill 18-200, regarding
modifications to eliminate PERA’s unfunded liability, which was also working
its way through the legislative process. She noted that the JBC had
allocated $40 million, $20 million for each chamber, for bills stalled in the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees, but she stated that the
House had overspent their allotment. She said the General Assembly
regarded the $495 million as a one-time infusion for transportation.
Regarding Senate Bill 18-001, concerning transportation bonding, Ms.
Brandeberry reported that the bill passed out of the Senate unanimously
following an amendment from Senator Zenzinger, though she noted that the
House was contemplating a different approach to the bill. She also reported
that a companion bill to the state budget specified how the $495 million
transportation funding would be allocated, noting that the House had
specified a formula similar to that found in HB17-1242 and that the formula
was eventually stripped by the Senate. She stated the current form of the
Packet Pg. 24

Director Deadwyler participated via phone.

Ms. Brandeberry stated that RTD’s innovative financing methods were highly
regarded by the General Assembly. She also spoke about Senate Bill 18-204
(SB204) by Senator Tim Neville, which sought to bar RTD from creating any
additional discount fare programs. She said the testimony from Director Hoy
and Rolf Asphaug, RTD General Counsel, was spot on regarding the General
Assembly’s preemption of RTD’s fare programs. Though SB204 had passed
out of the Senate Finance Committee and was scheduled for second reading,
Ms. Brandeberry said she did not expect the bill to pass and said that
Senator Neville had made his point.
Director Broom asked whether the conference committee on the state
budget would be composed of members of the JBC, and Ms. Brandeberry
said that was correct.
Director Lubow asked how it came to be that the state suddenly had an
additional $495 million for transportation funding that was not required to be
refunded under the provisions of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights (TABOR).
Ms. Brandeberry said that the General Assembly had created an enterprise to
receive hospital provider fee payments from the federal government and
that, as a result, additional revenues were freed up in the state budget.
Director Lubow asked whether a similar situation could happen in 2019.
Ms. Brandeberry said it would depend on the budget forecast, though she
said that none of her colleagues expected a similar scenario would play out.
Director Lubow asked whether the Senate and House had different ideas on
how to spend the transportation money.
Ms. Brandeberry said that both chambers thought that transportation
spending was a priority. She stated that the reason the state had not been
successful in the past in receiving transportation funding was that the
stakeholders would fight about how to spend the money before they even
received it. She said that there were different philosophies on how the
money would flow but noted that there would be a lot of positioning before
the budget process was finished.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, said that the Directors who recently
attended the APTA Legislative Conference were rewarded by getting to see
good things happen in Washington, D.C. He noted that Congress had passed
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 3, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

bill would place the money into the Highway Users Tax Fund, but she noted
that a conference committee on the bill would likely need to be convened to
work out the differences between the two chambers.

an omnibus spending bill for 2018, which would allow RTD to receive the
final $63 million installment of the full funding grant agreement (FFTA) for
the Eagle P3 project. Regarding the reimbursement of the risk premium on
RTD’s Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan for the
Denver Union Station project, he said the federal government had narrowed
the criteria on how that premium would be paid back. He stated that RTD
had been grouped in a cohort with the Great Lakes Central Railroad
(GLCRR), which still owed $17 million on its own RRIF loan, and he noted
that RTD was the only entity to have paid back its loan in the history of the
program. Mr. Dino reported that the conference attendees had also spoken
with the congressional delegation about the President’s infrastructure
proposal, though he noted that the aide in charge of that program, D.J.
Gribbin, had recently resigned. He reported that Congress had approved
across-the-board budget increases for federal agencies, though the
President’s budget requested reductions for Transportation and Housing and
Urban Development.
Director Lubow asked whether the increased federal departmental funding
might translate into more money for unfunded corridors.
Mr. Dino said that would not be likely, given that there had not been any
significant changes made to the rules governing the award of transit project
funding. He said the transportation reauthorization would need to come first
before any changes in policy would take place.
Director Lubow asked whether it would be correct to say that rule changes
would be necessary to allow access to the increased funding in the
congressional budget.
Mr. Dino said that the capital investment program that funds transit
programs was itself funded, which he felt would bode well for the future. He
said that the President wanted to reduce capital investment grants for
transportation, though Congress did not agree. He added that the intention
of his firm was to go after as much transportation funding as possible,
though he said the rules would have to change to be more favorable for
investment. He said that, in a discussion with Congressman Polis, Chair
Tisdale said that, when RTD lobbied for money, the agency would like to
think that it was lobbying for the North West Rail Project.
Director Lubow asked how to get to the next step.
Mr. Dino said that a discussion needed to be had regarding possible
solutions. He stated that changing the rules to make things more flexible had
been a major challenge with agencies and Congress, since there was never
enough money to go around. He indicated that RTD had to have been
competitive just to receive the money it had already gotten. He said the

agency had lobbied previously just to keep things the way they were and
cited the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) as an example.
Director Lubow asked whether it was correct to say that the door was not
currently open for funding.

Chair Tisdale expressed his appreciation for Mr. Dino’s report and his
support in Washington, D.C. Regarding the credit risk premium, he said that
the $29 million would eventually be repaid with interest and asked which
interest rate would be applied.
Mr. Dino said that the question was asked in Washington, D.C., but not
answered.
Ms. McKillop said that the rate was not specified in law. She said the
agency was working with the Department of Transportation (USDOT), which
indicated there was never the anticipation that RRIF loan recipients would
ever pay back the loans. She said that RTD requested that the interest be
paid at least at the Treasury rate, and she indicated the interest period
would begin at the time the loan was repaid in 2017. She indicated that she
and Patty Doersch, from Squire Patton Boggs, had discussed how to
convince the other cohort participant, the GLCRR, to repay their loan.
Chair Tisdale said that a provision in state law prescribed that any rate of
interest not specified in a contract would be paid at the judgment rate of
interest by default, and he questioned whether a parallel provision might
exist at the federal level.
Mr. Dino replied that it should be determined whether the GLCRR, the other
participant in the cohort, intended to pay off its RRIF loan. He said it might
take longer for RTD to receive its money if there were to be a debate on the
applicable interest rate.
Committee Chair Solano asked whether a bill regarding vendor fees had been
introduced in the General Assembly.
Ms. Brandeberry said that a bill had been introduced in an interim committee
in 2017 and was subsequently rejected. She said that bill’s sponsor,
Representative Winter, did not intend to introduce another such bill in the
2018 regular legislative session.
Director Broom asked for a status update on a court case concerning certain
special districts’ ability to collect and retain marijuana taxes.

Mr. Dino said that it would be correct to say that the corridors were not

Mr. Asphaug said that the case was pending before the Colorado Supreme
Court. He said the court would soon decide whether RTD would need to
submit a ballot question in order to collect and retain marijuana taxes.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee- 2017 Annual Report
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, presented highlights from the
2017 annual report, which had not yet been released. She said that RTD
held an event in November 2017 celebrating the fact that the agency had
reached the $1 billion mark in projects awarded to disadvantaged business
enterprises and small business enterprises (DBE and SBE). She stated that
representatives from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) attended the
event and spoke highly of the program. She noted that a video on the
subject had been posted on the RTD website and that the story had been
featured in several publications across the nation, including the DBE
magazine. She said that a new committee, called the Advisory Committee
for People with Disabilities (APCD), was also established in 2017 with the
goal of partnering with the disabled community. She said the committee was
composed of 13 members, along with a steering committee of 11 members
made up of RTD senior managers. She noted that the agency’s equal
employment opportunity (EEO) program would begin to train all RTD
employees in the near future.
Chair Tisdale reiterated the fact that RTD had invested $1 billion in DBEs and
SBEs and noted that the official 2017 report would be forthcoming.
Director Folska said that $1 billion was a huge amount of money and that
the agency should be proud. She advised that persons with disabilities
should be part of the conversation and should be embraced.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of NewPush Contract for Hosting Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to award a contract for “Infrastructure as a
Service to Host Smart Media Technology and Ticket Vending Machine
Systems in a Payment Card Industry Secure Environment” with The
NewPush, LLC (NewPush) (Contract Number 17DH041) for an amount not to
exceed $4,000,000. The contract is for two base years with three one-year
options to extend the contract.
GENERAL MANAGER’S GOALS
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Asset Management/State of Good Repair
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the April 17, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, pointed out that the
contract would not exceed $4,000,000 for 5 years and would
be for two base years with three one-year options to extend.
Ms. McKillop stated that RTD had conducted an open
procurement for an offsite hosting contractor and that the
criteria for selection and the members of the evaluation team
were included in the packet. She explained that three firms
had submitted proposals Arisant, Dataman, and NewPush, and
that the members of the evaluation team unanimously selected

Directors Broom and Mihalik were absent.

6.D

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what the selected company
would bring to RTD to secure the data of our customers.
Ms. McKillop explained that the company had the most solid
security protection plan, was PCI certified and they offered
monitoring services.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that she did not know if the PCI
standard would protect RTD customers from a security
breach.
Ms. McKillop stated that PCI was the merchant card industry
standard to protect customer data as it pertained to credit card
and other client data.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that she was not convinced that
standard compliance was enough to protect RTD customers,
and would vote no until she had additional information
regarding NewPush’s qualifications.
Chair Tisdale clarified that the contract amount of
$612,036/year in hosting costs plus $187,964/year in
contingency funding equaled a $800,000/year. He stated that
the contractor should bring a higher level of service than RTD
could provide if RTD supported the system in-house.
Ms. McKillop explained that RTD conducted an analysis that
determined that it was much more cost effective to have the
hosting vendor provide all of the hardware, upgrades to
hardware, and equipment replacement. She added that
through the vendor RTD would always have the most up to
date and state of the art equipment.

Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

NewPush as the successful proposer. Ms. McKillop explained
that the funding provided for $612,036/year in hosting costs
and included $187,964/year in contingency that would be
used to expand the amount of traffic and hosting capabilities
and to possibly add monitoring services. She added that RTD
did not have the resources to support the system in-house and
continuously meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards,
which would put the Smart Card system and RTD at additional
risk. Ms. McKillop stated that, if the contingency funds were
not used, they would be returned to the unrestricted fund
balance.

Wobbekind from the University of Colorado Boulder Leeds School of
Business to present the RTD Sales and Use Tax forecast. He stated that RTD
used the forecast for the Mid-Term Plan, the Long Range Plan, and the
Annual Budget.
Mr. Wobbekind summarized the background information from the forecast

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for an explanation on how aging people in the
community have affected the economy when there was so much growth in
Colorado.
Mr. Wobbekind explained that there were far fewer people that could

people from moving because they don’t have to move to find a job.

Mr. McNown explained that with the current situation that had driven
Colorado’s unemployment rate down, there was not enough prime age
workers available.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why ethnicity was not considered when
analyzing unemployment rates.
Mr. Wobbekind explained that the information was available at the national
level.
Director Williams asked how RTD’s 2016-2024 Revenue correlated to the
projected cost of living increase and how would RTD adjust to the cost of
living impacting ridership.
Mr. McNown stated that the project was to forecast sales tax revenue and
not ridership.
Director Anderson asked if the forecast had factored in any future volatility
or was the forecast straight sales tax.
Mr. McNown explained that the forecast would not be correct and that there
would be changes that would influence the forecast.
Director Lubow stated that she was particularly interested in cash flow
projections and asked if the changes from the past years that would forecast
RTD with a significant cash flow increase.
Mr. McNown stated that there were not major revisions in the forecast and
were similar to the forecast from six months ago.
Director Walker asked if a median annual pay was forecasted.
Mr. Wobbekind stated that the median annual income could be done by
industry but the state did not provide that data and the median piece could
not be forecasted by itself.

Director Sisk stated that Boulder announced a $4 million shortfall in taxes
collected and asked if RTD should be concerned with a shortfall occurring in
the district.
Mr. Wobbekind explained that Boulder was atypical and was suffering from
competition and the redistribution of taxes to neighboring cities. He added
that there had been a dramatic movement away from goods and people
were buying more services that did not have a tax.

Mr. McNown explained that was not specifically included in the model but
the tariff that was implemented tended to be slow in acting. He added that if
the tariff was implemented tomorrow it would take more than six months to
show impact.
Mr. Wobbekind stated the Moody’s forecast would be taking those changes
into effect.
Chair Tisdale said that he appreciated the detail that was provided in the
report. He added that RTD had to develop a budget that used the research
provided.
Director Menten stated that ridership was not factored in and shared an
article that described empty buses and packed freeways. She added that she
would send the article.
Mr. McNown stated that he would be very interested in the article.
Ms. McKillop explained that the sales tax forecasting project did not include
ridership and that RTD did that forecasting internally.
Director Menten stated that she mentioned the article to point out the
possible changes ahead in RTD’s future.

• Wells Fargo Banking Contract Update
Ms. McKillop stated that a few months ago the RTD banking relationship
with Wells Fargo was discussed and the Board requested an update
regarding the contract. Ms. McKillop introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager
of Debt and Investments, to explain the contract.
Mr. Morgan stated that the information included in the Board packet was to
provide background information about the RTD and Wells Fargo banking
relationship, the current status of the contract, and the potential paths

Mr. Morgan stated that the current RTD/Wells Fargo Contract would expire
on September 30, 2018, and RTD had an option for a 6-month extension.
He added that RTD would need to decide whether to proceed with its own
competitive procurement process, or coordinate with other governments and
participate in their procurement process. Mr. Morgan explained that in the
past RTD had piggybacked on State of Colorado’s Request For Proposal
(RFP) process in order to benefit from the larger organizations ability to
obtain lower pricing. He explained that, if RTD decided not to piggyback on
the State RFP, the path forward would include beginning the RTD
competitive procurement process that would take a minimum of six months
and that it was possible that the pricing obtained could be less attractive
than what may be available through working collaboratively with other local
governments. Mr. Morgan explained that, if the District were to change
commercial banks, either through a collaborative RFP or a stand-alone RFP,
an extended period of system modifications and implementation would be
required along with the maintenance of parallel processes for some period of
time prior to a “go live” with the new financial institution. He added that this
implementation and transition would necessitate an increase in staff and

forward. He added that the Board was aware that Wells Fargo had been
involved in a scandal resulting in the assessment of major fines. Mr. Morgan
explained that RTD worked with the commercial side of the bank and had
not been directly impacted by the scandals. He stated that Wells Fargo had
been RTD’s commercial bank since 2004 and had performed the following
services:

substantial costs that would not be expected to be recovered through
competition.
Director Anderson expressed that she really appreciated the presentation and
that it brought into perspective what a bank needed to provide to RTD. She
added that it appeared as though RTD got a great deal for the services that
Well Fargo provided.

Director Lubow asked how much it would cost RTD to switch commercial
banks.
Ms. McKillop stated that because RTD had piggybacked on the state and
had not done its own RFP so there was not enough data to make a price
comparison. She stated that there was an opportunity of cost savings by
pooling with the State. And explained that regardless of how RTD choose to
issue the RFP there was a possibility that the agency might not change
banks. She added that this was unlike a normal change in vendors and
stated that it would be time consuming and costly to pursue both paths and
pointed out that it was not an easy process to switch banks.
Director Lubow stated that she found what happened with Wells Fargo
shocking and added that she did not believe that Wells Fargo could have
contained the issue in one area of the bank. Director Lubow asked if there
were investigative reports about banks to assist RTD in making the decision.
Ms. McKillop stated RTD would take a banks reputation and performance
into consideration when moving forward with the RFP process.
Director Williams asked Ms. McKillop what she would like to do for the RFP
process.
Ms. McKillop explained that the contract was up and that she was leaning
towards piggybacking on the State RFP, but RTD would need an extension
of the current contract regardless of which way was decided.
Director Catlin echoed Director Folska’s and Lubow’s concerns about what it
would cost to pursue any kind of change.
Ms. McKillop explained that she would analyze the cost difference and
provide that information. She stated that either way RTD would have to eat
the cost of a transition because the contract was up.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated she was interested in trying all avenues in
order to acquire the best banking for RTD, but was more interested in the
cost of shifting banks.

6.D

Director Catlin stated that she was somewhat skeptical of statewide
initiatives and asked if RTD would take a back seat to the state RFP.
Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would receive the same benefits and rates
as the state.

Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would be going to an RFP regardless even
if the decision was to piggyback on the state.
Director Walker stated that there would be times that the agency would
have to change a bank and that many banks have had nefarious actions. He
added that he trusted Ms. McKillop’s decision.
Director Solano agreed with Director Sisk that RTD should not become
complacent and the RFP was a good thing.
Chair Tisdale stated that it would be appropriate and the most beneficial to
remain with Wells Fargo for the six month extension and to piggyback on
the State RFP. He added that RTD would not have to follow the state
decision but could find the best deal for the agency. Chair Tisdale stated
that the Board and agency owes it to the constituents to find the best deal.
Director Hoy asked, if RTD pooled with the state, whether RTD could decide
not to use the chosen bank if RTD did not like the procurement.
Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would not have to use the state procured
bank.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if the bank had to be an American bank and if
RTD could have its own bank.
Ms. McKillop stated that the statute required that the district bank must be a
state regulated financial institution and must be federally regulated and
insured. She added that it could be in the district or outside of the district.
Director Menten stated that she had a fondness for credit unions because
she felt they treated customers better, and she disliked huge state or
national banks. She added that she would like to go to a new financial
institution.
Director Williams asked if RTD had a credit union, or if it could be one.
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Sisk stated that RTD employees currently receive banking benefits
from Wells Fargo and therefore RTD was affected by the scandals. He
expressed concern that RTD was dependent and deeply involved with Wells
Fargo and that the agency could not end the banking contract.

6.D

Ms. McKillop stated that she did not believe setting up a credit union would
be in RTD’s best interest or promote RTD core values.
Director Hoy stated that credit unions behave like banks and that there may
be a local credit union that could meet RTD banking needs.

Director Anderson called point of order, stating that the discussion had
become off topic.

C. Updates

• Board Report August 2018 Service Changes Committee
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, said that staff had developed a
network of improved delivery options and that staff would continue to adjust
services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance as
a whole. He explained that the entire service change process takes three to
four months to finalize and staff would host seven public meetings before
the next service changes are proposed. He added that this discussion would
cover the human resource elements as they pertain to the service change
process.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, explained that
staff was attempting to align services to match RTD’s available manpower.
He noted that currently, RTD was short 144 full-time and 30 part-time bus
operators. He stated that it was staff’s collective desire to reach the right
level of service that paralleled RTD’s manpower to reach equilibrium. He
added that RTD would also hold off on allowing municipalities, such as
Boulder, to buy-up service until RTD reached its service service/manpower
balance.
Jessie Carter, Service Planning and Scheduling Manager, stated that staff
was looking to affect the overall service hours. He said that this proposal
had a number of service adjustments which included Conifer/Evergreen as
well as a restructuring of the 27.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that with respect to the 27, it made sense to cut
the route in two. She asked how the area that would not be served would
be connected to the system.

Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired as to what would happen when equilibrium
was finally achieved. She asked whether staff would keep the status quo or
continue to aggressively recruit operators.
Mr. Abel explained that staff’s intent to align service was only an interim
strategy. He said that the best way to describe the process was that, as
service comes down, the headcount increases, which would eventually meet
in the middle, then both would then grow together concurrently.
Director Folska, Ph.D., remarked that the worst case scenario would be that
service, when ridership increases, is not adjusted appropriately. She asked
for more information on the Colorado School for the Blind.
Mr. Carter explained that in 2012, when the route 401 revision was
proposed which is what the route 85 is now, the Colorado Center for the
Blind protested that change. He said that, since that time, the school’s
housing had moved and was now served by a different route.
Director Catlin asked if there would be any modifications to the proposal
after public input.
Mr. Abel said yes and remarked that RTD wanted to engage the public to
provide their feedback.
Director Caitlin stated that during her Telephone Town Hall, there were a
few comments that pertained to the Evergreen/Conifer service and she
wanted to make sure staff received those comments.
Mr. Abel commented that the restructuring is attempting to improve service
from the Federal Center Station to the city core.
Director Sisk said that, in respect to the City of Boulder’s offer to buy-up
service, if RTD did not accept that money, other districts would suffer. He
noted that this was going to be something that RTD needed to get in front
of and would be a difficult task. He added that it was not a forever plan and
Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Cater explained that staff wanted to take this proposal out to the public
to determine if there were other ways to provide service and access. He said
that routes 26 and 27 lend themselves to further adjustment and could
potentially be restructured in the future. He added that, if ridership continued
to grow, staff would provide additional service to right-size.

it would be re-evaluated and noted that he was satisfied that this was the
correct approach.
Director Menten noted that she was going to host her own Town Hall
meeting the following Sunday and asked if the service change brochure
would be ready.

Director Lubow commented that RTD’s service change process was a
backwards way of doing things.
Mr. Carter explained that the first service change meeting would be held on
May 29th and the last was scheduled for June 7th. He indicated that the next
service change proposal would be presented to the Board in June for
implementation in August.
Director Archuleta asked staff how many operators the agency still needed.
Mr. Abel stated that, for both bus and rail, RTD was short 202 positions.
Director Archuleta inquired as to how many people were in the training
classes at the moment.
Mr. Abel said that RTD held classes every other Monday. He said that for
the previous week 12 people were expected to attend but only 9 showed
up. He added that staff was also not in the position to advertise recruitment
efforts until the Board approved the new Collective Bargaining Agreement.
He noted, as the Leeds School of Business had previously highlighted, that
there were only 0.5 unemployed people for every position available.
Director Walker commented that anyone who had been here long enough
would know that nothing was set in stone and all routes were fluid. He
asked what this meant for mandating.
Mr. Abel explained that it would be an improvement on RTD’s need to
mandate. He said that, if RTD could improve its headcount, it would lessen
that burden as well.
Director Walker remarked that he had been asked for Saturday service for
the 27. He asked if the reduction would help facilitate that addition.
Mr. Carter said that it could. He noted that the route 27 would become a
shorter route and staff could shape the service to where it was needed.

Director Williams said that the gentlemen at the table have stepped up to the
plate time and time again and she commented staff for the marvelous job
they do with the minimum number of employees RTD has.

Mr. Abel said that staff will discuss with General Counsel what RTD could or
could not do.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that it was criminal under the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) guidelines but suggested that RTD’s buses do not
operate under them. She added that RTD needed to stand behind its
employees and that any type of assault was unacceptable.

• Transit Priority Update
Mr. Abel said that staff wanted to provide the Board with a quick update
regarding
identifying
opportunities
to
improve
service
through
implementation of transit priority strategies. He noted that RTD needed to
focus its efforts on utilizing its existing resources for items such as traffic
signal priorities and queue jumps.
Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, stated that the Transit
Priority Study Goals:
 Identified and prioritized corridors for transit priorities
 Transit priorities would:
• Increase bus service speeds and reduce bus delay
• Improve bus service reliability
• Improve customer satisfaction
• Lead to increased ridership and cost-effectiveness
 Support community investment in sustainable mobility through
interagency coordination: Complete Streets, transit, bicycle, and
pedestrian
Mr. Becker noted that in terms of RTD’s bus network:
 All RTD bus routes were broken down into 40,000 segments for
detailed study
 Multi-step screening was used to identify and prioritize corridors that
would best benefit from transit enhancements based on:
• Speed - measure of delay and reliability
• Passenger load – benefit the most customers
Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that the biggest problem in terms of
recruitment was that operators face a rude public. She noted the drivers
who spoke in front of the Board who said they had been spit on by bus
riders, and added that recently, another driver was called racial epithets a
couple of times. She said that RTD needed to assure its operators that any
kind of assault was met with a zero tolerance policy and a strong stance
needed to be taken.

6.E

Mr. Becker stated that in terms of speed:
 Actual running times were used to estimate speed at segment level
 Median speed was 17 MPH
 Slower speeds in places were as expected

Mr. Becker commented that in terms of the index score:
 Captures areas with slowest speeds and highest loads (based on
median values)
 Clusters of high scoring areas
 Corridors such Colfax and Broadway
 Use index score to identify short list of corridors
Mr. Becker noted that the top 15% of segments:
 Were the first level of screening
 Were where the corridors started to take shape
 Were the building blocks for the network
Mr. Becker stated that for corridor continuity, it was important to:
 Identify continuous corridors
 Synergy with current service performance
 Bottom-up analysis
 Downtown focus
Mr. Becker remarked that priority corridors would:
 Adjust alignments to complement radial and grid network
 Some already being addressed, e.g., E Colfax,
Speer/Leetsdale
 Narrow priorities with city input
o Downing St.
o E 17th and 18th Avenues
o E 12th Ave.
o Federal Blvd
o W Colfax Ave.

 Federal Blvd. & Alameda Ave.
 Federal Blvd. & 29th Ave.
 Federal Blvd. & US-6 westbound off ramp

 Federal Blvd. & 10th Ave.
 Federal Blvd. & Exposition Ave.
 Federal Blvd. & W. Virginia Ave.
 Federal Blvd. & Evans Ave.
 Federal Blvd. & Mississippi Ave.
Mr. Becker explained that the Federal Blvd. priority bus stops included:
 15 priority stops
o 10 meet both ridership and delay thresholds
o 4 meet delay threshold only
o 1 meets ridership threshold only
Mr. Becker said that Federal Blvd analysis assumptions had:
 120 second cycle length
 20 seconds of additional green time due to TSP
o 10 seconds early green
o 10 seconds extended green
 G/C improves by 0.17
 Delay reduction expected: 10 – 15 seconds*
o 12 seconds assumed per intersection
 17 TSP intersections = 204 second delay reduction
Mr. Becker noted that Federal Blvd. proposed northbound improvement
benefits and tradeoffs included:
 TSP
o Bus service reliability improves
 Minor increases to vehicular travel times on side streets

Mr. Abel stated that it was important to determine how RTD could get as
many big bangs as it could for its limited dollars while making strategic
investments with low impacts.
Director Anderson commented that she had just attended a presentation
from a one person department at the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) who was working on this exact same issue. She said that it is not
lost on her that Federal Blvd., Sheridan Blvd., and Wadsworth Blvd. were all
state highways. She noted that if RTD could work with other municipalities
to get this done she would be very appreciative. She added that this had
been a topic of conversation in her city for the past couple of weeks, and in
fact, some people in her district have wanted to have bus stops removed
because they make them nervous. She also added that a lot of people do not
know how to recognize, or understand the yield sign on the back of the
buses.
Director Williams said that Denver Street Partners had posted an interesting
statistic that outlined Federal Blvd. as the number one corridor for pedestrian
fatalities.

Mr. Abel confirmed that RTD was engaged in that process and added that
Federal Blvd. was a high priority for RTD and the City and County of Denver.

Mr. Abel explained that staff always has that consideration in their work and
added that the age old question in transit planning is how do we find the
balance and tradeoff between maximizing ridership and providing service to
everyone within the district, and how does that balance create good
business and mobility sense.
Mr. Becker noted that while the discussion is centered on one segment, it
affects every route from the outside in, and it is a systemic plan.
Director Solano inquired if staff had considered using roundabouts.
Mr. Becker explained that roundabouts were more of a traffic technique and
not a transit technique.
Director Walker said that this was similar to a process that Houston METRO
went through before they reconfigured their bus system a few years ago.
Mr. Becker explained that Houston METRO was looking at using this process
for their entire system and not for rightsizing service like RTD was doing.
Director Walker commented that, now that RTD had completed a large part
of its build out, the agency could focus on other areas of its service.
Director Catlin asked if staff was looking for ways to partner with local
municipalities to leverage funds.
Mr. Becker commented that RTD had not identified any funds, but various
cities already had.

• Potential Adjustment to Fixed-Route Contractor Agreements
Mr. Abel commented that RTD contracts out 45% of its fixed route services.
He said that RTD had contracts with First Transit and Transdev and they
operated under four separate contracts. He noted that historically private
contractor operators had been paid $1.00 less per hour than the starting
wage for RTD operators. He added that, since RTD and the Amalgamated
Transit Union (ATU) 1001 re-negotiated its collective bargaining agreement
(CBA) in February, it was recommended that RTD adjust and amend the
Packet Pg. 53

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow stated that while this prioritization process was smart and
made a lot of sense, she said that staff had forgotten the equitable issue.
She noted that the report did not mention anything in her district and her
constituents felt like they subsidize Denver.

6.E

Committee Chair Deadwyler asked what staff was proposing in terms of the
new contracted operator wage.
Mr. Abel explained that staff wanted to amend the current contracts to be in
line with the historical difference in wages, which was $1.50 to $2.00 less
than RTD operators.
Director Solano remarked that, while this was a good move forward, the
contractor operator pay wage should be comparable to RTD operator wage
pay and there should not be a difference between the two.
Director Folska inquired as to when the contractor agreements would be
renewed.
Mr. Abel explained that RTD had four contracts that expire on a rolling basis.
He noted that RTD was in the process of preparing the documents for the
re-procurement of Group 24, First Transit Commerce City. He added that
staff may be able to shorten the rebidding cycle, but it would have to be
done one contract at a time.
Committee Chair Deadwyler asked if all of the contractor operators were
represented by a union.
Mr. Abel stated that First Transit was represented by ATU 1001, which was
the same union that represents RTD’s employees, and Transdev was
represented by a different ATU group.
Committee Chair Deadwyler noted the recent CBA negotiations with ATU
1001 and inquired as to how RTD could come up with wages for the
contracted operators without participating in negotiations.
Mr. Abel explained that RTD would not get involved in the collective
bargaining process between contractors and their collective bargaining units,
but RTD believes it was appropriate to enter into the conversations with its
Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 10, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

existing agreements with First Transit and Transdev so that private
contractor operator wages could be increased to a more competitive amount
relative to the new starting wage for RTD operators. Mr. Abel added that the
amendments would include language, which stated that any funding
adjustments would be applied to operator wages and other ancillary benefits
and not to overhead, administrative costs, or profit. Mr. Abel commented
that the estimated costs would be $4.5 to $5.5 million in 2018 and $6 to
$6.5 million in future years. He noted that the purpose of the discussion was
to socialize the concept to the Board, and staff anticipated bringing forth an
action for Board consideration in May.

6.E

contractors to allow them to then go and have talks with their collective
bargaining units.

• Service Availability Update
Mr. Abel commented that the report was included in the packet and he
would be happy to answer any questions.
Committee Chair Deadwyler noted there were no questions and moved on to
other matters.

Mr. Abel thanked the Board members who attended the employee appreciation
barbeques and said that it meant a lot to staff and represented employees to see
the Board members at the events.
Director Lubow said that she had received an email from a disgruntled constituent
about the Bolt service from Longmont to Boulder. She commented that it was
distressing to receive letters like that and, while she understood it was because of
operator shortage, RTD’s constituents were being oppressed by lack of service. She
added that she was working with staff to provide better notifications for RTD’s
ridership.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated that Next Ride
clearly shows which trips are missed but conceded that it was a passive process
and noted that the current system would not accommodate a manual override. He
commented that a new system would come online at the end of the year and it
should take care of the current issues and be more flexible.
Director Menten stated that she receives the internal rider alerts first thing in the
morning and asked if the advanced notice to riders was provided two hours in
advance.
Mr. Abel explained that staff was always attempting to fill any route that needed to
be filled. He said that the dispatchers were always attempting to pull loop extras,
an extra bus in waiting for a particular route to fill voids, which meant a delay in
communicating information to the public.
Director Menten commented that, if the new alert system would not be rolled out
until the end of the year, she would look for a suitable alternative even it that
meant sending out a mass email or text herself. She noted that the 20 and 28 have
had problems and she would like to see routes with the biggest issues included on
the drop run hours report. She also inquired as to the ridership on the R Line.
Mr. Carter stated that ridership was averaging about 6,400 boardings per day,
about half of the 12,000 that was estimated.

Other Matters
Chair Tisdale spoke about the Board’s video recording project, which was nearing
its go live date. He indicated the current meeting minutes would be streamlined as
a result of the implementation of the video project. He indicated that the Board had
selected a vendor to provide closed captioning of meeting videos, along with
transcripts available in electronic format. He reviewed sample copies of the
transcript along with examples of the streamlined minutes format. He stated these
documents would be available with the along with the video recording. He said that
the question has come up regarding whether the video recordings could be
reviewed at high speed, and he said that the recordings would be exportable files,
though the files themselves would not be made available on the Board website.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, stated that the video
recordings would be available to the public starting via the Board website starting
with the June 2018 meeting cycle. She said that, also starting in June, the meeting
packets would be sent out by the close of business on Thursdays, rather than
Friday afternoons.
Chair Tisdale noted that the ability to deliver the meeting packets on Thursday was
made possible by the change in the approach to the minutes described earlier. He
said that transcribing minutes in a shorter time frame for inclusion into the packet
would have placed a significant burden on staff. He reiterated that the streamlined
process of creating annotated abbreviated minutes, along with the public’s ability to
access the entire meeting via video recording, allowed staff time to distribute the
packet on Thursday afternoons.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether the meetings would be captioned in real
time.
Ms. McManus responded that the captioning would be done after the fact.
Director Folska, Ph.D. asked where the public would be able to see the videos
recordings.
Ms. McManus explained the process, wherein staff would retrieve the video
recording for a given media, send it to the closed captioning vendor, download the
captioning and transcript files after they are prepared, and revise the files as
necessary before uploading the finished product for public consumption. She said
that the Meeting Portal would be the repository for the video recordings and
transcripts, whereas the portal only hosted agendas and minutes previously.

6.F

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked when the captioned video recordings would be
available to the public.

Ms. McManus noted that, because the meetings were being streamlined, the cost
of captioning the meetings would likely fall within the amount budgeted for closed
captioning service, which was $20,000 per year. She said the cost of hiring a
videographer to record meetings on a weekly basis would still need to be
determined.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether the video recording would only take place in
the Boardroom at 1660 Blake Street in Denver.
Ms. McManus replied that the Board Conference Room, the room in which
Executive Committee meetings are held, was also equipped with recording
equipment.
Chair Tisdale said that the current meeting was being recorded and indicated that
staff had been recording meetings for some time, but only for testing purposes and
not for public consumption.
Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that her television show used closed captioning, and
she said the captioning for a 30-minute show was turned around in 24 hours.
Mr. McKay reiterated that the captioning for meetings of the Board could be
expedited, but he stated that each jump in turnaround time was accompanied by
increased costs.
Director Menten asked the budget for the project.
Ms. McManus said that the closed captioning budget was $20,000 and that the
videography budget would depend on the response to the request for quotations
(RFQ) currently underway.
General Manager Genova added that the recording system was integrated with
existing resources and was user-friendly and that the finished product was
compliant with ADA and other accessibility guidelines. He noted that the cost of

Packet Pg. 59

John McKay, Board Office Administrator, explained that the entire process would
take about one calendar week, largely predicated by the turnaround time of the
closed captioning transcription process. He said that the captioning could be
prepared at an expedited rate, but also at a significantly higher cost.

6.F

live captioning made its implementation unfeasible at present but noted that
advances in software could lower the barrier to entry in the future.
Director Folska, Ph.D., replied that the licensing cost of captioning software was
relatively low.

General Manager Genova said that other agencies do offer live captioning but said
that RTD was held to high accessibility standards.
Ms. McManus added that RTD had its own rigorous internal accessibility standards.
Chair Tisdale said it would be good to find information on whether the City of
Denver offers real-time captioning, and if so, what product do they use and at what
cost. He suggested that the Colorado Municipal League (CML) might have helpful
information on the subject.
Ms. McManus said that, at the beginning of the project, staff reviewed several
options and found that many of the vendors would have required RTD to overhaul
its infrastructure in order to provide recording capabilities. She said that RTD’s
Safety, Security, and Asset Management Department provided the cameras an
infrastructure necessary to get the project off the ground; otherwise the costs
would have been substantially more.
Chair Tisdale said that it was well advised to be cost-effective in the transportation
industry and suggested that the prices of live captioning would undoubtedly come
down.
General Manager Genova noted that the accuracy of certain captioning options left
much to be desired.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether automated captioning and transcription
would make the jobs of the Board Office staff easier.
Ms. McManus replied that things would only be different. She said that, with the
shift to Thursday packet delivery, it would open the possibility of staff having fourday work weeks.

Director Lubow asked whether other government agencies offer live captioning and
how they are able to do so.

6.F

Director Lubow reiterated that, for the sake of comparison, the Board should review
what video accessibility options the City of Denver was employing.

Ms. McManus added that she had experienced a similar shift in the technology
landscape during the procurement of the Board’s agendas and minutes and voting
software. She said that, when the agency went out for quotes in 2010, IQM2 was
the only company whose bid met with the Board’s existing budget, and she noted
that IQM2 had subsequently been purchased by larger companies. She said that the
current company had honored the contracted service rates of the previous company
and cautioned that future costs may be high due to the lack of competition in that
segment of the marketplace. Ms. McManus also gave an update on spouse/family
ID badges for RTD employees and Directors. She said that in the past Directors
were not able to give passes to certain non-nuclear family members, but she
announced that a change in policy would open the eligibility to other family
members, including parents and life partners. She said that further details would
follow. She stated that the spouses of Directors or retirees would be the only
persons eligible to keep the passes indefinitely, with some conditions.
Director Lubow asked who made such decisions.
Ms. McManus said this was a human resources (HR) decision
General Manager Genova said the change could have been suggested by the
internal benefits committee but noted that changes in the realm of HR allowing
greater flexibility were driven by changes in law.
Chair Tisdale gave an update on the summary report from the joint Board/SLT
Strategic Planning retreat in March 2018. He said that the report could be
considered final, since he had not received any additional comments on the draft
report. He also stated that a report regarding an overview of FasTracks would be
forthcoming, with a target date of April 30 for an internal version of the report. He
noted that he was also working on synthesizing disparate guidelines compiled over
the years regarding the conduct of Board meetings, which he would present in a
draft summary to the Executive Committee before the final guidelines would be
submitted to the Board for final approval.

Chair Tisdale stated that the information regarding Denver’s video accessibility
would be useful, and he said that his sense was that Denver paid top dollar for
accurate expedited service.

6.F

Directors Menten and Lubow inquired as to the guidelines to which Chair Tisdale
was referring.
Chair Tisdale said that the Board had previously adopted various individual codes of
conduct for the Board Meetings, and he said he was seeking common ground on
how to proceed to combine those guidelines.

Ms. McManus responded that they would be distributed.
Chair Tisdale said that the draft of the combined document would be sent out as
well.
Director Menten said that there had been discussion among the Directors that the
meetings were too long, with an underlying message that Directors should not ask
too many questions. She said it was her hope was to have as much discussion as
each Director’s district deserves from their representatives.
Chair Tisdale said that he had not heard any complaints stating that Directors asked
too many questions. He said that he had previously asked Directors to explain their
no votes on recommended actions because he felt it was important to know their
reasoning. He said the goal of streamlining meetings was to respect everyone’s
time and intelligence. He stated that, by asking the presenters to relay only
pertinent new information not already included in the packets, the Directors would
have more time to ask questions.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said she agreed with Director Menten that Directors
complained about others’ asking too many questions. She said she felt it important
that Directors be given the chance to ask relevant questions rather than being
allowed to go off on tangents. She agreed with Chair Tisdale that the staff had
gotten better about condensing their presentations.
Chair Tisdale said that the job of the Chair was to appropriately and sensitively
allow conversation to go on as long it is fruitful but to close it when it becomes
redundant.
Director Deadwyler stated that she had previously complained about meetings being
too long. She said that what she saw as the Directors tendency to one-up each
other to prove their intelligence needed to be stopped.

Director Folska, Ph.D., suggested the Directors were getting better at that.

Director Lubow said that Director Menten and she had been reviewing the General
Manager’s performance goals. She said that the narrative document outlining the
goals was too wordy and stated her preference for the corresponding table.
Ms. McManus said that the GMOC moved to the table the previous year.
Director Lubow said that she found a previous form to be more helpful but stated
that it was no longer available.
Ms. McManus said that the form was not gone and stated that the GMOC never
populated the General Manager’s accomplishments using that table. She said the
table could be reproduced and added that the detail memorandum that was
provided in 2017 was less wordy than the previous narrative document but
provided more bullet points that were never detailed in the table.
Director Menten said she agreed with Director Lubow but suggested that the
discussion could take place elsewhere.
Ms. McManus said that the chart could be made to look however the Directors
wanted.
Director Menten asked whether Director Lubow would receive notifications and
packets for the GMOC even though she was not a member.
Ms. McManus confirmed that she would receive them.
Chair Tisdale said that all Directors were allowed to audit the GMOC though voting
was limited.
Director Menten said that Chair Tisdale had mentioned changing the process
regarding the recommendation of committee relative to the discretionary

Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tisdale, regarding the General Manager Oversight and Performance Review
Committee (GMOC), said that he was working with Directors Walker and Menten to
come up with a more streamlined and consistent description of the committee’s
role and function. He said that he had a copy of the 2010 resolution that created
the GMOC and said that it contained language that was inconsistent both within
the document and with the General Manager’s contract. He stated that he wanted
to set aside time to look for a better and more workable articulation of those things.

6.F

Chair Tisdale said that it was agreed that the GMOC’s role was to address the
oversight and performance review of the General Manager. He clarified that the
committee’s function was not simply to handle the General Manager’s job
evaluation, though that may be the committee’s principal function. He said that, in
the event of a health issue or other circumstances, the GMOC would address the
matter and provide guidance to the Board. He added that the discretionary
performance payout available under contract was a decision item of the Board as a
whole, not one set by the GMOC exclusively. He said that problem in the past had
been that the committee’s decision regarding the amount of the discretionary
performance payout had previously been viewed as a final decision, when the
decision should have been made by the full Board.
Director Menten said that was the process when the GMOC was formed in 2010,
but she said the process had since changed.
General Manager Genova said that the committee currently functioned as it did
since the implementation of new procedures and that the committee put forth on
action to address both the performance evaluation and the discretionary
performance payout. He noted that the Board had two committees that did not act
as committees of the whole, the Executive Committee and the GMOC.
Director Lubow asked whether the recommended action was included in the Board
packet.
General Manager Genova recalled that it was included.
Ms. McManus said that there was a process change along the way. She recalled
one instance in which the recommended action was sent to another committee
before being approved by the full Board. She added that, for the previous three
years, the members had been invited by the Executive Committee to participate in
the discussion of the approval for the recommended action but said that Directors
outside of the Executive Committee had not shown up.
Chair Tisdale said that the current changes were being made so as to look and feel
better to the entirety of the Board. He said he had the opportunity to put Directors
on the committee who were able to see that change.

Packet Pg. 64

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

performance payout, so that the entire Board would determine the amount rather
than the GMOC.

6.F

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that those Directors who were not members of the
Executive Committee were not allowed to vote until the recommended action
reached the full Board.
Ms. McManus responded that was correct, but she added that Directors were
invited to speak during the Executive Committee.

Chair Tisdale said that the optics had been addressed to make the GMOC function
better.
Director Deadwyler said that she had been on the Board since 2011 and had served
on the GMOC. She said that in years past it did not matter whether Directors
attended the final committee meeting, because the decision had already been made
at that point. She suggested that Directors attend the last three GMOC meetings in
order to come to agreement with committee members.
Ms. McManus said the Directors would receive the GMOC agendas and
supplementary materials and would be alerted when the General Manager presented
his accomplishments.
Director Lubow agreed.
Chair Tisdale said it would behoove him to do personal outreach as well, since the
General Manager’s performance review was one of the Board’s most important
discussions.
General Manager Genova stated that two topics would be discussed during the
April 24th Study Session, the General Manager’s tactical goals for 2019 and a
detailed update on the Pass Program Working Group recommendations.
Chair Tisdale reported that he, along with Director Solano, Sherry Ellebracht, RTD
Government Relations Officer, and Jenifer Brandeberry from Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs (BBMK), had met with state Senator Tim Neville regarding his Senate
Bill18-204. He said the bill would prohibit RTD from instituting discount fare
programs without legislative approval, and he noted that the discussion with
Senator Neville centered around RTD’s farebox recovery. He said that the group
would need to have a follow-up meeting to discuss a memo released that same day
by Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of

Packet Pg. 65

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that her comments were not appreciated when she
attended in years past.

6.F

Chair Tisdale also reported that the same RTD representatives who visited Senator
Neville had also met with Representative Faith Winter in response to a letter sent to
the RTD on behalf of most of the members of the House Democratic Caucus
regarding the progress of the review of the PPWG recommendations. Chair Tisdale
said that the review and possible implementation of PPWG recommendations was
an ongoing process for which there would be vigorous discussion.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what Senator Neville was hoping to learn in their
meeting.
Chair Tisdale said that his only question was about farebox recovery.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for an explanation of the essence of bill.
Chair Tisdale suggested that it was something Senator Neville thought might be a
benefit to RTD. He said the bill would impose a limitation on RTD’s ability to create
a discount program without legislative approval.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether Senator Neville wanted RTD to consult with
the General Assembly regarding fares.
Chair Tisdale said that Senator Neville had specific ask.
General Manager Genova said that the point of the bill would be to prevent RTD
from creating a discount program without prior legislative approval.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether the General Assembly would pay for a
discount program if they approved it.
Chair Tisdale suggested that they may have never intended to approve such a
discount.
Director Lubow asked about the typical farebox recovery rate.

Packet Pg. 66

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Finance and Administration. He said that memo gave a full breakout of RTD’s
farebox recovery ratios and described how RTD met with statutory recovery
requirements. He stated that, based on the raw numbers, it would appear that RTD
collected less than the 30% of farebox revenues required by law, but accounting
for certain factors, the agency actually recaptured close to 45%. He said that he
wanted Senator Neville to know that RTD was listening to his concerns.

6.F

General Manager Genova said that there were two different measures to define
farebox recovery and that the memo being prepared by Ms. McKillop would
illustrate the differences.
Chair Tisdale said he had received questions regarding the industry standard
recovery rate.

Chair Tisdale said that the rate would be zero for organizations that do not collect
fares from passengers.
Director Menten said that Senator Neville saw that there was pressure on the RTD
Board. She noted that the farebox recovery rate was approved by the General
Assembly in 1989, based on concerns that RTD may have been receiving a large
portion of transportation funding and taking funds away from other areas. She said
she had questions about some of the figures described by the memo being prepared
and was glad that certain things were being defined.
Chair Tisdale said that he was waiting on an email from Ms. Brandeberry regarding
a follow-up meeting.
Director Lubow asked whether RTD could do anything to make Senator Neville pull
his bill.
Chair Tisdale noted that 2018 was an election year and said that representatives
want to make their constituents aware that they tried to accomplish certain goals.
He said that he was fine with the bill if it did no harm but would step in otherwise.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that sometimes the harm was seen after the fact.
Director Menten said that she would be personally recording the April 24th Study
Session.
Chair Tisdale said that he had no hesitation with that and stated that the meetings
needed to be public.
Director Deadwyler said she had no comments on the PPWG but would like more
information. She said she hoped the April 24th Study Session would be recorded as
Director Sisk suggested.

Packet Pg. 67

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova commented that the typical rate varies based on an
organization’s operations, fare structure, and other factors.

6.F

Director Menten said she could do it for less than $10,000.
General Manager Genova said that was the cost of production videos rather than
regular meeting recordings.

Director Menten said she was interested in discussing alerts for users of MyRide.
General Manager Genova said that the Next Ride utility on the RTD website gave
either real-time or scheduled bus arrivals, based on whether the buses on the routes
shown were equipped with locator devices. He said that staff would prepare some
information on this. He noted that, as had been discussed during the meeting on
Tuesday night, RTD dispatch was constantly trying to fill dropped routes, and it
was his desire not to have to any dropped routes. He said the notifications
mentioned by Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, would
take place through means other than the Next Ride utility.
Director Lubow said she was told that the Next Ride utility would display canceled
runs.
General Manager Genova said that he would have to follow up on that.
Director Menten asked whether information could be sent to constituents.
General Manager Genova responded that the agency should do a better job of
teaching people to use existing technology.
Chair Tisdale said that he had tried to use the Next Ride utility and commented that
he must be less adept than he though, because he could use transit applications
(apps) without issue.
General Manager noted that many of the existing transit apps were not created
RTD and stated that staff would also provide information on those apps as well. He
said he was hoping to send some information to the Board via his memo the
following day.
Director Lubow asked whether the enhanced rider alerts might be available by the
end of 2018.

Packet Pg. 68

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 12, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tisdale said that the meeting would be recorded but noted that meeting
videos would not be put out for public consumption until the June meeting cycle.

6.F

General Manager Genova said he would have to circle back with Mr. Reed.
Director Lubow replied that she would like to be able to follow up with her
constituents. She said that, if RTD cannot provide the constituents with rides, the
agency should at least give them notifications.

Chair Tisdale confessed that he understood constituents’ frustration when using
certain transit tools.
Director Menten said that she did not know to look for the Wi-Fi symbol on the
route maps, which indicated that a bus on a given route was transmitting real-time
location data.
Director Folska, Ph.D., suggested that a tutorial be given in a future study session.
General Manager Genova noted that a demonstration had been presented previously
but said another could be arranged.

Mr. Barnes stated that for 25 years he had been a member of a great family and that RTD
was a great place to work. He added that he began his career at RTD as a temporary
employee and ended up staying for 25 years. Mr. Barnes thanked all of his friends and
employees with RTD.
Henry Stopplecamp introduced Mr. William Ferares and stated that it has been a pleasure
working with Mr. Ferares over the past 26 years. He added that Mr. Ferares had been
responsible for maintaining facilities all over the district.
Mr. Ferares thanked his team, especially Ron Posey and Robin McIntosh, for all the
support to make his position a success over the years.
General Manager Genova introduced Mr. Terry Emmons, stating that Mr. Emmons had
been an incredible value to the Senior Management Team and a tireless contributor who
was well respected by his peers. He added that Mr. Emmons was always on duty,
prepared, ready to go, and ready to meet any challenge. General Manager Genova stated
that Mr. Emmons was a man of faith, character, integrity, and a great friend. General
Manager Genova detailed the many positions that Mr. Emmons had during his 35 years at
RTD, which included bus mechanic, bus operations and training instructor, light rail
operations supervisor, senior manager of rail operations, and finally as the Assistant
General Manager of Rail Operations. He added that Mr. Emmons had been included in
every rail expansion project that RTD has built and he was also in the inaugural MultiAgency Exchange program and was graduate of Leadership Academy program. General
Manager Genova stated that upon retirement Mr. Emmons was going to spend time with
his family, camp, fish, golf, travel, and have fun. He thanked Mr. Emmons for all he had
done for the community and the agency.
Mr. Emmons thanked General Manager Genova for his kind words and the Board for his
acknowledgement. He added that RTD was a big family and that he would miss all the
great talented people that he had met and worked with over the past 35 years. Mr.
Emmons stated that RTD had many great leaders that have mentored him and helped him
through his career. He thanked RTD for all the opportunities and all the people that had
inspired him.
Chair Tisdale recognized Dispatcher Vicki Vafeades-St. Croix for her 29 years of service to
RTD.

Packet Pg. 73

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 27, 2018 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 27, 2018)

and had worked behind the scenes on every FasTracks project. Mr. Stopplecamp thanked
Mr. Barnes for being a great asset to RTD.

8.A

Public Participation
Chair Tisdale stated that the public participation period was open to anyone who wanted
to speak. He explained that elected officials were invited to speak first, and others would
be called in the order they signed up, and then additional speakers would be invited at the
end of the list. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes
and to approach the lectern when called and state their name and address. Chair Tisdale
asked that if any speaker had documentation or reference materials for the Board to give
those materials to the Board staff prior to speaking.
Christopher Zvolenek, Arvada, through a sign language interpreter stated that he was at
the Board meeting to bring concerns to the Board regarding a bus accident that happened
on March 22, 2018. He stated that the operator was reckless resulting in his being injured.
Mr. Zvolenek explained that the operator was distracted and had to brake at the last
minute at a red light where he was then struck by the bus. He added that there had been a
communication barrier since the incident with the RTD Risk Management department. Mr.
Zvolenek explained that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) stated that reasonable
accommodations must be made and that the Department of Justice stated that agencies
such as RTD had a responsibility to respond. He added that he had provided a copy of all
of the documentation regarding the incident, that RTD should take accountability and bring
the issue to resolution, and that he hoped for a response from RTD Risk Management.
Diane Bomar, Denver, diane.bomar@comcast.net, requested that members of the Board
contact her regarding the issue that she would be unable to address in three minutes. She
explained that she had 40 years of experience volunteering with paratransit organizations,
along with professional experience in software engineering and user interface design, and
she personally had used adaptive equipment specifically for the visually impaired. She
stated and that she had served on the paratransit advisory committee for RTD for the past
four years. Ms. Bomar commended RTD staff and the RTD paratransit staff for their
commitment to doing the right thing and their sense of equality. She added that she had
only good things to say about Larry Buter, RTD Paratransit Manager. Ms. Bomar explained
that she had concerns regarding the recently signed contract with RouteMatch, a
scheduling software vendor for paratransit, because the software did not have access for
the visually impaired.
Jeff Su, Lakewood, explained the he was the Executive Director of Mile High Connects, a
broad partnership of organizations from the private, public, and nonprofit sectors that
commit to increasing access to housing choices, good jobs, quality schools, and essential
services via public transit. He stated that he had attended the Pass Program Working
Group (PPWG) meetings and that it was a consensus among the PPWG to invest in a lowincome pass and a youth pass. Mr. Su stated that he wanted to correct a public narrative
that said that the PPWG had recommended a fare increase to offset the potential revenue

Kristen Siedel, Denver, expressed concerns on behalf of the Denver Women’s
Collaborative over the recent press release regarding the PPWG. She stated that the Board
of Directors were elected to operate a public transportation system and to represent the
public. Ms. Siedel stated that passes such as the proposed low-income and youth pass
would serve the variety of people that rely on public transportation. She added that the
low income pass assists organizations in providing services to help women and families
better their lives. Ms. Siedel requested that the Board serve the public that they were
elected to represent.
Gary Van Dorn, Denver, reported that the braille signage at Civic Center Plaza had been
corrected and installed. He added that in the future he hoped RTD would work with the
disability community regarding signage. Mr. Van Dorn stated that an issue had been
identified with the Call-n-Ride service. He explained that customers could make a
reservation but could not change it. He said the Job Access With Speech (JAWS) screen
reader was difficult to use with Smart Card Services and the Voiceover screen reader did
not work at all. Mr. Van Dorn stated he would be forwarding information regarding the
issue in writing to the Board and General Manager Genova.
Lindsey Fietz, Denver, on behalf of The Gathering Place, stated that there were many
organizations concerned about the next steps in the PPWG Process and that the Board and
staff take into consideration the PPWG recommendations. She added that the time and the
care that went into the recommendations from the PPWG was impressive and she hoped
the Board would take the recommendations seriously. Ms. Fietz stated that The Gathering
Place endorsed the PPWG recommendations and encouraged the Board to consider raising
the pass low income discounted price to 50% off the regular priced fare.
Matt Samelson, Denver, on behalf of the Donnell Kay Foundation, which works on K-12
public policy issues in Colorado, specifically on improving transportation mobility for youth
stated that a youth pass would provide many benefits to youth, such as getting to school,
libraries, and employment. He encouraged the staff to reach out to the wealth of
knowledge across the district and agencies that had youth pass programs to assist in
implementing a positive program for youth.
Stacy Johns, Denver, stated that as a PPWG attendee she was excited about RTD
implementing a program for youth that would assist making Denver Public School (DPS) a
choice school system. She added that that she encouraged RTD to work with the city and

Packet Pg. 75

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 27, 2018 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 27, 2018)

loss of a low-income and youth pass program and that approach was not discussed or
recommended by the PPWG. He added that would be seen in the written PPWG
recommendations. Mr. Su requested that the RTD Board and staff take a problem solving
approach during the examination and implementation of the PPWG recommendations.

8.A

Phoebe Amoco, Denver, stated that she was a 9th grader, that she considered attending
school far from her home in order to obtain a better education, and that her only means of
transportation would be a RTD bus, and that cost prohibited her from attending. She
added that many students did not receive the education they wanted or needed due to
transportation issues. Ms. Amoco stated that reducing the amount of money students use
for transportation would be beneficial and hoped that all students would have access to
RTD buses. She asked the Board to support the recommendations from the PPWG.
Jessica Aggray, Denver, stated that transportation issues limited students’ ability to
participate in the DPS SchoolChoice process and attend the school that best matched their
needs. She encouraged the Board to support students and youth in transit equity.
Jennifer Aggray, Denver, stated that if all students had access to RTD passes that she and
other students would be able to apply through the DPS SchoolChoice program to attend
better schools. She asked the Board to vote in support of the recommended youth pass
program.
Jenee Donelson, Denver, stated that, as the Transit Organizer for 9to5 Colorado and a
leader of the Rock Mountain Bus Riders Union, she worked to provide equitable change in
the transit system. She thanked the members of the PPWG who came together to
revitalize a failing fare structure. Ms. Donelson explained that the PPWG was asked to
estimate costs without full knowledge of RTD budget and to remain revenue neutral an
incredibly stressful undertaking while juggling the public’s money. She added that Heather
McKillop, RTD CFO, attended the last meeting, which gave the meeting a non-neutral
atmosphere. Ms. Donelson stated the PPWG recommended implementing a low-income
pass at a 40% discount. She urged RTD staff and the Board to implement the low-income
pass at a 50% discount. Ms. Donelson stated that a 40% discount would not benefit any
low-income recipient if fares continue to increase past affordability. She stated that a
discount was not a hand out and that the people that the Board members represent need
an income-based bus pass at a 50% discount. Ms. Donelson said that the public outcry
was prevalent at every RTD Board meeting and urged the Board to approve the lowincome pass.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, stated that she worked for 9to5 Colorado as the Housing
Organizer and was there to read testimony from Reagan Bird. She read the letter that
stated that Ms. Bird was a transit-dependent rider for over 15 years, was a former

Packet Pg. 76

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 27, 2018 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 27, 2018)

DPS to move the pass program forward. Ms. Johns asked the Board and the staff to listen
to the students and to involve the public in the decision pass program making process.
She added that the public’s eyes were on the RTD Board and the public trusts that the
Board would listen to the needs of the public.

8.A

Felipe Vieyra, Denver, stated that he worked with Together Colorado and would share
testimony from Ben Chavez. He stated that Mr. Chavez was the coordinator for a reentry
program for justice-impacted youth aged 18–24 that assisted with employment, training
programs, education recovery, and GED or high school diploma programs. He added that
the program had limited resources for transportation due to the purchase cap on non-profit
organizations. The testimony stated that the program needed income-based passes
because most clients were transit dependent and urged the Board to approve the income
based pass program recommended by the PPWG.
Chair Tisdale thanked all those who participated.

Chair's Report
Chair Tisdale stated he would share a summary of the most pertinent events on the
horizon, as well as other items the Board members should be made aware. Chair Tisdale
provided the following highlights:




Directors Anderson, Folska, Solano, Walker and the Chair were all in Washington,
D.C. the previous week for the American Public Transportation Authority (APTA)
Legislative Conference, which provided an opportunity for Directors and members
of Senior Leadership Team to meet with members of our Colorado delegation in
order to provide an update to legislators and their staff, to meet with committee
staff of crucial committees, and to meet in person with the leadership of the
Department of Transportation, particularly K. Jane Williams, Acting Administrator
of Federal Transportation Authority (FTA). Chair Tisdale stated that the Directors
and staff requested that the Omnibus Bill include $63 million for the last installment
of Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) and for the refund of $26 million from the
credit risk premium on borrowed funds that RTD had paid back 21 years ahead of
schedule.
Monday, March 26: Directors Solano and Folska kicked off the telephone town hall
series. Chair Tisdale explained that each of the Directors, working with CRL
Associates, would participate in a collaborative town hall session in which more
than 30,000 constituents in each Director District would have the opportunity to
provide feedback on RTD’s services. He added that the scheduled dates and times
were posted on the RTD website.

Wednesday, March 28: Chair Tisdale stated that he and the RTD General Manager
Dave Genova would attend the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
Commissioners’ Deliberation Meeting regarding the RTD appeal and the hearing held
the previous month.
Chair Tisdale stated that the Board members were provided a copy of an undated
letter from two dozen members of the Colorado House of Representatives regarding
a request that the RTD Board provide an update on the timing and direction of the
PPWG’s recommendations. He asked for the Board’s consent to respond to the
letter by stating that the PPWG had submitted twelve recommendations to RTD
Senior Leadership Team (SLT) for evaluation, that the SLT had started the
evaluation, and that the results would be presented to the Board when completed.
He added that after the evaluation was presented that the Board would comment
on the PPWG recommendations. Chair Tisdale explained that a response before the
SLT evaluation and recommendation would subvert the process and jeopardize the
years’ worth of work by the PPWG. He added that he would explain that, with the
Board’s consent, RTD would commit to keeping the representatives informed of the
progress. Chair Tisdale stated that, unless there was objection, the discussed
response would be issued to the representatives

General Manager's Report
Chair Tisdale asked General Manager Genova to share his report.
General Manager Genova highlighted the following:
 FTA Acting Administrator, K. Jane Williams, visited to tour the University of
Colorado A Line, several other projects, and participated in a round table.
 APTA Legislative Conference was productive and beneficial to RTD with the
meetings with the House and Senate Committee.
 General Manager Genova presented at the APTA National Press Conference
conveying the RTD story of FasTracks, P3s, Denver Union Station, the benefits of
transit including mobility and economic development, and the continued need for
federal funding to address growth and to keep U.S. cities moving, viable, healthy
and competitive.
 RTD provided an update to the FTA on the Eagle Project, especially the schedule on
the G Line.
 The Omnibus Funding Bill had been signed and the request that RTD had made for
the remainder of the Eagle Full Funding Grant was included and there was also
some language included to address how to pay back the credit risk premium.
 The South East Rail Extension tie in, while it impacted the lines, was a success
with a huge the amount of work completed in 9 days. General Manager Genova
thanked all of the municipalities and agencies involved that made the challenges of
shut down run smoothly.

Wednesday, March 28, 2018, the CPUC deliberation meeting would be held that
RTD would attend to listen and observe, and would report to the Board the
outcome of the meeting.

Director Sisk stated that the Board appreciated and listened to the public comments,
however, he would never condone public comments to disparage or take our staff to task.
He added that he respected Heather McKillop, Chief Finance Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance, for all the work she has done for RTD and said she was a valuable
member of the staff. Director Sisk stated that the public should address the directors as
elected officials not the RTD staff that worked tirelessly and considered all pieces for the
agency.
Director Menten asked what the responses were from the federal aide and elected
representatives regarding the $27 million credit risk premium.
General Manager Genova explained that staff members on committees, such as Senate
Banking and House Transportation and Infrastructure, are supportive and in agreement that
RTD had paid back the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan and
that the collateral needed and should be paid back. He added that the committees are
working on the mechanisms to create a process to return those funds.
Chair Tisdale stated that each member of the RTD delegation, the Senators and the
Congressmen, had pledged to work to with RTD to resolve the RRIF loan issue.

Discussion:

Director Menten stated that she would be a no vote because
of the included pension agreement and that she did not feel
that the employees had not been asked to contribute enough
to the pension program. She added that there are many
employers that did not provide a pension and employees
should be required to contribute more to a pension. Director
Menten stated that it would take decades to fund the pension
program and that she would not support the agreement.
Director Lubow stated that she would be a yes vote because
RTD needed to make an attractive benefit and payroll package
in order to hire more employees and maintain service.
Director Solano stated that 89% of the union agreed and
voted to ratify the agreement. He added that senior leadership
did an extraordinary job creating the agreement and that he
would be a yes vote.
Chair Tisdale congratulated the team especially Mike Meader,
Chief Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety,
Security and Asset Management, for all the hard work to
reach an agreement.
Mihalik stated he would be a no vote because without
incrementally addressing the pension issue in three years
pension plan would be that much more difficult to implement.
Anderson stated that she though it was a good package and
appreciated the staff and the union for working together to
negotiate the agreement. She added that she would be an
absolute yes vote.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that she would be a yes vote.
She added that she valued RTD employees for their hard work.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that RTD asked employees to do
work for the district that was above and beyond what many
companies request especially the ongoing mandating of
overtime. She added that it was time for the Board to support
the employees.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

March 28, 2018

Subject:

RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District E and Director District G so that
all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls within Director District E, which has a lower
population than District G.
This recommendation addresses General Manager 2018 Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management:
Oversees operating and FasTracks budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal reporting,
and development of financing plans for future projects.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012, in accordance with CRS 32-9-111(1)(a), the Board approved a revised Director
District map to reflect changes in the District’s population as reflected in the 2010 Census. Per CRS 329-111(1)(a), individual Director Districts must be comprised of whole general election precincts, as
established by the boards of county commissioners of those counties wholly or partially within the
district and by the election commission of the City and County of Denver and the City and County of
Broomfield. CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) also requires that “the fifteen directors will represent, to the extent
practical, the people of the district on the basis of population”. While the statute does not provide
specific population requirements, the Board Redistricting Committee established a threshold of five
percent deviation from the average Director District population. At the time of redistricting, the
population of District E was 173,503 while the population of District G was 179,331. The mean
Director District population was 177,847.
From time to time, the individual counties adjust precinct boundaries. Usually, the adjusted precincts
remain completely within individual Director Districts; however, Arapahoe County has adjusted its
precincts so that Precinct Number 234, all of which was previously in Director District G (Director
Mihalik), now falls across the boundary of District G into District E (Director Folska). See attached map.
While a majority of the precinct’s land area lies within District G, a majority of the precinct’s population
is within District E. Furthermore, given uneven growth rates since the 2010 Census, the estimated
population of District G is now approximately 10,000 greater than that of District E (District G: 210,290
vs. District E: 200,470). The precinct in question straddles I-25 in the vicinity of Arapahoe Road. In
order to change the Director District boundaries, the Board must take action.
DISCUSSION
CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) states the following: “No general election precinct may be split into two or more
director districts.” Arapahoe County’s new precinct map places Precinct Number 234 over the boundary
of District E (Director Folska) and District G (Director Mihalik). In order to conform to statute, the Board
must adjust the Director District boundaries so that the new precinct lies exclusively in one Director
District.

Packet Pg. 86

11.A

If the Director District boundaries were adjusted to include all of Precinct Number 234 into District E
(already the smaller of the two Districts in question), the population of that Director District’s population
would increase by approximately 570. If the precinct were instead assigned to District G (the larger of
the two Districts in question), that District District’s population would increase by approximately 1,370,
which would make for an even larger population gap between the two districts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District E
and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls within Director
District E, which has a lower population than District G.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors and do not approve the revised Director District boundary between
Director District E and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 234 falls
within Director District E, which has a lower population than District G. Instead, the Board could
expand Director District G to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 234, which would expand
that Director District’s population by approximately 570.

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 16 FO-017 Contract Amendment #2

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend Contract 16 FO-017 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $2,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
Contract amount of $2,603,096.91. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding
for this Contract will be included in the individual approved project budgets.
This Recommended Action supports two of the General Manager’s 2018 goals. 1- Core Goal #1 Successful Delivery of Transit Services. 2 - Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
This Board Action is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit in the Contract. All other terms and
conditions of the Contract remain unchanged. Services rendered under this Contract provide mechanical,
civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and landscaping, design and engineering services for the
development of selected projects included in RTD's SBP Program and grant funded projects. The
Contract duration was specified for a three year term from November 01, 2016 to November 01, 2019
with award being in the amount of $453,096.91. To date one Amendment in the amount of $150,000
has been added to the Contract for a current not-to-exceed value of $603,096.91 Allowable, are two,
one-year extensions to the Contract. Exercising the two, one-year extensions brings the duration of the
contract to November 01, 2021.
DISCUSSION
Consultant responsibilities include preparation of drawings and specifications, in addition to estimating
and other construction related services as defined in their original Scope of Work. The purpose of this
Contract Amendment is to assist the Capital Programs Department with design services that cannot be
completed with in-house staff. To date, six Work Orders have been written for a total value of
$574,074. The additional $2,000,000 is an estimated value anticipated for the design support needed
for stand up of the North Metro Operations, system wide civil improvements, and facility renovations
including mechanical, electrical, and tenant finishes across the District.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal for this contract is set at 10%. To date, the consultant is at 22.3%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This Contract utilizes grant and local funds. The type of funds are dependent upon the funding source of
each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded from the budgets of the projects where the
work will be performed.

proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract with a
new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on all 2018
projects requiring these services.

Construction Award for IFB 37-DE 001. East
Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls
Upgrade Project

General

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical Inc. in the
amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. It is
further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to transfer $551,222 from
the Base System Contingency funds to the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade
Project. Funding for the contract and the transfer are included in the 2018 budget.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
The East Metro maintenance and storage facility was constructed in 1979 - 1980 and opened for
operations in September of 1980. The facility is approximately 351,000 square feet and is comprised of
bus maintenance, bus storage, administrative offices and driver support areas.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s East Metro Facility has a total of 17 Supply Air Units (SAU) on the roof that serve the
maintenance and bus storage areas. Four (4) SAUs were replaced in October 1986 by Colorado Piping &
Mechanical and are to be replaced under the scope of this project due to the structural integrity of the
units, availability of parts and issues with maintainability. Six (6) SAUs were replaced in 1995 by AMI
Mechanical, Inc. and remain in good condition with some repair work scheduled to be completed under
the scope of this project. Seven (7) SAUs were replaced by JCOR Mechanical Inc. in 2010 and are in
very good condition. An outside air intake hood is being provided for each of these units as part of this
project to improve the integrity and longevity of the air filters in the SAUs. Two (2) existing air handling
units (AHU) serving the south Drivers End / Administration area are 25 years old and are to be replaced
under the scope of this project due to the condition of the units, availability of parts and issues with
maintainability. The East Metro Facility existing Building Automation System (BAS) is 25 to 38 years old
and has become inefficient and unmaintainable due to the availability of replacement parts. It is to be
replaced under the scope of this project. The bus maintenance tailpipe exhaust system is also to be
replaced under the scope of this project to better control bus tailpipe exhaust air rates and improve
energy efficiency.
BID OUTCOME
The Invitation For Bid (IFB) was advertised on January 31, 2018. Bids were received and opened on
March 6, 2018. Due to the great demand for this type of work in the Denver construction market, both
the bids exceeded the approved budget. After reviewing the Scope of Work and the bids, the low bid
has been deemed appropriate. The two bidders are proposed in the following manner.

$3,334,000

SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was 5%. JCOR Mechanical Inc., being a certified SBE contractor, will have the capacity to
exceed the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All funding is local and is in the approved 2018 Budget. In order to award the project to the lowest
bidder, JCOR Mechanical, Inc., we need to transfer $551,222 from the Base System Contingency Fund
into the approved budgeted line item. Over the past year there has been unprecedented price increases
that are affecting the local building industry.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical
Inc. in the amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls
Upgrade Project. It is further recommended that the General Manager or his designee be
authorized to transfer $551,222 from the Base System Contingency funds to the East Metro
HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. Funding for the contract and the
transfer are included in the 2018 Budget.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to JCOR Mechanical Inc. in the amount of $2,840,224 for the East Metro
HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project. Further, do not recommend that the
General Manager or his designee be authorized to transfer $551,222 from the General Manager’s
contingency funds to the East Metro HVAC and Building Automation Controls Upgrade Project.
The project shall be reduced in scope and re-advertised. Reducing the scope of the project will
not keep pace with the long-term State of Good Repair Goals required for the East Metro Facility.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
pass the attached Property Acquisition Resolution certifying property as necessary for the construction
of the North Metro Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process
under state eminent domain law. Funding of this acquisition is included in the 2018 Adopted Budget for
the North Metro Project.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals - Core Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the North Metro Commuter Rail
Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs have been
identified and specific legal descriptions prepared and all acquisitions certified by the Board by
Resolutions in September 2011, June 2013, March 2014 and March 2016 have been acquired. An
additional property interest has been identified by the contractor as required for construction of the
North Metro Commuter Rail Project
DISCUSSION
State and Federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has the power of eminent domain. RTD staff and
its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offer and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceedings to resolve property acquisitions. The attached Resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorized the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this right of way acquisition is included in the 2018 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
project.

Approval of NewPush Contract for Hosting

Board Meeting Date: April 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for “Infrastructure as a Service to Host Smart Media Technology and Ticket Vending Machine Systems in
a Payment Card Industry Secure Environment” with The NewPush, LLC (NewPush) (Contract Number
17DH041) for an amount not to exceed $4,000,000. The contract is for two base years with three oneyear options to extend the contract.
GENERAL MANAGER’S GOALS
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
The Smart Media Technology (SMT), Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) and website are all hosted at an
offsite facility to provide additional Information Technology (IT) security to these systems for RTD.
Doing so requires a considerable set of IT infrastructure to be deployed and operational. These systems
require a highly complex Data Center with special attention to security, high-availability,
communications, continuation of operations / disaster recovery, etc.
More specifically the hosting, systems and subsystems must:
1. Meet and maintain Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.
2. Provide protected high network security standards because of stored customer information.
3. Provide high availability and 24/7 support because if the system were to be down, it would be a
major inconvenience for riders and there would likely be a loss of revenue.
4. Provide regular system backups
RTD currently contracts for these hosting services and has for the past three (3) years. RTD currently
pays approximately $340,000/ year for these services. The $340,000/ year is lower than the new
proposed contract amount because RTD purchased the hardware ($341,798) when we went to a hosted
environment. That hardware has reached its useful life and will be surplused. It has been determined
that it is much more cost effective to have the hosting vendor provide all of the hardware, upgrades to
hardware, and replacement, thus the increased annual cost for this contract.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for an offsite hosting contractor. Four firms submitted proposals.
One of these proposals was rejected as non-responsive. The responsive proposers were: Arisant,
Dataman, and NewPush. The criteria used to evaluate the proposals were:

There were four members of the evaluation team representing, procurement, IT system administration,
electronic fare operations, ITS systems administration, and an IT enterprise architect. The four members
of the evaluation team unanimously selected NewPush as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $4,000,000 for 5 years. This funding provides for $612,036/
year in hosting costs plus $187,964/ year in contingency funding. Funding for 2018 is included in the
2018 Budget with future year funding planned in the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract for “Infrastructure as a Service to Host Smart Media Technology and Ticket Vending
Machine Systems in a Payment Card Industry Secure Environment” with The NewPush, LLC
(NewPush) (Contract Number 17DH041) for an amount not to exceed $4,000,000. The
contract is for two base years with three one-year options to extend the contract.
2. Migrate the system back to RTD and provide security and support for the system in-house. RTD
does not have the resources to adequately support the system 24/7 and continuously meet PCI
standards. This would put the Smart Card system and RTD at additional risk.
