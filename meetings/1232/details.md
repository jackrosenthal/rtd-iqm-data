#### 1. Federal Center TOD Pilot Resolution

Bill Sirois greeted the Board and reviewed the history of the Federal Center TOD Pilot Resolution.  Mr. Sirois explained that RTD initiated a process with the City of Lakewood (Lakewood) and General Services Administration (GSA) back in 2010 with a goal of looking at a comprehensive development plan that would include RTD property at the Federal Center as well as GSA property which GSA intended to dispose of for private development. The area under consideration is the area north of RTD’s platform.

Mr. Sirois reported that the City of Lakewood has always intended to buy this GSA property and they are currently in the process of negotiating terms.  The City of Lakewood would like to release a solicitation for a master developer.  Staff has worked extensively with Lakewood for almost a year on this solicitation and will also be a part of the selection process.  This Resolution offers a way for RTD to show our commitment to the project for Lakewood and the development community. Some of the highlights do include the TOC concept and pilot program.  Mr. Sirois shared that any development deal negotiated would be brought before the Board for final approval. The Board was not currently voting on a development deal but rather voting on the concept of moving forward with getting a solicitation for a master developer.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 26th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Folska inquired if there was a master developer in mind.  Bill Sirois shared there have been discussions with developers but that staff does not have a specific developer in mind. Staff wants to go through RTD’s procurement process to get the best candidate for the vision that both the City of Lakewood and RTD have for the specific area.

Director Folska asked for clarification from Mr. Sirois when he previously talked about federal monies. She questioned if he was referring to FTA funds.  Mr. Sirois confirmed that was correct.

Director Folska noted that she does not have a problem with the term TOC other than she thinks it should refer to pedestrian oriented communities and would like the Board to consider that moving forward.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option - Farnsworth Group

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a two-year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing boundary mapping contract through 2015 in an amount not to exceed $70,900 in 2014 and $72,700 for 2015 which would make the total contract amount, including past year amounts, $438,700.

Motion:              Director Folska make the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 26th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Bill Van Meter reviewed with the Board that in late 2009, RTD selected the Farnsworth Group to provide boundary mapping services.   As articulated in the Board Report, some of the key things the Farnsworth Group does are keep track of RTD’s district boundaries to determine who should pay for parking and RTD sales and use tax and with any redistricting or annexations.  Staff has found Farnsworth Group to be very responsive, effective, and they were the lowest/best value bidder at the time of their initial solicitation.  Staff recommends that the Board approve exercising their 4th/5th option years; after those years RTD would need to re-bid but staff is very pleased with their services to date.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
