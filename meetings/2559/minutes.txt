I.

Call to Order
Chair Tobiassen called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m.

II.

Pledge of Allegiance
Director Lasater shared a commentary by Red Skelton regarding the Pledge of Allegiance.
From The Red Skelton Hour, CBS TV, January 14, 1969, COPYRIGHT 1969 Richard Red
Skelton
I: me, an individual, a committee of one.
PLEDGE: dedicate all of my worldly goods to give without self-pity.
ALLEGIANCE: my love and my devotion.
TO THE FLAG: our standard, Old Glory, a symbol of freedom. Wherever she waves, there
is respect because your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts freedom is everybody's
job.
OF THE UNITED: that means that we have all come together.
STATES: individual communities that have united into 48 great states.
Forty-eight individual communities with pride and dignity and purpose, all divided with
imaginary boundaries yet united to a common purpose, and that's love for country.
OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC: a state in which sovereign power is vested in
representatives chosen by the people to govern. And government is the people and it's
from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the people.
FOR WHICH IT STANDS ONE NATION: meaning, so blessed by God.
INDIVISIBLE: incapable of being divided.
WITH LIBERTY: which is freedom, the right of power to live one's own life without
threats, fear, or some sort of retaliation.
AND JUSTICE: the principle or quality of dealing fairly with others.
FOR ALL: which means, boys and girls, it's as much your country as it is mine.

Since I was a small boy, two states have been added to our country and two words have
been added to the Pledge of Allegiance: UNDER GOD
Wouldn't it be a pity if someone said, "That is a prayer," and that would be eliminated
from schools, too?
Chair Tobiassen asked everyone to stand and join him in the Pledge of Allegiance.

Whereas Chair Tobiassen and Directors Bagley, James and Lasater served faithfully and
dutifully on the Board as advocates for providing Public Transit that offers safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the district; and
Whereas each Director has served with distinction on multiple internal and external
committees during their tenure always acting in the best interest of RTD and it’s

Now, therefore be it resolved by the RTD Board of Directors
That we, the Board of Directors, hereby extend our heartiest commendation to Chair

V.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 JM Fay expressed her concerns about RTD not publicizing fare increases,
specifically in regards to a coupon she was able to obtain at King Soopers that
allowed her to get a local daily pass for $1.30. But since December, the coupon
has been denied by two different drivers. Each coupon saves the rider
approximately $0.12/trip. Ms. Fay is also upset about the fare increases,
temporary stops for no reason, connection issues pointedly between routes 73 to
21 and 73 to 11 and 73 to 6. She is apprehensive about the increase of fares and
decrease in services, with no reimbursement for when busses don’t come.

VI.



Jamie Lewis, Transit Advisor for both Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC)
and Denver Regional Mobility and Access Council (DRMAC) stated that last year,
two representatives from CCDC spoke to state legislators about the inadequacies
with the Access-A-Ride program and State legislators suggested that RTD work
closely with CCDC regarding their concerns. Mr. Lewis expressed his excitement
regarding the upcoming Access-A-Ride audit and he emphasized the thorough audit
of the timeliness of the rides and hopes that the latest technology is used to
schedule rides so riders do not have to wait on hold to schedule a ride. Mr. Lewis
also stated that since the Access-A-Ride drivers are paid less than bus/rail drivers,
there is a high turnover in shuttle drivers. He also wants to ensure that tax payer’s
dollars are going toward safe, comfortable, and reliable shuttles for their customers.



Rick Padilla, Housing Director for the City and County of Denver,
stated the City of Denver recognizes the need for more affordable housing for our
lower income constituents, and is prepared to provide substantial subsidies to help
this project. Mr. Padilla encouraged Board members to support the proposal, so the
City and County of Denver and RTD can move forward to select a developer.
