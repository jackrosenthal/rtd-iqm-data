Committee Chair Francone stated that she had gathered everyone to review
comments and recommendations from the last committee meeting with regards to
the goals and scoring of the General Manager’s performance. She remarked that
she and Chair Tobiassen will be responsible for providing feedback to General
Manager Genova and she wanted to ensure the committee conveyed constructive
comments.
Committee Chair Francone commented that the General Manager’s evaluation
resulted in an overall score of achieved, but noted that in some areas the evaluators

reached consensus of Exceeds Expectations. She asked if the committee had any
thoughts on the overall evaluation.
Director Anderson remarked that the General Manager performed well under the
circumstances but the district did not meet its expectations.

Director Bagley said he has been on this committee for eight years under three
General Managers and has always perceived that the General Manager review
process is an evaluation of how the district is doing. He stated that the General
Manager predominately met or exceeded expectations but extenuating
circumstances with the University of Colorado A line and Smart Card issues need to
be considered in his overall evaluation.
Director Menten stated that she would like to see higher thresholds. She said the
General Manager did a decent job but she would like to see more detail with
financial transparency, especially with RTD’s expansion. She added that she would
like the light rail retro-fit sped up and would like press conferences recorded.
Committee Chair Francone indicated that there is a review of benchmarking
materials on the agenda. She remarked that typically there is a discussion about
benchmarking but the General Manager’s contract is not up for renewal this year.
She added that Barbara McManus has prepared some comments for the committee
if they are needed.
Director Bagley said it is difficult to benchmark because everyone has different
methodologies, cost of living allowances, etc. He added that the General
Manager’s current contract is for a five-year term, which would keep his salary in a
comparable range. He further stated the issue of benchmarking at this time
demonstrates the performance by the General Manager and the agency, under his
direction.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said with the
information she was able to gather, RTD is in the range of other peer groups. She
said that an industry standard document released by UTA was also used in the
evaluation.
Director Archuleta stated that since the General Manager’s contract dictated his
yearly terms, the committee should implement those terms.
Committee Chair Francone remarked that the automatic increase was negotiated in
the General Manager’s contract since his pay initially began on the low end.
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 29, 2016 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone stated that the committee’s goal is to recognize the
General Manager’s accomplishments. She commented that when he took over he
had significant challenges and things did not go as planned. She remarked that the
overall evaluation states that he performed well but needed improvement.

6.A

Director Bagley added that there were significant conversations about the
automatic increase when the contract was prepared. He said that the five-year
contract provided security and the automatic increases were an attempt to even
out the salary over that timeframe. He stated that the automatic increase is part of
the contract.

Committee Chair Francone commented that, in summary, the committee would
review the recommendations in Executive Session and she, along with Chair
Tobiassen, would schedule a time to review the performance comments with the
General Manager and to inform him of the status of the discretionary payment.
Director Menten recommended that the committee perform a benchmarking audit
every year.
Director Bagley said benchmarking information is difficult to do as we are
comparing apples to oranges to grapefruit. He remarked that Dallas Area Rapid
Transit (DART), for example, gives their General Manager a $150,000 bonus every
year along with other additional perks.
Committee Chair Francone asked Barbara to perform the benchmarking exercise
again next year.
Director Lubow asked how the Board will vote. She said that she has comments in
support of the General Manager but also stated the General Manager is responsible
for the agency failures. She recommended that each Board member give their
comments to the General Manager individually.
Director Folska stated that the American Public Transportation Association (APTA)
has all of the benchmarking data and suggested that staff contact them next year
to get that information.
Barbara McManus said APTA published benchmarking information in 2012 and the
next publication will occur in 2019.
Director Anderson said in the past the committee found it is difficult to find an
exact peer agency in the United States. She stated that RTD is unique in that it
covers such a wide territory and has low density. She remarked that it is hard to
find parallels to what RTD does, but it is great to examine other agencies to see
what information is available. She said what Barbara McManus has done is great,
and the benchmarking data shows that RTD is in the ballpark for General Manager
salaries.
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Nov 29, 2016 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Francone said that the automatic increase was not to be seen as a
bonus, but rather as an acknowledgement and incentive to stay employed with RTD
for the agency’s stability.

• Positioned well to continue to meet goals and deliver service.
Director Anderson stated it was a great state of the district and she’s proud to
work for RTD, that it’s a great organization, and she’s looking forward to next year.

Director Bagley stated that the Board of Directors are part of the RTD team, and
they are just as responsible for the challenges the agency faces. He remarked that
sometimes the Board gets fixated on the larger issues such as the Smart Cards and
the University of Colorado A-Line. He noted that General Manager Genova’s State
of the Agency Address shows the bigger picture of all the things that are going on
within the agency.
Director Bagley asked General Manager Genova when he decided to hire a COO for
RTD.
General Manager Genova responded that it has been on his mind for a long time
and that with the need to integrate bus and rail operations under one area, a COO
is ideal. He stated that he wasn’t able to include this position in the 2016 budget
but now he has the opportunity to do so, with the timing of the budget cycle.
Director Archuleta asked what our shortfall of drivers is.
Bruce Abel responded that we are approximately down 70-75 drivers, though the
actual number varies on any given day due to call-offs, FMLA, etc.
Director Walker emphasized the importance of continually communicating with our
customers about any problems that arise and affect their commute. He also
mentioned that RTD’s Twitter account is timely with information. He thanked
General Manager Genova for the presentation and the great job that he is doing.
Chair Tobiassen stated how impressed he was with how RTD’s services have been
enhanced over the past eight years. He stated that when he first started he had a
dream list and most of them have come to fruition. He specified that the R line
through Aurora was on that list. He gave thanks to Lisa Trujillo and Pauline
Haberman for all their hard work and dedication to that project. Chair Tobiassen
also showed his appreciation to the Aurora Police Department for their positive
involvement with RTD to provide security on the bus/rail lines. He also recognized
that four of our mall shuttles have switched over to electric fleet; with more to
come. Included on his dream list was the Smart Card and now it’s a reality. He
also remembers suggesting RTD open up a Facebook account and now we have
one with thousands of followers. He also mentioned that the internal auditing team
does a great job and suggested cyber auditing. he emphasized how great it was
working with the staff at RTD.
Director Lubow stated that the presentation was informative and positive. She

Director Deadwyler agreed that it was a wonderful state of the district address.
She said that RTD has a lot of challenges coming up next year and asked that staff
pay more attention to the Access-a-Ride program and its patrons. She stated that
there are things that need to be prioritized and worked on.

asked if the new Manager of Continuous Innovation position would be the person
to oversee new technologies.
General Manager Genova replied that the new managerial position would be
responsible for working with employees to make process improvements, engage
and empower employees and work on efficiencies that drive innovations.
Information Technology would be tasked with overseeing new technologies and the
new COO will be responsible for looking for programs that can integrate and
complement existing services.

General Manager Genova stated that the Extraordinary Innovations team is working
on program delivery and how they can deliver transportation projects.
Director Lubow stated that she is in full support to finding funding for the unfunded
projects and to start moving forward on those projects to their completion and to
continue to work through affordable fares to enable people to have better access to
our system and to offer support to those who need it.
General Manager Genova advised that affordable fares will be represented in the
pass program working group.
Director Solano stated that he liked the idea of making diversity training mandatory
for all employees. He also asked when RTD would start collective bargaining
negotiations; once the new officers are elected.
General Manager Genova stated that they will start having conversations in mid2017.
Director James echoed the sentiments of his colleagues on a job well done. He is
looking forward not being a member of the RTD board in the future and being
comfortable in being a Denver citizen. He emphasized that he admired the way the
organization has worked through challenges. He also stated that he agrees with
Director Lubow regarding the fact that RTD needs to embrace technology. Lastly
he encourages us to partner with our peers in the community. Work towards
helping our lower income customers that have difficulty using our mobility by
partnering with other organizations; by encouraging development of housing to
compliment the transportation and jobs so customers can afford the housing.
Director Folska asked if autonomous cars will be eliminating the need of public
transportation entirely.
General Manager Genova said he believes that they will be used more to assist with
local routes and shorter trips. He stated that this is an opportunity to build in some
efficiencies; however, the biggest challenge will be affordability. General Manager
Genova also stated that the downside to autonomous vehicles is that they will
cause heavy congestion and there are regulatory environment hurdles.
Bruce Abel stated that it is important to look selectively at market segments to find

Director Lubow also mentioned a group in Los Angeles named Extraordinary
Innovations who seek out and study innovative forms of transportation. She
suggested that RTD also plan ahead for the next ten years.

where the right niche is to plug them into. Hel believes they will not be a
replacement but will play a viable role in future mobility.
Director Sisk stated that the University of Colorado A-Line and G-Line need to be at
the forefront of our operations and should the agency’s first priority.
Director Hoy commented that he was very pleased with what he has heard. He
also wanted to thank all the staff at RTD. He indicated that he was looking
forward to next year to see these current projects come to fruition and new
projects get started.

Director Solano stated that the staff does a great job and they do great things and
believes that hiring the Manager of Continuous Innovations is a brilliant move and
that this person will be a good asset to the planning division.
Director Folska stated that RTD needs to manage expectations and be proactive in
our approach. She also thanked staff for their hard work.

Lame Duck session
o Only one of the 12 spending bills has been passed for the fiscal
year that started on October 1. Federal government agencies and
programs are operating under a short-term spending bill (a “CR”)
that expires on December 9.
o Republican-led House and Senate are waiting out Obama’s final
weeks in office; with no incentive to compromise, few bills
expected to be passed– funding for Flint water crisis, national
defense.
Fiscal Year 2017 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill
o Controls funding for New Starts projects, TIGER program for FY
2017.
o Under any CR: short-term extension of FY 2016 levels for transit
formula programs under the FAST Act; no discretionary grant
awards
A big infrastructure bill in the first 100 days of the next Congress?
o Trump’s second Cabinet pick was his Transportation Secretary:

o Experienced
 Labor Secretary under George W. Bush
 Deputy Transportation Secretary under George H. W. Bush
o Unambiguously part of the Washington establishment

Another CR
o House and Senate Appropriations Committees negotiating
another short-term spending bill – through to the Spring – to
allow the incoming Trump Administration to have the final say
in FY 2017 spending priorities.
Final transportation spending levels next Spring:
o House and Senate 2017 THUD bills both fully fund transit and
highway formula programs at their FY 2017 FAST Act levels.
TIGER funding
o House $450 million, Senate at $525 (FY 2016 TIGER was
$500 million)
New Starts funding
o House $2.50 billion, Senate $2.338 billion (both
above $2.302 billion FY 2017 FAST Act authorization for New
Starts)

What does this mean for New Starts funding?
 RTD’s FY 2017 New Starts request:
o $167 million for Eagle P3 FFGA
 President’s FY 2017 budget:
o $175 million for Eagle P3 FFGA
 Pending House and Senate FY 2017 THUD appropriations bills: Both
fund the Eagle project at $150 million.
 US DOT will not award grants in discretionary programs (programs in
the
control of the Appropriators) in the absence of a full-year spending
bill.
 Bottom Line Likely that no FY 2017 New Starts funding will be
awarded until after an omnibus spending bill is enacted in the Spring.
Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal
 Timing
o Trump wants to see an infrastructure bill advance early in the
next Congress. Pelosi, other Democrats, have signaled general
support for increased infrastructure funding.
 Revenues gained through tax reform
o One-time funding through taxation of all revenues ($2.6 billion)
of US companies held overseas: “deemed” repatriation.

Finance
o Tax credit for private investors in infrastructure projects.
Funding component, too?
o Equity investors support a small fraction of transit projects, so
tax credit only part of the solution.
o Infrastructure package should include grant funding; sent out
to States through FAST Act formula programs?

Regulatory reform
o Reducing or eliminating burdensome regulations.

Opportunity for HTF Revenue Solution?
 Any infrastructure bill will attract policy riders, large and small.
 Long-sought Highway Trust revenue solution?
o Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF
revenues seen as “unfinished business” after FAST Act.
 But surface transportation funding is not a must-pass bill:
o FAST Act funds surface transportation programs through
2020.
o Other Trump priorities: trade, immigration could take
precedence.
o Competing transporation priorities in FY 2017: FAA
reauthorization.
o Some Republicans want to use tax reform only to lower rates,
not for new spending.
 Same politically difficult revenue options: taxes on gasoline, oil and
gas production, vehicle-miles traveled.
 Return of earmarks could enable support for revenue increase for
HTF.
Transit Programs in a Trump US DOT
 FAST Act in place through FY 2020:
o Second year into 5-year authorization governing overall
funding levels, transit’s share of HTF revenues, major policies
and programs.
o So major changes not expected immediately in surface
transportation
programs.
 Transit’s place in the Highway Trust Fund?
o While Republican Party platform does not support dedicated
HTF revenues for transit, Trump (www.greatagain.gov)
appears supportive of federal funding for transit.


Regulatory reform is likely:
o Streamline/reduce environmental requirements for projects
o Two-man crew rulemaking is vulnerable (Congressional Review
Act, if
finalized by Obama US DOT)
o Strong support for Buy America

o Senator Garner will lead the National Republican Senatorial

Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which has
principal jurisdiction over public transportation, has a new Chairman:
o Senator Mike Crapo (R –ID) replaces term-limited Richard
Shelby (R-AL). Sherrod Brown (D-OH) remains Ranking
Member (“RM”).
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee:
o Same “Big Four” for transit and highways: Chairman Shuster
(R-PA), RM DeFazio (D-OR), Subcommittee Chairman Graves
(R-MO), Subcommittee RM Norton (D-DC).
o Railroads Subcommittee: Rep. Denham (R-CA) held onto his
seat in a close election and returns as Chairman. Capuano (DMA) remains RM.

Director Francone asked Mike Dino to share results of I6 grant.
Mike Dino stated that the I6 grant, which Jefferson County and National Renewable

to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of an option,
and for the sale of the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street,
Denver Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds and
other property conveyance documents.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 20th
Board Meeting.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented Development,
stated that staff had discussed this item in detail with the
Board at the November 1, 2016, committee meeting. She
noted that Director Francone’s questions about maintenance
was addressed in the new Board Report under Financial Impact
and the questions about ground leasing by Directors Sisk and
Deadwyler are covered in the attached memo. She added that
staff is attempting to balance two policy goals, including
RTD’s policy for fiscal sustainability. She commented that the

Director Lasater was absent. Directors Anderson and Deadwyler participated via phone.
Director Solano left the meeting early.

City and County of Denver supports this project and has
offered RTD substantial gap financing to support a
development on the 29th and Welton site. In order to exercise
the option and complete the purchase, the following
conditions must be met:
1. Successful procurement of a development partner to
build a mixed-income condominium project according to
the terms agreed upon by RTD and the city.
2. The selected developer will need to reach an agreement
on business terms with the city.
3. The selected developer will need to secure the
financing necessary to complete the project.
Director Francone asked why the City and County of Denver
has the right to assign the option to the selected developer.
Kate Iverson stated that since the City and County of Denver
will be paying RTD fair market value for the land, the
agreement staff has negotiated stated that the City will
discuss with the developer the amount of subsidy that may be
needed. She noted that staff anticipates that the City will lead
the Request for Proposal (RFP) and procurement processes.
Director Francone commented that the property should be sold
directly to the City and County of Denver so that the city can
do what they want with the property.
Committee Chair James stated the transaction is organized so
that the title would pass through the City and County of
Denver.
Director Lubow asked about the letter from Mayor Hancock,
and what exactly was meant by the substantial gap financing.
Kate Iverson said staff’s initial analysis shows that number
could vary, but it could be in the range of $2 to $3 million.
Director Menten remarked that she is in favor of selling the
property, but she does not like the limit of only being able to
sell it to the City of Denver. She said it should be sold on the
open market to the highest bidder.
Director Sisk asked staff to include bullet points at the Board
Meeting to define what is being discussed here.

Committee Chair James stated that staff is asking the Board
to approve the execution of an option, and, under certain
conditions, complete a sale transaction.

Director Solano commented that the Board needs to find a
way to slow down gentrification. He noted he will support
this item if the City of Denver has approved this plan.
Director Deadwyler stated she has mixed feelings on this item,
but she agrees that people who live in this neighborhood need
to be able to buy in this neighborhood. She remarked that
even though this is labeled as affordable housing, it is still
expensive. She added that RTD should keep the property to
use it for a continuous revenue stream instead of selling it for
a one-time payment.
Director Anderson commented that this is a very small piece
of property and the report last month was very informative.
She added that the City of Denver has worked in this area for
a long time to provide more affordable housing options and
she is happy to partner with them.
Director Folska asked if the units will be owner occupied.
Kate Iverson explained that the intent for the units is that they
will be owner occupied, with an estimated 52 units.
Director Folska inquired as to what percentage of the units
would be classified as affordable.
Kate Iverson said staff could determine a number and define a
percentage of units within the resolution that would be labeled
affordable.
Director Deadwyler stated that most likely the affordable
housing units would only be 10% of the total units. She
commented if there will be 52 units, as staff has previously
estimated, only 5 of those would be available as affordable
housing units.

Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 6, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tobiassen noted one issue is gentrification in
neighborhoods where RTD has invested in infrastructure. He
said this is a good opportunity, and the City of Denver has
come up with an option to keep people in their neighborhoods.

6.C

Director Hoy noted that the Board’s goal should be to sell the
property and use those funds to move people from point A to
point B.

Director Lubow remarked that one of the reasons the Board is
discussing this is to improve the areas where RTD has installed
transit. She said a big component of this plan is to offer
affordable housing and, if the affordable units are minimal in
comparison to the overall number, that would not suffice.
Director Bagley explained that staff is discussing getting an
appraisal for this property. He said if the Board constraints the
property to 50% affordable housing, the property value will
drop significantly. He added that the land size is only 19,000
square feet, which is quite small.
Director Walker stated he is in favor of letting the City and
County of Denver determine the numbers and market for
affordable housing.
Director Anderson indicated she would be voting yes for this
item.
Director Deadwyler stated she would be voting no for this
item.

C. Updates

• Platte Division Zoning and Land Value
Bill Sirois stated that staff was asked to look at the value of the Platte
property in relation to the City and County of Denver’s rezoning. On
September 19, 2016, the Denver City Council adopted the 38th and Blake
Station Area Height Amendments. The amendments allow for greater
minimum and maximum height at several properties northeast of 31st Street.
The area was rezoned from light industrial use to a form-based code base
height of 8 stories to an incentive height of 12 stories. He noted that based
on comparable property values, Platte Division’s value for sale or groundlease could range from $82 million to $132 million. He added that selling or
ground-leasing RTD’s property would require replacing the bus-maintenance
and operations services, and replacement costs would be between $80 to
$120 million, excluding land costs.
Director Bagley said he wanted the Board to be aware of what is happening
around this property, but he does not think RTD needs to pursue any
additional actions.

• 16th Street Mall
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, reminded the Board
that staff provided an update during the November 1, 2016, meeting and
indicated that the technical working group did not come up with a
consensus on the transit way design. He stated that RTD’s focus remains
on the transit way surface, not the full mall reconfiguration and added that
RTD’s priority is to maintain the 16th Street Mall Shuttle Operations, as well
as safety for our passengers.

Bill Van Meter indicated 25% to 30% is transit way and the rest is
pedestrian.
Director Lubow stated that the transit way needs to be analyzed, not the
entire configuration of the mall.
General Manager Genova commented that there is only so much funding
available that RTD would be able to commit to. He added that the
conceptual cost estimates for a major reconfiguration would be very
expensive.
Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, said RTD has $10 million from one
grant, and $5 million from another, and that would be all that RTD could
contribute towards a reconstruction effort. She added that the technical
working group could not reach a consensus and it is in RTD’s interest to get
through the environmental process in order to move forward.
Director Solano commented that staff discussed issues raised by the
historical society a year ago. He asked if they could deter RTD’s plans for
the mall.
Susan Wood stated that the historical society is very vocal. They have a
large presence, but they are only one voice. She stated that RTD must go
through a cultural resources process, and they could impact us by slowing
that process down.
Director Walker said 80% of RTD’s customers use the sidewalks in order to
get to the bus. He remarked that we need to look at this as a partnership
with the City and County of Denver.
Chair Tobiassen asked if the $700,000 study would make the project ready
to go.

Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 6, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone asked what the split was between the surface area for the
totality of the mall.

6.C

Bill Van Meter said that it would get us all the way through some design
work, but it would not include the final design. He noted that the final
design would be eligible for federal grant reimbursement.
Chair Tobiassen remarked that our federal lobbyists said that there is a
possibility that the new presidential administration will make a large
infrastructure push. He stated that it would be beneficial to RTD if the
project were ready to go.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten inquired about the status of the garage on Ringsby that is planned
to be torn down.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, stated that as
of now, the building will be repurposed for facilities maintenance.
Committee Chair James said this will be his last opportunity to chair this committee
and he has been honored to lead the committee. He stated that this committee has
always partnered with FasTracks and that next year the two will be consolidated to
Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• I-225
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, stated
that the Kiewit Team continues to test the R Line and the entire team is
working days and nights to continue their work. He said that once Kiewit
finishes their work, Rail Operations can complete pre-revenue testing. He
commented that the biggest challenge right now is the train traffic interface
in the downtown loop. He added that testing is underway, but an opening
date will not be released at this time. He remarked that the R Line, minus
the downtown loop, is ready to be transferred to Rail Operations.

• North Metro Operations & Maintenance
Henry Stopplecamp stated that this item deals with how RTD will operate
and maintain North Metro. He said last time he approached the Board there
were three items to consider: extend the contract with Denver Transit
Partners (DTP), put the Commuter Rail under RTD Rail Operations, or hire a
Third Party operator. He remarked that staff has explored all three options,
and it would be cost effective to allow DTP to maintain the commuter rail
fleet. He added that staff continues to review the options and they are
examining the cost benefits and associated risks.

Director Bagley stated that he had attended the Denver South Economic Partnership
Holiday event and he had over 20 conversations about the Southwest Corridor
extension. He wanted to hand that off to the new Board as there is interest in
getting that project completed.
Henry Stopplecamp noted that there will be a University of Colorado A-Line
Technical Update on Wednesday, December 14th from 12:30 – 2:00 p.m. He
added that a third temporary shelter had been installed at Broadway and Lincoln,
and all temporary shelters will be completed by this week.
Director Menten asked from a drivers point of view, how long are drivers actually
waiting at the gate crossings on the University of Colorado A-Line.
Henry Stopplecamp stated that the crossing arms are only down for one minute.
He remarked that there is a longer wait when Union Pacific changes tracks, as their
trains cause RTD’s crossing arms to go down too, but the wait times are not longer
than a minute.

B. Recommended Actions

• DUSPA Refinancing Proposal
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds
(FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to
retire certain outstanding obligations; providing for other matters related to
such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance & Administration, stated that RTD has
been working with the City and County of Denver and the
Denver Union Station Planning Authority (DUSPA) Board to
find a way to refinance both of our current debt so we could
repay the TIFFA and RIFF loan by lowering the debt and
payments. Collectively they have found a situation that will
enable both RTD and the City and County of Denver to

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments,
stated that DUSPA was established in 2008 to implement the
construction improvements to Union Station. In 2010, RTD
entered into a funding agreement with DUSPA, that stated
that RTD would pay DUSPA 12 Million Dollars per year for
next 30 years that included an interest rate of 5.8%.
Brendon, talked how DUSPA was able to use that revenue
stream along with other revenue streams to procure some
loans from the U.S. Department of Transportation through
RRIF and TIFIA loans. In 2016, Brad Langner from Piper
Jaffray pitched the idea to refinancing DUSPA for interest
savings. Fantastic idea on the surface – DUSPA put out an
RFP for refinancing ideas, DUSPA received 7 responses that
were reviewed by the board along with RTD and City and
County staff. Brendon, remarked that the best joint proposal
came from Piper Jaffray and BBVA Compass Bank. The
saving that will be incurred by this transaction is substantial;
in the amount of approximately $87 Million dollars. All RFP
documentation is available in the Board Office.
Director Bagley stated it was to serve on the DUSPA board for
the past 6 years. He remarked that in reading all the
proposals, Piper Jaffray and BBVA was the best proposal that
was prepared. He emphasized that this is a fantastic
opportunity for RTD and stated that RTD can finally retire the
RRIF and TIFIA loans through the federal government. Lastly,
he indicated that the City and County of Denver will save
nearly double what RTD will be saving.
Director James said the DUSPA board was an excellent
example of partners collaborating. He thanked Brenden
Morgan for his work with this transaction.

that was brought to the Board in September, but this is being
brought back to the Board to be done on a standalone basis.
He remarked that the latest numbers show that RTD would

• Update to the 2017 Quarterly Performance Report
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopt updated 2017 Quarterly Performance
Measures to include measures for ridership, fare revenue, total operating
revenue, and commuter rail.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this

Heather Copp stated that at the time the Board approved the

couple of items that were still dependent on the 2017 budget
including the commuter rail performance measures.
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager, Budget and Financial
Analyst, stated that overall ridership increase will be 6.8% for
2017. She also stated that fare revenue would be increased
by 15.5% and the 2017 Operating Revenue will increase by
15.9%; both in agreement with the 2017 Budget. She stated
that the annual audits were changing from the number of
audits to the percent completion of the annual audit plan as
approved by the Board. This goal is 100% of the plan for the

defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) not to exceed $600,000
over a maximum of 5 years.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December 20,
2016 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan stated that financial advisors are necessary to
complete the issuance and refunding of bonds to help RTD
capture the lowest cost of capital available on the market. He
explained that Investment banks are no longer allowed to
discuss financing ideas with government entities unless they
have retained a Financial Advisor; which will share innovated
ideas and find ways to save money. In October, RTD put out a
RFP for Financial Advisors. Three firms responded and they
were reviewed by five RTD employees, and First Southwest
Company’s proposal was deemed to be the best fit for RTD’s
needs. He stated that the contract will be for three years with

year. She also remarked that RTD will be adding a new goal
commuter rail to reduce accidents by 1.5%, this goal is similar
to the light rail goal which is less than or equal to 2. There is
an addition to 3.1, a 90% on-time performance for the
commuter rail which is similar to light rail. She also stated
that there will be an addition to 3.2; purposing 97% for
service availability.

two optional extensions for a total 600,000. He noted that the
contract was included in the 2017 adopted budget.
Director Sisk confirmed that First Southwest, as our financial
advisor, will not participate on the other side of any financial
transaction.

• Naming Rights Implementation
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors approve transferring $144,000 from the Board
Appropriated Reserve to the Naming Rights Implementation Project for
signage and the 2016 commission to WME/ IMG.

Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December 20,
2016 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp stated that in 2015, it was decided that naming
rights funds should be deposited in the Board Appropriated
Reserve. With this decision it was also known that there
would be instances when funds may need to be drawn from
the reserve to pay for on-going commissions and other
contractual obligations. She explained that funds are currently
needed to pay a commission to WME/ING and there are some
signage obligations that staff needs to fulfill in regards to the
University of Colorado A Line naming rights contract. She
added that moving forward, commission fees will
automatically be part of the budget

Director Hoy asked if all future funds collected for naming
rights will be put into the Board Appropriated Reserve.

Director Hoy asked why the University of Colorado A line
signs just now being installed.
Scott Reed said that staff has been working with the
University of Colorado’s (C.U.) Vice-President regarding proper
branding to provide weather proof signage.
Director Hoy asked if C.U. is ok with the delay of their signs
being installed.
Scott Reed assured Director Hoy that he has been in
communication with C.U. and they are aware of the delays
and they are on board with the instillation timeline.
Director Menten asked for more information about the conflict
with the Arden Transit.
Scott Reed said Arden Transit has benches that are considered
works of art and they cannot be altered in any way. The
reason that the conflict arose was because RTD wanted to
modify the benches to suit our needs, which would have been
in conflict with the overall design of the bench.
Director Menten requested additional documentation regarding
the proposed project.

Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop, Internal Audit Manager, stated that

• Annual Audit Plan 2017
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2017.
Director Anderson made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December
20, 2016 Board Meeting
Director Lubow seconded the motion.
Discussion: Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that
the packet offers a summary of what the plan will entail. It is
the goal to accomplish 100% of the audits proposed in the
plan. She said that some of the follow up audits are
incomplete as the audit department is limited on time;
however, there are plans to conduct more follow up audits in
2017. There are a handful of audits that will need to continue
year after year such as FasTracks, Smart Card and Cyber
Security. She also stated that with so many audit hours
dedicated, it can be hard to fulfill every request. She
remarked that if time becomes available in the future, then she
will come to the board and prioritize the remaining requests.
Director Bagley asked how the audit plan is structured or
prioritized within the plan.
Ann Marie responded that there is a heavy process in
determining what is included in the annual plan. She stated
that there are over a dozen requested audits from last year
that have rolled over to this year.
Director Bagley stated that there seems to be a lot of audit
requests from board members, but the person requesting the
audit is unknown. He asked how the audit department
prioritized the Board’s requests.
Ann Marie responded that she meets with each board member
that is requesting an audit to vet through the process to
determine if their request is even auditable. She explained that
Packet Pg. 56

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 13, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Motion:

6.E

sometimes requests are actually part of another audit. She
added that the audit department has to determine realistic
objectives to determine if a request is actually an audit and if
the audit will have an impact on RTD’s policies and
procedures.

General Manager Genova responded that he is aware and
expressed that the audit department is looking specifically for
audits that have the most value and substantial impacts to our
agency. He added that RTD wants to conduct audits that
reduce our risk and build efficiencies.

C. Updates

• Quarterly Audit Update
Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop stated that she has prepared an update with three
complete audits; two that are in draft stage and one that is circulating she
added that audits will completed for 2016 as amended.

• October 2016 Monthly Financial Statement
Doug MacLeod, Controller, indicated that there was an even number of
green and red for the month of October. He said Sales and Use taxes
continue to be down and ridership maintains the same trends despite the
new service lines. He added that fare revenue is up, and we are $2.3 million
ahead of budget. He noted that while RTD is under budget by $2.2 million
overall, staff has managed to keep our expenses low and we are on target
for this year.
Director Bagley said the assumptions are looking better than they did three
to four months ago. He stated if we are getting internet taxes from

Director Bagley asked General Manager Genova if he was

and if he thinks they are appropriate.

Amazon, then the shortfall could be significantly less than what is projected
here.
Chair Tobiassen said he was concerned with the passing of the new fare
structure at the begging of the year, and asked if staff feels that our initial
expectations will be met.
Heather Copp stated that staff did have to adjust the fare down, but the
agency is doing better here at the end of the year.

Doug MacLeod said a new law was established to encourage online retailers
to collect taxes. He stated that the US Supreme Court ruled that the law
was just, but there is a state injunction in place that will need to be resolved
first.

• SmartCard Project Update
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, stated that the
disaster recovery testing is scheduled for this month. Xerox is providing the
mediation that we needed for testing. She stated that staff is continuing to
work with Safeway to schedule training, however, with the blackout that
most stores have during the holiday season, this may not happen this
month. She informed the Board that staff is working on a schedule for site
surveys at 58 stores which is required prior to installing the equipment. She
also gave an update on the reliability, maintainability and accuracy testing.
She indicated that testing was completed on the hardware and the system
that drives the hardware. She noted that there were several issues
regarding mediation during this first phase, but Xerox is working to resolve
those issues within the next following weeks.
Heather Copp stated that Xerox has 28 days to fix the hardware issue. She
also gave an update on Cyber Security and stated RTD should be receiving
CPI Compliance Certification on December 23rd. She noted that once we
receive that certification it will state that Xerox has passed all of their CPI
requirements and once we receive that document, staff will be able to test
the web portal environment again.
Director Menten summarized Heather’s statement by saying that we have
identified the problem and Xerox will have until December 23, 2016 to
resolve, followed by a period of testing.
Chair Tobiassen stated that he found it troubling that the platform validators
were having issues and asked why it is taking so long to be resolved.

Committee Chair Menten asked for details on the Amazon court ruling.

6.E

Heather Copp responded that she is continually having parts replaced under
the warranty. She said that the notice to cure allowed staff to shed light on
the validator issues and we will have to see how Xerox remediates those
issues.

Heather Copp said RTD could terminate the contract, however, that could
set us back on our progress. She noted that staff has been working with
Legal on our rights in regards to the contract but it is a difficult process. She
added that currently, RTD has 400,000 cards that exist in the Eco and
College Pass program and if we terminate the contract, RTD does not have a
method for those people to use our system.
General Manager Genova stated that if Xerox does not address these items,
then they will continue to be in default.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the Finance department is
working very closely with Legal to make sure that RTD is positioned well if
there are further issues. He noted that further discussions in relation to this
contract should be discussed during an Executive Session.
Director Lasseter stated that big companies are sometimes lax on their
product. He encouraged the new board members to push hard to find more
expedient and less expensive providers.
Director Solano asked if we are communicating through legal briefs with
Xerox.
Rolf Asphaug responded that RTD submitted a written Notice to Cure. He
stated that any follow up since then has been in accordance with the notice
to cure procedures.

• Third Quarter 2016 Performance Report
Janette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, shared
the year to date indicators through September 30, 2016. She noted that
the Board Report is self-explanatory and indicated that the third quarter is
stable, similar to the second quarter. She added that customer complaints
are about the same and we are seeing ridership improving and fare revenue
is above goal

Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December 20,
2016, Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Director Deadwyler asked who would enforce the code of
conduct.
Rolf Asphaug indicated that most of these items were
common sense items that people know not to do anyway. He
said that a bus or rail operator would contact transit security
should an issue occur.
Director Deadwyler inquired if there might be a situation where
bus or rail operators would try to enforce the code of conduct.
Rolf Asphaug stated that bus and rail operators would not
enforce the code of conduct, but they might offer a gentle
reminder.
Director Deadwyler asked how staff will inform RTD’s
ridership about the code of conduct once it is passed by the
Board before it goes into effect.
Rolf Asphaug noted that RTD’s Leadership Academy has been
working on a marketing campaign to promote the code of
conduct.
Rolf Asphaug added that the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) had two minor changes to the code of conduct: Item
15 would now read as “Distributing or posting handbills in
RTD vehicles, or on RTD property or vehicles parked on RTD
property” and Item 21 would now read as “Engaging in
activities not authorized by RTD’s Facilities Use Policy”.
Steve Martingano, Transit Policy Commander and Fare
Enforcement Officer, stated that RTD has reached out to the
Homeless Coalition and we provided them with a copy of the
new Code of Conduct. He stated that they did not request
any changes, but they did provide staff with locations to place
the Code of Conduct pamphlets so that people can easily
access them. He noted that the majority of the public are
already adhering to the Code of Conduct, but the written
document is for security to show in case they are asked to
prove something in writing.

Discussion:

6.F

Committee Chair Anderson asked the mover and the seconder
if they would accept the two minor changes suggested by Rolf
Asphaug. Directors Deadwyler and Chair Tobiassen said yes.

Rolf Asphaug stated that RTD’s policy for expressive speech
was approved several years ago and it allows for expressive
activities. The only exception is expressive activities may not
occur in interior spaces. He noted that generally, the policy is
supportive of first amendment activities because it is very
broad and applied with a light touch, and so far, people have
been okay with it.
Director Deadwyler asked if a smoking section had been
created on RTD property.
Rolf Asphaug indicated that RTD does not have the rights at
our bus stops to tell people they can or cannot smoke. He
stated that for a typical location in Denver, RTD does not
regulate smoking unless it is within 15 feet of an interior
space.
Director Bagley asked when staff could post signs at the
Littleton and Mineral light rail stations to inform passengers
that smoking is prohibited.
Rolf Asphaug commented that staff would have to come back
to the Board with more information for that particular item.
Director Bagley stated that RTD needs to protect its property
from cigarette litter that is not covered by local jurisdictions.
Director Bagley inquired about item 23 and the use of light rail
boarding ramps. He stated that the Code of Conduct says the
ramps are not for patrons with luggage, bicycles or shopping
carts. He asked if someone had a 50-pound suitcase, how will
they get on to the light rail train.
Rolf Asphaug noted the intent of item 23 is to demonstrate
that the ramps are meant for and the priority is given to
disabled passengers, except with operator permission. He said
the ramps can be used for other purposes, but the priority
must be given to ADA passengers.

Director Menten requested that the motion be amended so
that item 20 would read as “Engaging in unwanted
conversation with any other person while such person is a
captive audience (i.e., standing in line for a vehicle, or while

Director Sisk seconded the motion.
Committee Chair Anderson stated there was a motion and a
second to amend.
Director Francone remarked that she has had personal
experience with being harassed on a light rail car and while
she is not opposed to Director Menten’s amendment, she
thinks the language should be left as is.
Director Deadwyler commented that she is okay with
removing petitioning, but soliciting needs to stay.
Director Walker said he is opposed to any change to this item
as it represents a specific type of activity at a specific point of
time. He said that item 20 does not infringe on anyone’s first
amendment rights.
Director Bagley noted that he preferred the specificity of item
20 and both petitioning and soliciting should stay.
Director Menten stated she would accept keeping soliciting as
long as petitioning was removed.
Steve Martingano added that Denver has an aggressive
panhandling law. He said if the language is kept as is, it
would be useful for educational purposes.
Committee Chair Anderson called for the vote on Director
Menten’s amendment to the motion to remove petitioning, and
keeping soliciting so that item 20 says, “Soliciting, or

He stated that the ramps should not be used by patrons with
strollers.
Rolf Asphaug commented that patrons with ADA strollers
would have priority use of the ramps, but they are not
intended for non-ADA strollers. He added that RTD has
provisions for strollers in the Trailblazer, and stroller issues
should be addressed on a case by case basis by the vehicle
operator.
Director Sisk stated he has an issue with item 13 concerning
eating on any RTD vehicle. He said item 13 prohibits any
eating, and he has serious concerns with where staff and the
Board is going with candy bars and candy. He noted that
littering, including spilled foods and liquids are covered in item
16.

Rolf Asphaug remarked that right now, buses say no eating.
Trailblazer’s say there is to be no eating on RTD vehicles. He
noted that as a practical matter, it will not be an issue if
someone pulls out a lifesaver or lozenge.

Rolf Asphaug indicated that no one would bother someone
who is feeding their child. He added that garbage receptacles
in vehicles would be a security concern, and the various

3. Updates

• L Line Service Proposal Planning and Operations
Bruce Abel said the first update is to provide information to the Board. He
stated that staff is evaluating a new concept and service, the L Line. He
noted that it will bifurcate the D Line to create a downtown loop.
Eric Miller, Senior Rail Service Planner/Scheduler, indicated that the L Line
would run on a loop making transfers to other lines possible. He stated that
the L Line will fit into other changes within the system. He commented that
the next steps will be to work on the equity analysis and Welton Survey
later this year.
Bruce Abel noted that the service change process for May 2017 is ambitious
and as of right now, this is only a concept that staff is proposing. He said
that this is not a definite service change.

Director Folska said that when she was going to school, her
commute was two hours each way. She asked why the buses
and trains do not have garbage receptacles to collect litter.
She said there are people who are diabetics who need to eat,
and young children need to eat too.

6.F

Director Bagley said he is in favor of moving forward with this as it is an
improvement of service, and it will save RTD money.
Director Lubow asked if there would be any cost involved in starting this
new service.

General Manager Genova added that this is a service plan change, so the
costs would come from the Base System.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
indicated that costs would be under $100,000. He said that staff would
need parts, materials and updates to the switches.
Bruce Abel noted that this service is not intended to replace the central
connector. He said this is to improve the current system, and if all goes
well, service could begin with the August Run Board.

 Eagle Review (no back-up)
General Manager Genova said that yesterday he, along with Greg Straight,
Henry Stopplecamp, Mike Meader and Denver Transit Partners staff (DPT)
were in Washington D.C. to meeting with the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA). He said that staff presented a progress report on the
At Grade crossings and most of the items on the progress report have been
completed. He said a full update will be provided to the Board tomorrow
during the lunch and learn.

 Olde Town Arvada Service Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel stated that bus service from Olde Town Arvada to Union Station
will begin on Sunday, December 18th. He said service will be operated by
Rambling Express via the Charter Authorization and funding which was
approved at the November Board meeting. He stated that Rambling will
operate the service until the January Run Board at which point in time staff
will examine if we can operate that service internally.

• Lost Service Hours Review 12 13 16
Committee Chair Anderson indicated that the next seven items were reports
that the Board had included in their packets for review. She asked if there
were any questions.
Bruce Abel added that staff is prepared to answer any questions the Board
may have.

Board Office Organizational Structure
Chair Tobiassen explained that the Board adopted the updated bylaws in November,
and within those revisions there was a change to the Board Office management
structure so that the Executive manager of the Board Office will report to a staff
member AGM instead of the Chair of the Board. He said that this will provide
organizational structure and a link to the organization. He noted that generally,
things will stay the way that they currently are.
Barbara McManus added that her performance appraisal will now be completed
inside the current system.
Chair Tobiassen stated that the Executive Committee and Board Chair will still have
input on the overall role of this position. He said it is up to the Executive
Committee to decide who the Executive Manager of the Board will report to.
General Manager Genova indicated that there are two departments that may be a
good fit: Finance and Administration or Legal.
General Manager Genova noted the he, along with the Board Chair, have discussed
various departments such as Finance and Administration, or Legal as possible
options. He stated that both would be a good fit for various reasons, and both of
the department heads are capable leaders. He added that both been approached on
this topic and are willing and able.
Director Deadwyler remarked that she has a concern with the Executive Manager of
the Board reporting to another entity within the organization. She said that it will
remove the confidentiality of the Board Office staff.
Barbara McManus commented that the Board Office would still report to the Board
and the Chair, but in the interest of continuity of how everyone else within RTD is
being managed, the Executive Manager of the Board will be placed under one of the
current AGM’s. She said the only item that would be different and impacted, is
how her end of year review is done.
Chair Tobiassen said the Executive Manager’s relationship with the Board is similar
to that of General Counsel. He stated that they work for the Board and must
maintain confidentiality.

Director Deadwyler stated that the Board needs someone to represent the best
interests of the Board.

Director Deadwyler stated with this change she fears that Barbara will not be able
to represent the Board to the best of her ability.
Chair Tobiassen indicated that this change is in the bylaws now, as the revision
was approved by the Board last month.
Barbara McManus asked the Chair to expand on why he thought this organizational
change was appropriate.
Chair Tobiassen said the risk is that the Board would be liable for certain actions,
whereas this change to the organizational structure puts some degree of separation
between the Board and Staff, and vice versa. He noted that this would provide a
layer of separation.
Director Hoy added that it will also prevent the singular Chairman of the Board from
changing pay scales and similar such actions. He noted that in the past the
Executive Manager to the Board reported to the Chair, and the Chair had enough
authority, without a proper review, to arbitrarily increase the salary or benefits of
the position without the rest of the Board’s input.
Chair Tobiassen added that the Chair could also fire that individual for any reason,
which would put the Chair and the Board at risk.
Director Hoy remarked that this sets up a much needed process but the
organizational change is not intended to change the Board staff’s relationship to the
Board.
General Manager Genova noted all RTD employees are under the same set of
procedures and processes as well.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 15, 2016 1:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Barbara McManus explained that her support of the Board and confidentially
requirements will not change. She said the only noticeable change will be at the
end of the year, when her performance evaluation is completed. She stated that
the designated manager, to be chosen by the Executive Committee, will be part of
the performance evaluation process with the Board Chair and Executive Committee.

Director Francone indicated that she had some of the same hesitations as Director
Deadwyler with respect to confidentiality. She said that having General Counsel be
in charge would add an extra layer of confidentially. She said that the Board needs
to make sure the Board Office has a clear chain of command, and has the same
opportunities the rest of the agency does with raises and or disciplinary actions.
She noted that this is not intended to get between the Board and the Board office,
but rather to establish a clearer line. She added that it will insulate the Board
Office should the Chair fire the Executive Manager. She noted that she will be
concerned if Barbara reports directly to General Manager Genova, as that would be
a conflict of interest.
Director Deadwyler stated her concern is for the best interests of the Board. She
said now the line between the General Manager and Finance, or General Counsel
would be blurred.
Chair Tobiassen commented that in the event there was a legal action in the Board
Office, if Rolf as General Counsel were to be the direct report, he would have to
take the whole department out of the legal loop to address that complaint because
of the direct conflict of interest.
Director Francone said if there were ever an issue, the complainant is going to hire
outside counsel.
Barbara McManus indicated that to her, it is important that whomever is chosen
will be working with the Chair and Executive Committee for her performance
evaluation and the Board Office staff. She noted that it should be a department
that works closely with the Board Office, and said her preference would be Legal.
She explained that the exposure of what goes on in this office is clear, and that the
Board Office and Legal work more closely together.
Director Hoy commented that dual reporting is challenging and can be a difficult
task.
Barbara McManus indicated that she does not view it as a conflict and does not
anticipate any challenges. She said there was so much going on this year that the
Chair does not have any agency background to properly make a decision. She
noted that some of the questions Chair asked were answered by snippets of the big
picture. She stated that it is impossible for the Board to know all of the detail,
management directives, and procedures, and that the Chair was very challenged by
that this year.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, entered the meeting.

Barbara McManus said it is the purview of the Board to hire outside counsel for
anything and the Board Office has the budget for that. She added that if a
situation should arise that Rolf mentioned, the Board is covered.
Chair Tobiassen reminded the committee that the matter was not a voting matter at
this time and had received all of the comments that he needed. He said that he
would move forward in a day or so with his decision.
V.

Review and Approval of 2017 Calendar
Barbara McManus indicated that the 2017 Board Meeting Calendar has been
provided to Senior Leadership and discussed. She stated that all of the holidays,
conferences, and meetings are on the calendar as well as five finance workshops.
She asked for the Directors to provide their comments by the end of the week if
anything needed to be changed or corrected.
Director Francone asked if a Board Meeting could be changed if there were a
conflict.
Barbara McManus said it would depend on the meeting schedule.
General Manager Genova indicated that staff could prepare for Tuesday and
Thursday meetings if there are critical timings or issues.

VI.

Other Matters
Director Bagley asked the General Manager to provide an update on the video
recording of all meetings by the Board.
General Manager Genova said that staff is gathering pricing now and the preffered
option is to add a module onto MinuteTraq that would attach the video recordings
to the agenda and presentations. He said that adding video recording is not cost
prohibitive, and this will be done in conjunction with RTD’s security group as they
are doing the camera instillation and wiring. He added that staff is trying to

Rolf Asphaug noted that he shared with Chair Tobiassen and Director Francone his
concerns about the evaluation process. He said if there is an issue that potentially
arises to a legal claim, internal counsel would be conflicted out. He indicated that
whichever position is chosen, he would anticipate that the entire Board would be
asked how the Board Staff is performing.

determine whether an employee will run the system or if that task will be
outsourced.
Barbara McManus added that the infrastructure was evaluated last week. She said
that she would have a better timeline tomorrow, but currently staff is moving this
project along very efficiently.

Barbara McManus indicated that she would have a better idea after her meeting
tomorrow, but the hardware and software from MinuteTraq is close to $20,000
and that would be a yearly hosting fee.
Director Bagley indicated that he has been on the General Manager Oversight
Committee for several years, and he suggested that the committee continue to
have seven members, and that the Board Chair continue to serve on that
Committee.
Director Francone added that the Board Chair is uniquely positioned because they
have almost day to day communication with the General Manager. She noted that
the Board Chair has a unique perspective to share with the General Manager
Oversight Committee, and the odd number will help break any tie.
Director Bagley asked that in the future, the Board members make more of an effort
to say why they want to attend a conference, and what they plan to learn. He
stated that these are not social functions and the Board should bring something
educational back from these conferences.
Chair Tobiassen thanked the General Manager and staff for the A Line Technical
Update. He said that he learned a lot and the session was very informative. He
suggested that the General Manager host a class like that for the Board at least
once a month.
Chair Tobiassen added that this is his last Executive Committee meeting and he
thanked the committee for all of their hard work and the help that they provided.
He also thanked Barbara McManus and the Board Office staff for their efforts in
supporting the Board.

Special Recognition
Jerry Torres – Life Saving Award
John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, recognized Officer Jerry Torres for his assistance in a
pursuit to apprehend a man who fatally shot a man on the 16th Street Mall. The suspect
boarded an RTD bus, and Officer Torres along with a Denver police officer and an officer
from the Department of Homeland Security surrounded the bus with their weapons drawn
in an attempt to take the suspect into custody. At the same time, Officer Torres noticed a
woman in a car trying to get her child out of a car seat near the scene, and he went over
to help her, got them out of their car, and shielded them both from harm.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated that public participation was open to anyone who wanted to
address the Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Bob Fifer, Arvada Mayor Pro Tem, indicated he was present on behalf of the
Arvada City Council and his constituency regarding the service impact between
Arvada and Denver International Airport (DIA). He stated that since the Arvada A
Line was discontinued over a month ago, and with the delay of the G Line, his
community has been negatively impacted. He added that providing an express bus
that simulated the frequency of the commuter rail to Union Station it would secure
ridership and help people become familiar with the timing and travel through Union

Station to DIA. He formerly requested the Board’s support to provide alternative
service between Olde Town Arvada and Union Station so that travelers could use
this temporary and alternative travel to DIA before the holiday season. He thanked
the Board for their time and service to the community.
Joe Triplett, Aurora, expressed his gratefulness for the new Access-A-Ride buses.
He stated that the lift is wider and the tracks go all the way from the front to the
back. He commented that while the seats fold up, the suspension and shocks have
not improved. He added that this is the first time that RTD has worked with its
customers to improve service and he looks forward to working with RTD in the
future.
General Bernie Rogoff, Greenwood Village, spoke on behalf of the of the United
Veteran’s Committee of Colorado (UVC) to offer their gratitude for offering all
active military personnel free bus service. He noted that currently there are no
transportation options from the new R Line to the new VA Hospital and asked the
Board to review the area to see what could be done.
Bob Wilson, Arvada, echoed Mayor Pro Tem Fifer’s comments. He said the
proposal to establish service from Olde Town Arvada to Union Station is a welcome
one to get people familiar with transferring at Union Station. He added that the
residents miss the Arvada A Line and this proposed new service, would help RTD
with outreach efforts in the community.
Doug Gragg, Denver, said Scott Reed has done a good job of explaining things to
news outlets but noted a lot of people do not watch the news. He proposed
charging the contractors for the lack of good will that has been propagated
throughout the city. He stated that RTD needs compensation and estimated that
RTD needs $11 million dollars which would balance the budget.

Chair Tobiassen asked if there were any other speakers that wished to address the Board.
Seeing none, he thanked everyone who spoke for their comments.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the
governing body by October 15, 2016. By legal notice, the governing body
presented the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8,

Packet Pg. 89

8.A

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget
(combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating
expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized
interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt
payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million,
FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of
$29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating
reserve of $9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million.
The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum
of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.
Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase
$174.0 million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase
is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in
sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of
$122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by
a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.




Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million
are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. On
the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and
ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal. For FasTracks, farebox
revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks
service corridors brought on-line in 2016. The FasTracks estimate is per
the Annual Program Evaluation. Any ridership increases are attributed to
FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase
6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most recent
September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CULeeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the
unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.

2016. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the
November 29, 2016 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.





Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the
2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base
System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that
amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected carryforward grant
funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are budgeted at $328.9 million,
an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget largely due
to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to
the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with
deployment of invested funds. An expected small increase in interest rates
will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of
$9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year
payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and
an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in
2017 (excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016
Re-Amended Budget. Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase
$8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease
$24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
increase $3.8 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are
targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance
increases for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV
spare parts, wages and salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases
unknown at the time of the SBP. For FasTracks Operations, the increase is
generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating the
new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense to
FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for
Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks
Operations. It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to
departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset
unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price
of $2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of
approximately $5.3 million. Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the
SBP, the savings is $1.2 million. This differential between the SBP and actual lock
price is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.

The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to
the posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the
changes from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an
increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due
to the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO
service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full
year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This increase is offset by a
reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing.
Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4
million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at
$33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized
interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis,
which is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System
principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled
amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail). FasTracks principal
payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled
principal amortization on current debt. No new debt issuances are planned in
2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously
issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016
(previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new
capital for 2017. The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of
$166.1 million on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in
FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to
$234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset
by increases to North Metro. For the Base System, new capital spending will
decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will
spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily
Customer Care Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million

Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price
of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.

on systems planning (mostly Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project). These
increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on bus infrastructure, $49.4 million
less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million less in capital
support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The Base System new
capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and
is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017
Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget
Plan are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017
and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget
over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base
System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to
$2.0 million. This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of
$2.0 million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual
amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to
lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become
evident in the 2017 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Boardappropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the
capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million,
and an unrestricted operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at
$9.7 million.
The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at
$15.9 million. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund,
capital replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of
operating expenses up from 2 months previously.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase
$2.9 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Boardappropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating
reserve are projected to increase by $25.3 million in total. These increases are in
minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base
System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy
below.

Packet Pg. 93

Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the
Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax
revenue except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including
depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term
planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target
of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Boardappropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end
fund balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional
unrestricted operating reserve currently for the Base System. The objective is for
the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both
Base System and FasTracks. The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a
FasTracks management reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed
sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is
projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted
operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund
balance of $14.3 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances listed
for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of
accounting with two exceptions:





Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
explained that staff is estimating $2000 a day to provide the

pricing is based on running hourly, bi-directional services until
9:00 p.m. He added that the funds should carry RTD shuttle
services until the end of July 2017, if needed.
Director Deadwyler stated that cost shouldn’t be an issue
when suspended services is an issue. She added that she was
disappointed District L had to wait so long for a Board vote to
get the service back.
Director Solano asked if the same 501c3 organization will be
running the shuttle service.
Bruce Abel stated that services will be operated by RTD, but
staff is determining if we will run the route ourselves, or if we
will use one of our contractors. He noted that RTD will no
longer use Ride Provide.
Director Anderson stated that she appreciates the support of
the Board. She noted that while her community looks forward
to the G-Line, it’s imperative to have some form of service in

A Line bus shuttle services.
Director Hoy asked when the new services would begin.
Bruce Abel stated that staff is still working on the details, but
Staff anticipates a December start time. He noted that staff
still has to determine whether the line can be operated
internally, or if we will need to use a charter company. He
noted that staff’s expectation is to have this service up and
running in the next couple of weeks.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

December 7, 2016

Subject:

DUSPA Refinancing Proposal

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain
outstanding obligations; providing for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and
approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
The Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) was established in 2008 to implement and
direct construction and improvements for the Denver Union Station Project. DUSPA is governed by a
Board of Directors comprised of appointed members from the Regional Transportation District, the
City of Denver, DRCOG, and CDOT.
In 2010, RTD entered a funding agreement with DUSPA as part of the plan of finance related to the
design, construction and renovation of the Denver Union Station project area. The funding
agreement was in the form of a bond payment from RTD to DUSPA in the amount of approximately
$12 million per year at an interest rate of 5.85% (RTD/DUSPA Bond). As a result, DUSPA was able
to use the RTD revenue along with other available revenue sources to obtain a Railroad Rehabilitation
& Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan and Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA) loan from the US Department of Transportation.
In October 2016, the DUSPA Board issued a Request for Proposals for refinancing the outstanding
DUSPA loans. DUSPA received seven responses which were reviewed by the DUSPA Board, its
financial advisor, PFM and staff from RTD and the City and County of Denver. The best proposal
was deemed to have come from a collaboration between Piper Jaffray and BBVA Compass Bank.
The proposal offers financial benefit to RTD, the City and County of Denver as well as DUSPA.
This action item discusses the refinancing of the RTD/DUSPA bond to achieve a reduction in interest
payments for RTD.
DISSCUSSION:
With the current low interest rate environment the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is
available in relation to the RTD/DUSPA bond. RTD has the opportunity to refinance the 2010
RTD/DUSPA bond with RTD FasTracks bonds and realize a substantial savings in interest payments.

Packet Pg. 103

11.A

The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to
changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The potential savings from
a refunding of the RTD/DUSPA Bond exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and prepared documentation to be in a position
to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
Due to the unique nature of the RTD/DUSPA Bond and the fact that there are multiple stakeholders
including DUSPA and the City and County of Denver, the exact timing of this transaction will be
dependent on the ability of all involved parties to coordinate a simultaneous closing, as required by
the RRIF and TIFIA loans. It is expected that this will be achievable during the first half of 2017.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Piper Jaffray, Stifel Nicholaus, Harvestons Securities and DA Davidson.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional
Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing for other
matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution and
delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2017, authorizing the issuance of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the
Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to retire certain outstanding obligations; providing
for other matters related to such bonds and the security therefor; and approving the execution
and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject:

Refunding 2007A FT Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain
outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds and the security
therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.
BACKGROUND:
In 2007, RTD issued its Series 2007A FasTracks bonds to refinance a portion of the Series 2006A
FasTracks bonds. The original proceeds from this financing were used to partially fund construction
of various FasTracks projects including, US36, West Line and EAGLE.
This action item discusses the refinancing of a portion of the currently outstanding Series 2007A
FasTracks bonds to achieve a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $363.725 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2007A (the
“2007 Bonds”) in 2007 for the purpose of refinancing a portion of the Series 2006A FasTracks
bonds for interest savings. In 2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725
million of the $600 million 2006A Bonds to capture $11.373 million in present value savings
(3.122% of principal of refunded bonds).
With the current low interest rate environment and the approaching November 1, 2017 call date on
the series 2007A bonds, the opportunity to refinance for interest savings is available. RTD has the
opportunity to advance refund a portion of the outstanding 2007A Bonds to realize, subject to
market movement, a savings of approximately $5.8 million (4.2% of principal of refunded bonds) on
a tax-exempt basis. The Bond Resolution requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some
flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold. The
2007A Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding
bonds and optional redemption date of the 2007 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time

Packet Pg. 121

11.B

proceeds of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2007 Bonds. Despite the
cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2007
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the
opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and
the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to
authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with
the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Butler Snow LLP as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, US Bancorp, Loop Capital, Harvestons Securities and George K Baum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out
of Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
printing fees.

not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

Subject:

Refunding 2002A COP

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery
by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the refinancing
of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
BACKGROUND:
In 2002, RTD issued its Series 2002A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 34 new Siemens
light rail vehicles and partially fund the Elati light rail maintenance facility. The amount financed in
2002 was $132,000,000. The COPs are callable at par on November 1, 2017 and final payment is
scheduled to occur in 2022.
The remaining outstanding balance of the COPs is currently $71,400,000 and the interest rate being
paid ranges from 4.5%-5.0%.
The approaching call date and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the 2002A COPs to realize a reduction in interest payments.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD has the potential to advance-refund a portion of the remaining outstanding Series 2002A COPs
to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $4.86 million (6.81% of principal
of refunded COPs). RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of 3% savings which
allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the new
interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net
of a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to
the interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the
new financing and the November 1, 2017 call date of the 2002A COPs (negative arbitrage). Absent
a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction
in time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2002A COPs.
Despite the cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the
2002A COPs exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has
assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of
the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.

Packet Pg. 140

11.C

RTD typically uses COPs to finance vehicles when the budget cannot accommodate the use of cash
to acquire the necessary vehicles, as was the case in 2002. In this case, staff received an attractive
proposal from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for the use of lease financing to refinance the Series
2002A Certificates of Participation. As a response to this proposal, staff solicited similar proposals
from the banks in RTD’s underwriter pool. Five responses were received and reviewed by staff and
RTD’s financial advisor. It was determined that the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal offered the
most value to RTD.
Benefits of the JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. proposal include interest rates competitive with a
refinancing of the 2002A COPs with new COPs, a call option for RTD after just 12 months and the
ability to avoid the cost of obtaining credit ratings.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Series 2002A
COPs through an annually appropriated capital lease through JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.
Drafts of documents including the Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, Purchase and
Assignment Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The lender in this transaction will be
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney and miscellaneous costs. The final
payment year of the new financing will not exceed the final payment year of the existing Series
2002A COPs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016 authorizing the execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and
related documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2002A transit vehicle project. This
is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the District.

Update to the 2017 Quarterly Performance
Report

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt updated 2017 Quarterly Performance Measures to include measures for ridership,
fare revenue, total operating revenue, and commuter rail.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
The year-to-date performance measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it
provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement
objectives. In 2017, 41 performance measures will be tracked for the GM.
When the 2017 performance measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016, it was stated
the following measures would be established by the financial plans inherent in the 2017 Adopted
Budget. These measures are as follows:
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
It is recommended that the overall ridership increase for 2017 be established at 6.8%. This
assumes all ridership growth will come from FasTracks as the Base System ridership estimate for
2017 is flat over 2016. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.5%. This is the
percentage increase in total fare revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the 2016 projection.
The increase is driven by increased ridership in FasTracks as Base System ridership and fare
revenue are kept flat in 2017. This is an annual measure.
It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2017 be established at 15.9%.
This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2017 Adopted Budget over the
2016 projection, which takes into account minor items of operating revenue such as advertising,
joint venture, parking, and other miscellaneous revenue. This is an annual measure.
Goal 6.4 – Monitor Selected Internal Functions for Efficiency
The goal for annual audits is changed for 2017 from the number of audits to the percentage
completion of the Annual Audit Plan per Board approval on 11/29/16. The goal for percentage
completion is 100%.
Commuter Rail
It was noted when the 2017 Performance Measures were adopted by the Board in April 2016 that
a performance protocol was being developed for commuter rail linked to the concessionaire
agreement with DTP and that measures to be tracked in 2017 would be brought to the Board at a
later date for review. The following measurement criteria have been developed:

Packet Pg. 152

11.D

Goal 1.5 – Reduce the Number of Commuter Rail Accidents
It is recommended that a new goal be added to measure the number of reportable preventable
commuter rail accidents per 100,000 train miles. The measure is the same as for light rail in
preceding Goal 1.4.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On Time Performance
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 90.0% which is the same as light rail
on-time service. The on-time definition for commuter rail is departure from a location no more
than 0 minutes early or 5 minutes after the scheduled departure time.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain System-Wide Service Availability
It is recommended that a goal for commuter rail be added of 97.0% which is lower than light rail
service available because of additional FRA requirements that must be followed to bring commuter rail
cars into service. The measure is calculated as actual car miles operated divided by total scheduled
car miles.

Subject:

Approval of Financial Advisor Selection

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to First
Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as
defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) not to exceed $600,000 over a maximum of 5
years.
BACKGROUND:
Financial advisor services are necessary to complete the issuance and refinancing of bonds and
certificates of participation. Their services help RTD achieve the lowest cost of capital available in
the market by providing guidance on appropriate pricing of bonds and certificates of participation and
assisting in the management of credit rating agency relations. Additionally, investment banks are no
longer allowed to discuss financing or refinancing ideas with local governments unless the local
government has retained a Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission.
DISSCUSSION:
In October 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for financial advisory services. Proposals
were received from three firms and the proposals were reviewed by a review committee of 5 RTD
employees. The three firms that responded to RTD’s RFP included First Southwest, PFM and George
K. Baum.
Proposals were reviewed by the review committee and judged based on a best value to RTD basis.
It was determined that the First Southwest proposal offered the most value to RTD.
Benefits of the First Southwest proposal include an in depth understanding the existing RTD capital
structure, existing RTD debt and other financial obligations, constraints and priorities of RTD. The
Fees of all three proposals were judged to be competitive with each other.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act
as financial advisor (and Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to
RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the contract will be paid for with local funds. The contract will be for three
years with two optional one-year extensions. The cost of the contract for a full five years would be

Packet Pg. 164

11.E

$600,000 ($120,000 per year). The funding for the contract was included in the 2017 adopted
budget, SBP and APE.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to
First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and Municipal
Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD.
This is the
recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to First Southwest, a division of Hill Top Securities to act as financial advisor (and
Municipal Advisor as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission) to RTD. This is not the
recommended action as it would not allow RTD to continue to manage it take advantage of
the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Naming Rights Implementation

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 8, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve transferring $144,000 from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Naming Rights
Implementation Project for signage and the 2016 commission to WME/ IMG.
BACKGROUND
On August 18, 2015, see attached, the Board of Director’s approved the sponsorship naming right
agreement with the University of Colorado for the sponsorship naming rights on the A line and an
exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer for a five-year period with a mutually agreed upon right
to extend this agreement for an additional five years.
Over the initial five-year period, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.
It was
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Appropriated Reserve. In the
first year of the agreement, a portion of the funds would be utilized for the implementation and
activation of the naming rights partner benefits including signage and updating of collateral materials. In
addition, the agent WME/IMG is entitled per contract to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenues.
DISCUSSION
The request will fund signs and the 2016 WME/ IMG commission. Attached as an addendum to this
report is the engineering diagram for the proposed signs. This design has been arrived at following
discussions with project engineers and facilities management staff about other options such as: signs on
railing, signs on windscreens and/or banners on light poles at each station platform; all of which resulted
in uncovering the fact that these other options did not meet engineering specifications for max wind
load [creating safety concerns] and being in conflict with RTD’s Art in Transit program.
These standalone signs are intended to be placed near the leading end of the platform in the direction of
travel. [e.g. western end of the west bound side and eastern end of the eastbound side]. There are to be
(2) signs per station [one per platform]. Content for these signs will be created by Univ. of Colorado.
RTD is responsible for the initial installation and maintenance. CU will responsible for subsequent
content changes; up to 4 changes per year per the rights and benefits associated with the naming rights
agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact as those funds were placed in the Board Appropriated Fund to pay for
implementation and activation of the naming right partner benefits including signage and updating of
collateral materials. The agent WME/IMG is entitled to an annual payment of 12% of gross revenue.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the staff’s recommendation and complete the installation of signage and pay the annual
commission.

Packet Pg. 166

11.F

2. Do not accept the staff’s recommendation. If we don’t complete our requirements under
the contract it will jeopardize the ability to receive the remaining funds estimated at
approximately $4.5 million.

Audit Charter

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amended Audit Charter.
BACKGROUND
The Audit Charter is a formal document that defines the audit division’s activity, purpose, authority and
responsibility. It establishes Audit’s position within the organization, including reporting relationship
with the Board, authorizes access to records, personnel and physical properties relevant to performance
of engagements and defines the scope of audit activities. Final approval of the Audit Charter resides
with the Board.
DISCUSSION
The Audit function is engaged in Internal Audits and IT Audits, using either one of the function names
excludes the other so Audit will henceforth be referred to as RTD Audit, to be all inclusive.
The Scope of work has been expanded to include IT Audits and Investigations both of which Audit has
engaged in, but were not included in the previous Audit Charter.
The Independence and Accountability changes include adding the governing body for IT Auditing Information Systems Audit and Control Association, ISACA and eliminating the administrative reporting
requirement in line with the change of reporting responsibility to the General Manager and CEO, effective
January 2017.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached amended Audit Charter.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the amended Audit Charter. This action
is not recommended. RTD Audit is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity
designed to add value and improve RTD's operations. The Audit Charter provides the foundation
upon which the Audit Activity is based; without which Audit could be deprived of independence
and objectivity.

Annual Audit Plan 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Annual Audit Plan for 2017.
BACKGROUND
The Annual Audit Plan has historically been approved by the General Manager and CEO and the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The Annual Audit Plan for 2017 includes several IT Audits and Internal Audits. The plan also includes
Follow-up Audits and a section containing Audit Requests that have not been prioritized for 2017.
The Annual Audit Plan is based on estimates of the time to complete the audits. As in past years it
utilizes every available business day. If time becomes available during the year Audit will refer to the
Board for approval of audits to be included as replacements.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Annual Audit Plan as presented. This is the recommended action. This will allow
Audit to complete the audit process in a timely manner.
2. Do not approve the Annual Audit Plan. This is not recommended. This Audit Plan was developed
after carefully selecting audits according to their potential to improve RTD’s policies and
procedures and contribute to the Goals and Objectives of the District. Delaying approval could
limit the days available for auditing and thereby reduce overall audit presence in the District.

DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support for the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 189

11.I

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
122 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies operating vanpool services in other metropolitan
areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program. VPSI took
over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.4 riders
per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2016 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per
passenger seat used of approximately $4.52 and $2.94 for each seat sold. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.66 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.18 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $5.17 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2017 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

5311 Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2017 and for amounts
not to exceed $372,232.00 for Boulder County, $366.026.00 for Adams County and $113,411.00 for
Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).
Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has
provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties
since 1993.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $372,232.00 in 2017. RTD shall also contribute
funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in
amount not to exceed $366,026.00 in 2017.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $113,411.00.00 in 2017.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service in 2015 resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour

Packet Pg. 191

11.J

and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.29 to approximately
$5.59 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.0 passengers per hour in 2015 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $19.26 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $42.92 in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00.

BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,454,514.00 in 2017. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP
performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have
been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will
be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance does not
warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order
to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2016 resulted in 24.3
passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger trip of $1.77. For comparison, the
boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of 32.6 boardings per hour
for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service.

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for
an amount not to exceed $311,356.00.

BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the management
and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related expenses.
The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of
Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged a RTD
fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 636.0 boardings per day or 25.5 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $311,356 in 2017
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.5 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.29. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route suburban service in 2015 was 17.7 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $7.18 per boarding.
The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.

Authorization to enter into contract with
Nordco Mobile Railcar Movers (16DR004)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar
Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00.
BACKGROUND:
When RTD prepared to open the first Light Rail line in 1994, we purchased a 1984 Mercedes-Benz
Unimog to move single LRVs in rail yards and on rail lines that did not yet have overhead power. This
type of vehicle was the Industry standard for moving LRVs in rail yards across the country. RTD also
used this vehicle to tow LRVs on new lines for clearance and overhead wire position testing. RTD
learned that the Unimog was not large enough to efficiently and safely tow our 88,000 lb. LRV’s on 6%
percent grades and the tight curves that exist on our rail lines. Having a Brakeman on board the LRV is
the only way to tow safely and still doesn’t solve the lack of towing effort needed to go up steep
grades.
RTD initially issued a Request for Proposals on August 26, 2016. Evaluative criteria were cost- 50%,
conformance with specifications- 30%, supplier’s history and proven track record with this equipment10%, and quality of references- 10%. RTD’s evaluation committee consisted of Robbie Hunter, Senior
Equipment Engineer; Phil Eberl, General Superintendent, LRV Maintenance; Tim Walker, Manager, LRV
Maintenance; and Leo Fautsch, Senior Buyer.
RTD received two proposals; one from Nordco and one from Colmar. The evaluation committee
recommends Nordco, the proposer that met our specification and was the only one that met our
evaluation criteria.
DISCUSSION:
A larger rail car mover is the only feasible way to recover trains from the mainline and to tow LRVs. This
mover will also be used by our Maintenance of Way group to tow their ballast car as needed. The
proposed mover could retrieve two to four LRVs at a time.
It will have a 30,000lb winch installed to aid in derailment retrievals and couplers for LRV retrieval. Most
Light Rail properties in the U.S. have a larger LRV mover capable of towing multiple LRVs in the event of
a major accident or power failure on the line in order to recover their trains and return them to the rail
yard.
The existing Unimog is obsolete, undersized and almost impossible to purchase parts for due to its age.
A newer model of the same vehicle is not available in the U.S. due to EPA regulations. The proposed
vehicle exceeds the tractive effort (pulling power) of common Track Mobiles.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the Recovery Vehicle is in the Rail Operations capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar

Packet Pg. 197

11.M

Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Nordco for
purchase of a Railcar Mover. This action would result in RTD’s inability to efficiently and safely
retrieve LRVs on rail lines absent of overhead power and could not be shared by MOW for the
movement of their ballast car. This is not the recommended action as it would not allow us to
improve our ability to efficiently move or recover LRVs on dead track sections.

Code of Conduct for Persons on RTD Vehicles
and Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Code of Conduct for persons on RTD vehicles and property.
BACKGROUND:
Since its founding, RTD has not had a written code of conduct that describes acceptable behavior for
individuals on RTD vehicles and property. Many other transit agencies including Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Dallas, and New York City have such codes to promote public safety, health, and peace. Codes help
passengers and visitors understand acceptable behavior, and help transit agencies communicate and, if
necessary, enforce such behavior.
A 2016 RTD Leadership Academy group has been working on a campaign to educate RTD users on
courtesy to fellow passengers, to help make everyone’s ride more enjoyable. While working on this
project the Leadership Academy group identified the need for RTD to have a formal Code of Conduct.
RTD currently has a Facilities Use Policy posted on RTD’s website. However, that policy applies solely to
RTD real property, and focuses mainly on commercial activity and First Amendment issues concerning
non-commercial activity. RTD’s Trailblazer contains requirements for passenger conduct, but the
Trailblazer is an operator’s guide, not instructions to the public. Historically, verbal guidance and
directions from RTD security and staff have sufficed to maintain acceptable behavior, but recently RTD
Transit Police officers have been challenged to “show me the rule” when they ask patrons to refrain
from disruptive activities. The attached Code of Conduct will provide clear and consistent answers and
guidance to RTD Transit Police, other RTD staff, and RTD patrons.
The Code has been written to avoid infringing on the public’s First Amendment rights, and to respect the
rights of disabled persons under the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Code restricts
disruptively loud noises or unsanitary practices, but does not try to regulate what people say or wear.
The Code also emphasizes that it is subject to reasonable modification if otherwise prohibited conduct is
due to a disability, and directs RTD staff to consult with RTD Dispatch or Security for advice in such
cases.
The Code reflects that RTD does not intend to use it to punish violations. Instead, RTD will continue to
enforce its standards of behavior in a compassionate and sensible manner, with an emphasis on
education and warnings whenever it is practicable to do so. If a patron violates the Code and refuses to
stop even after a warning, or in extreme cases where immediate action must be taken without a prior
warning, the Code will aid RTD Transit Police and other staff to direct the patron to leave the premises
or face trespassing charges.

Packet Pg. 199

11.N

The Code does not alter or replace existing applicable laws, such as criminal violations for “Endangering
Public Transportation,” “Hindering Public Transportation,” and assault.
RTD has developed the Code after review of similar codes by peer transit agencies including those
mentioned above, and with input from the Senior Leadership Team, RTD’s Civil Rights Division, and
other RTD staff. An initial draft of the Code was provided to the Operations Committee on November 1,
2016 for review and comment. The Code has also undergone substantial outreach with stakeholder
groups, including input sought from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, the Colorado CrossDisability Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Downtown Denver Business Improvement
District, and other local entities. Numerous suggestions by these groups have been included in the final
draft.
Rollout, education and publicity on the Code is anticipated to be done in conjunction with the Leadership
Academy education program.
The Code will be posted on RTD’s website and made available in pamphlet form, and RTD security and
operations staff will be trained in its provisions and enforcement. RTD staff will also educate individuals
on the Code while performing ongoing security, operations and maintenance functions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The cost to implement the Code of Conduct will be very minimal, and a Code will help protect RTD
against legal claims based on arbitrary RTD conduct.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is
recommended, because RTD staff needs a comprehensive code of conduct to educate the public
and, if necessary, enforce appropriate behavior.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is not
recommended, since RTD will continue to have no written, easy to find, and easy to apply rules
governing behavior of RTD passengers and others; and legal challenges may be filed against RTD
staff issuing directives not based on written policies.

RTD Code of Conduct
for Persons on RTD Vehicles, Facilities or Property
December 20, 2016

RTD desires to meet our constituents’ present and future public transportation needs by offering
safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.
For the safety, convenience, and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of
Conduct (Code) setting forth rules prohibiting certain conduct that may in RTD’s sole
determination adversely affect use, operation or occupancy of RTD vehicles (including RTD
buses, access-a-Ride vehicles, call-n-Ride vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail
vehicles), facilities (including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters,
plazas and fountains, and administrative, operational and maintenance facilities), or property.
Any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement ranging from a
verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5:
“Enforcement”). Prohibited conduct is subject to reasonable modification under the Americans
with Disabilities Act (see Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”).
2. Authority:
This Code of Conduct was approved on December 20, 2016 by RTD’s Board of Directors.
3. Prohibited Conduct:
A person (including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever, including but not
limited to companies, clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is
prohibited from committing, attempting to commit, or assisting any other person or combination
of persons to commit, the following acts on any RTD vehicle, at any RTD facility, or on RTD
property unless otherwise specified in this Section:
Fares / Locations
1. Using any RTD services without prior payment of the proper fare.
2. Being within any RTD fare paid zone without prior payment of the proper fare.

(CRS 18-9-114), and endangering public transportation (CRS 18-9-115).
53. Failure to obey any directive from an RTD employee or representative related to
RTD operations. For example, RTD’s Trailblazer Operators Guide contains many
procedures and requirements related to ADA policies, including wheelchair
securement, boarding with strollers and other large items, passenger locations on
vehicles, and other topics.
4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) transportation entities are required to make
reasonable modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and
ensure that their programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this
directive RTD will make every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person
with a disability has access to, and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable
modifications to its policies, programs, and procedures applicable to its transportation services,
when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure accessibility for people with disabilities.
There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and procedures do not achieve ADA
objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures may be needed to
ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of reasonable
modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making a
reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
•Create undue financial and administrative burdens
•Constitute a fundamental alteration to a service
•Be more than necessary to provide equal access to an RTD service

Attachment: 2016-12-06 Code of Conduct AS AMENDED 2016-12-13 (2978 : Code of Conduct)

49. Spitting, urinating or defecating other than in facilities intended for such purposes.

Any questions or concerns on reasonable modification should be directed to RTD’s Division of
Civil Rights, ADA Managers Office: 303-299-2221.

5. Enforcement:

If violations of this Code of Conduct appear or are claimed to be caused by
a disability, RTD personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice
and assistance.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may be warned and/or ordered to
immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility, or property by an RTD Transit Police Officer, an RTD
Transit Security Officer, an RTD Bus/Light Rail/Commuter Rail Line Supervisor, or other
authorized RTD personnel. Such personnel are authorized to issue an order to the person to exit
RTD property for up to the remainder of the service day.
Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility or property after being
ordered to do so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement
personnel.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may also, or instead, be issued a
suspension by RTD, suspending the person from all RTD vehicles, properties and services for a
determined amount of time pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy and procedures.
A person ordered to leave or suspended from RTD property will not be entitled to any refund of
unused fare media that may expire during the time of the person’s exclusion.
Suspension or orders to exit RTD property may be appealed pursuant to RTD’s Service
Suspension policy and procedures.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, riding an RTD vehicle without evidence
that the proper fare has been paid may be treated in accordance with Colorado Traffic Code 424-1416.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, illegal activity may result in citation under
any applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation or ordinance, including Colorado State
Statutes 18-9-114 - Hindering Transportation (Class 2 Misdemeanor), and CRS 18-9-115 Endangering Public Transportation and Utility Transmission (Class 3 Felony).

This Code of Conduct does not seek to limit, replace, or conflict with any
federal, state, or local law, regulation or ordinance, and does not limit or
prevent any law enforcement agency or entity from taking any lawful
action against any person on any RTD vehicle, facility, or property.

Attachment: 2016-12-06 Code of Conduct AS AMENDED 2016-12-13 (2978 : Code of Conduct)

RTD will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act in the administration of this Code of Conduct.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 29, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 29, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services with CRL
Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019), at a cost of
$102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the
Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors pursuant to the
Contract Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders looked at the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel is
recommending to the Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s
Local Government Liaison with the elected officials and staff of the cities and counties of the Denver
metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic development organizations. This
team has broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns, as well as an extensive network of
relationships with local governments, elected officials, and stakeholders along the Front Range. The
proposal was submitted for the period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, with the
potential for two (2) one-year option periods. The Government Relations Committee will make future
annual recommendations to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the
exercise of future option periods.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for 2017 is included in the annual budget and future years will be included in the respective
annual budgets.

12.O

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services
with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019),
at a cost of $102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices
specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to
interested parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local
government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.
This option is also not recommended because a valid RFP process was utilized for this
procurement.

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 29, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for federal liaison services with Squire Patton
Boggs LLP to exercise a one-year option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) to extend
Contract No. 14-DX-001, at a cost of $264,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017
budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014.
The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract
for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and has assisted
in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant monitoring of
Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special reports are prepared
when significant events occur in the federal government.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process. In addition, in 2016 RTD received a $92 million Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), which entailed extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts were required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded the
annual appropriations in the current Eagle P3 FFGA, as well as procuring the SERE FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expired on May 31, 2015, and the federal lobbyists played a key role
in representing RTD’s needs in the new authorization bill—Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act
(FAST Act). With the build out of FasTracks, the lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the
federal financing needs for the unfunded corridors, and they will monitor the possibility of new funding
sources in the FAST Act and advocate for RTD’s best interests.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.

Packet Pg. 210

12.P

For the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative Conference in March each year,
Squire Patton Boggs staff advises which offices are critical to visit or are of relevant interest for
board/staff visits. Then, the Squire Patton Boggs team sets the meeting times on behalf of RTD.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a one-year
option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) at a cost of $264,000 ($22,000 per
month) with Squire Patton Boggs LLP.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement.

William C. Van Meter,

Date:

November 30, 2016

Subject:

Option to Purchase Real Property at 29072915 Welton Street

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
for the grant of an option, and for the sale of the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street,
Denver Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance
documents.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2016 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets by selling property
no longer needed by the District for fair market value, and addresses the policy goals of Resolution 17 in
2010, the TOD Strategic Plan by supporting creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD originally acquired the property at 29th and Welton in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for local
businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central Corridor LRT. The property is currently a
vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s parking
management system.
In 2010, the RTD Board adopted the TOD Strategic Plan to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementing the new TOD Strategic Plan. Pursuant to that
policy direction, RTD selected the Welton corridor as a Pilot Program site because of a combination of
favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s (the “City’s”)
commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor including activation of RTD’s
29th and Welton property. The plan emphasizes the need to retain housing affordability in the Welton
corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED) began discussions
around how to partner to implement the community vision established in the Five Points Business
District plan as part of the RTD Pilot Program implementation. In addition, Mayor Hancock has signaled
his eagerness to continue to collaborate with RTD on a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction that helps to achieve the City’s 3x5 Initiative to create or preserve 3,000 affordable homes
in five years by 2018. A letter from Mayor Hancock expressing the City’s commitment to this project is
included in the Board packet, including the City’s willingness to contribute substantial gap financing to
support an appropriate development on the 29th and Welton site.

Packet Pg. 212

12.Q

RTD and the City have outlined a potential competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixedincome condominium project on the Property. OED would lead the RFQ process, but RTD would
participate in the selection panel. To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD
and the City need to establish certainty for potential bidders that the property will be available at
previously agreed upon terms. Accordingly, RTD staff request authority to grant an option to purchase
the Property now so that when the City issues the RFQ, it can represent that it holds a right to purchase
the property under the terms of an option agreement.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to grant the City and County of Denver an option to purchase the
Property1. In order to exercise the option and complete the purchase, the following conditions must be
met first:
i) successful procurement of a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project according to the terms agreed upon by RTD and the City;
ii) the selected developer reaching an agreement on business terms with the City; and
iii) the selected developer securing the financing necessary to complete the project.
The City would also have the right to assign the option to the selected developer, meaning the selected
developer could purchase the property directly from RTD on the same terms as the City and subject to
the same conditions. The term of the option would be two years from the date of its execution, with
the ability to grant two ninety-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction. The final
purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of the Property.
If the City fails to exercise the option during the option period, RTD would remain the property owner
and any subsequent decisions about the Property would come back to the Board for approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,000 per year maintaining the property. If the property is sold,
RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation. If the Option is exercised, RTD will receive the
amount determined by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee
to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of an option, and for the sale of
the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver Colorado (the “Property”),
including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary for the conveyance of an Option to Purchase the Real Property located at 2907-2915
Welton Street, Denver CO. This is not recommended because RTD does not have any current or
future transit need for the property, and because this would be inconsistent with the goals of the
TOD pilot program previously approved by the Board in December of 2010.

An option to purchase property is the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the property at any time
during the term of the option according to the terms of the option.

Subject:

Summary of Proposed Option terms for 291h and Welton TOD Pilot Project

Planning~~l:fM~;>

G~eneral Manager & CEO

The following memo summarizes the issues addressed in the December 6, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee, and provides a point by point summary of the items outlined in the Board
Report regarding the terms of the proposed option.

Staff recommends this approach as striking a

balance between multiple policy goals, and as a means to continue the partnership and working
relationship with the City of Denver established in 2010. This approach also seeks to balance limiting
the number of constraints placed on an actual transaction to allow the District to maximize revenue and
simplify negotiations, while still protecting the District by insuring the land is not sold if the developer
procurement process and negotiations (both led by City of Denver) are unsuccessful.
Governing Policies:
•

2016 District Goal of Fiscal Sustainability

•

2010 Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution Only Attached) and 2010 Pilot Program

Goals & Obiectives:
•

Leverage RTD assets through sale of non-transit property at appraised Fair Market Value.

•

Encourage creation of mixed income communities near transit through partnership with
Denver's Office of Economic Development. RTD's partnership with the City of Denver (both
Community Planning and Development and Office of Economic Development) to bring forward a
project meeting City and RTD goals extends back to 2010, over 6 years.

•

Promote cooperation with other stakeholders, and leverage public I public partnerships to meet
strategic goals.

12.Q.a

•

Denver's Office of Economic Development ("OED") leads RFQ process for development partner
for a mixed-income condominium project. RTD participates in the RFQ selection process.
o

OED is prepared to commit substantial funding to cover the gap between units priced
for households making 80%-100% of Area Median Income.
•

A buyer making 80% of AMI can afford a 1 bedroom unit priced at $170,000.

•

1 bedroom market-rate units in downtown Denver are priced starting in the low
$300,000's.

o

OED has committed that the RFQ will require that a minimum of 25% of units be
income-restricted to buyers at 80-100% of AMI, and that preference will be given to
respondents who propose developing a project with a higher proportion of affordable
units.

•

RTD grants an option to buy the property to OED. OED may only purchase the property if it
meets certain conditions (see Option Terms below).

•

If those conditions are met, OED may choose to either buy the property directly or assign the
option to buy to the selected developer on the same terms. Allowing assignment of the option
to the selected developer will allow OED, if they choose, to bring forward all the proposed terms
to Denver City Council as a single package for Council approval.

•

If the OED does not exercise the option, RTD will keep the property. The reasons why OED
would not be able to exercise the option are if:
•

RFQ is unsuccessful (ie-no qualified responses); or

•

OED is unable to reach agreement with the selected developer on the amount
of subsidy OED will provide; or

•

the selected developer cannot secure lender financing to build the proposed
project.

•

RTD's grant of an option to OED simplifies the process because the selected developer
negotiates all business terms directly with OED.

•

RTD's grant of an option creates certainty for respondents to the RFQ that the property will be
available at previously agreed on terms.

•

Simplification and certainty of process are more likely to result in a successful RFQ solicitation.

Some of the key option terms:
Length of Option:
•

2 years from execution.

Two 90 day extensions (at RTD's discretion) if needed to

complete the transaction . For example, if all terms have been negotiated, and the
developer is awaiting finalizing documents with a lender, an extension could be granted

Proposed Transaction Structure:

Page 2 of 3

Packet Pg. 216

12.Q.a

OED could seek an extension from the RTD Board of Directors who would have to
approve the extension.
Option Price:
•

Fair Market Value based on appraisal. Per standard RTD policy, if the option is not
exercised within 6 months of the appraisal date, the appraisal must be updated.

Conditions for exercising or assigning the Option:
•

Successful procurement of a developer who commits to build a mixed-income
condominium project with a minimum of 25% units at 80-100% AMI.

•

OED and the selected developer reach an agreement on business terms for the amount
of subsidy required to build the project.

•

The selected developer secures the financing necessary to complete the project.

•

OED may assign the option only to the selected developer, and only if all of these
conditions are met; or

•

OED may exercise the option directly only if all of these conditions are met.

Process for exercising the Option:
•

OED or se lected developer provides written notice that the conditions have been met,
and delivers the purchase price (appraised value} to RTD .

•

RTD delivers the deed to the property to OED or the selected developer.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve an option agreement between RTD and the city to acquire the
RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton Street for the development of mixed-income
housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) has been working
closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented Development team to plan for the development of
mixed-income for-sale housing on this site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on
this joint effort to provide critical affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Points
neighborhood.
OED’s mission is to advance economic prosperity for the city and its businesses, neighborhoods
and residents. As part of this mission, OED invests federal and local funds in the development
and preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, OED
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, OED invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
Attachment: 2016-11-28 Letter - RTD Board - 29th Welton (2976 : 2907-2915 Welton Street)

We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.

12.Q.e

Economic & Planning Systems, Inc.

Economic & Planning Systems (EPS) evaluated two land disposition options for the RTD owned
parcels at 29th and Welton. The site is currently used as a RTD parking lot. The first option is a
land sale, where RTD transfers ownership to a buyer in exchange for a lump sum payment. The
second is a ground lease, where a land lessee pays RTD a fee to use the land for a set term. At
the end of the term, RTD takes control of the land and any buildings on it. EPS evaluated the
disposition options on two criteria: (1) the potential limitations on land uses and corresponding
policy goals and (2) the potential monetary value to RTD. In the first criterion, the evaluation
found that the ground lease option limits the potential for residential product in general and
likely precludes residential homeownership. In the second, the evaluation found that the land
sale and ground lease generate similar values.

Land Use Limitations
The ground lease option poses distinct challenges as it relates to housing affordability goals.
Ground leases generally preclude residential ownership products like condominiums. As a result,
this disposition option would limit RTD’s ability to create affordable homeownership on the site.
Moreover, ground leases often increase the interest rate on mortgages for potential buyers,
further complicating affordability. Finally, the market for residential ground leases limits the pool
of prospective developers, creating an additional layer of complexity for lenders and investors. A
weak ground lease market may also reduce the potential value of this option.

Value
In addition to policy considerations, EPS estimated the potential value to RTD for both options.
Based on conservative assumptions, EPS found the option yield almost identical values for RTD
of approximately $1.4 million. The valuation methodology is described briefly:
•

•

Land Sale: EPS evaluated 26 comparable land sales within a one-mile radius of the site
completed since 2010. Based on these comparable transactions, a low, moderate, and
high range of price was established. Based on these prices, EPS estimates a price range
between $1 million and $1.7, with $1.4 million representing the mid-range estimate.
Ground Lease: EPS calculated a present value of the potential stream of cash flows. In
contrast to a land sale, a ground lease tenant pays RTD an annual fee to use the land.
The fee is typically based on a percentage of the land value (around 6.0 percent), and
ground leases typically last 50 or 99 years, with the latter being more common. The long
term nature of the lease allows the tenant to earn a return on any investment or land
improvement. Present value allows for apples-to-apples comparison, translating the
stream of cash values into 2016 dollars. Based on these terms, EPS estimates a range of
values between $1 million and 1.7 million, with a midrange of $1.4 million.

While the two options generate comparable values in most scenarios, EPS found more upside to
ground leases in optimistic scenarios. However, RTD must balance this potential premium with
the policy limitations and market constraints posed by the ground lease. In other words, the
objective of developing affordable ownership condominiums can be accomplished most
effectively with a land sale.

Subject:

Parking Guiding Principles

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on parking related
issues moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has over 29,000 parking spaces serving its transit system. About 20 percent of RTD riders park at
one of RTD’s park and ride facilities to access the transit system so it represents a significant contingent
of RTD’s ridership. RTD’s ability to manage our parking resources is governed by RTD’s enabling
legislation (C.R.S. Section 32-9-119.9) and there is limited internal policy guidance available for staff to
utilize in analyzing and making decisions on parking related projects.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s recent experience with third party parking agreements has resulted in inconsistencies in the
management and operation of shared facilities. This inconsistency creates challenges for RTD staff to
implement RTD’s current parking management program and complicates issues when considering third
party approaches to potentially charging for parking.
For joint development projects, there is limited guidance in RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010) about
how to deal with replacement parking. It would benefit staff to have clearly identified criteria to
consider when working on projects involving parking replacement. In addition, RTD’s approach to station
access, which includes the provision of parking, is done with limited policy guidance. Having clear
policy guidance on station access would help with in developing a holistic, balanced approach to the
planning and implementation of station improvements.
It would therefore be beneficial to have guiding principles to provide a base level of direction to staff in
day to day dealings with parking issues. Draft parking guiding principles were presented at the
November 1st P&D Committee meeting. Board feedback on the draft principles was provided at the
meeting.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to RTD parking.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on
parking related issues moving forward.
2. Do not adopt resolution. Continue to operate with limited policy guidance and allow for
continued inconsistency with parking decisions.

Approval
of
General
Performance Evaluation

Manager's

2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s performance appraisal for 2016 as defined in the
attached completed General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form. Although the Board feels you
have achieved or exceeded your overall goals for the 2016 Performance Appraisal, with current public
perception and extenuating circumstances with launch of the Commuter rail along with the challenges
with Smart Card implementation the recommendation is not to award a discretionary payout for 2016.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs at the beginning of each year for the following year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
salaried employee performance evaluation form that is used by the rest of the RTD employees. That
process was used in the 2016 GM performance appraisal process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have moved through the process of the 2016 performance evaluation utilizing the policies set on July
10, 2010 through a recommendation by the State Audit Committee.
DISCUSSION
Listed below are the 2016 Core and Task goals the General Manager was evaluated against along with
the Self and Committee Assessment results.

Dave:
The end of the year brings much reflection and introspection. The Board of Directors
would like to acknowledge your contributions and invite reflection on your
accomplishments in 2016.
Your responsibilities as General Manager and Chief Executive Officer are enormous. We
want you to know that you’re not alone – we share those responsibilities with you – We
ARE One Team, One Voice, One Mission. Of course, we don’t share those responsibilities
equally. You are the figurehead and most visible leader of this Agency. As a Board, we
are primarily responsible to set policy, but more importantly, to support and encourage
your efforts in implementing those policies.
Overall, this Board is satisfied in your performance this year. By all accounts, you are
pleasant to work with, honest in your personal communications and respected in your
expertise. Your thoughtful evaluation of every situation inspires trust and confidence,
both in you, personally, and for the Agency as a whole.
As the new General Manager/CEO, you’ve had the benefit of continuing policies and
programs previously started by your predecessors. We have noted some improvements
in some of those areas, due to your unique administration. Given a full year as General
Manager/CEO, we anticipate seeing more improvements as your individual leadership
style manifests.
You have had significant challenges this year in financing, workforce shortages,
implementation of technology and the implementation of the Commuter rail. We are
pleased to hear a frank and honest discussion of this Agency’s financial position and a
move towards a “pay as you go” model. The realization that RTD cannot continue to
accrue debt is important and a positive shift in philosophy. The most critical challenges
have been the failure to implement the SmartCard technology and the issues with the
University of Colorado A Line. You are well aware of this Board’s frustration regarding
the SmartCard technology. While you have taken positive steps to hold Xerox
accountable, we remain impatient for a resolution. Too much time and too much money
has been spent on this implementation and we look to you to convey strongly our sense
of urgency on this issue.

Along those same lines, the University of Colorado A Line and the W line problems which
have resulted in the delayed opening of the G Line and the delay of the R Line are
paramount. We understand and appreciate your efforts to solve the problems, but need
to be included in a more significant way. While we know that you are busy trying to
resolve the issues, most of us feel as though we’ve not been kept informed of what is
going on, especially regarding the delay in opening the G and R lines. More frequent
communications to the Board are requested.
In closing, we want to remind you that this Board stands firmly beside you. While we
have expressed our expectations, applause and constructive criticism, we realize that
nothing and no one is perfect, everyone and everything can be improved. Having clear
lines of frequent, candid, communication facilitates that process and benefits everyone,
especially the Regional Transportation District.
The comments contained were solicited from the entire Board and express our sincerest
thanks and most grateful appreciation for your ongoing service to this Agency and this
District. You’ve shown us, here at home and on a national level, this is not “just a job” for
you.
Very truly yours,

Some unfinished challenges are the SmartCard implementation and the delay in the retrofitting of light rail vehicles for ADA compliance.
It is no secret that this Board is enormously frustrated with the implementation of the SmartCard technology. The contractor has
stonewalled this project for too many years and too many dollars. We appreciate the steps you’ve taken to advance the completion of
this project, including the issuance of a Notice to Cure, and we remain hopeful (but impatient!) for complete resolution in the near term.
Most notable of your challenges this year are the ongoing issues with the University of Colorado A and B lines, compelling the delay in
the opening of the G line. This has colored not only public opinion of the Agency, but the Board’s as well. I probably don’t need to
remind you that all eyes are now on RTD. We are accustomed to being lauded as the leader and innovator in the transit community. We
are, and have been, the standard bearer of all that is new and untried. With minor exception, we are, and have been, successful. Now
we are placed in the uncomfortable position of having major problems and all are anxious to learn how RTD will rise to the challenge,
respond to the setback, promoting lessons learned and an industry standard in the process.
Truthful, frequent and timely communication is the Key. The Board recognizes your most difficult situation. We see your efforts to
negotiate with DTO/DTP and the myriad of public and private entities. We’d like to see a more concerted effort to get ahead of the news
cycle. It is this Board’s opinion that more frequent communication would go a long way to restore public opinion and confidence in the
University of Colorado A and B line’s operations.

That being said, it is incredible to note the amazing service levels of both of these lines. The subtlety in messaging is to highlight this
overlooked fact, without using it as an apology for the shortcomings. Under your guidance, we remain confident in Staff’s ability to
achieve this complicated task.
Further, RTD’s provision of transit services for large events has been quite good. The Broncos Super Bowl Parade and 16th Street Mall
Meet in the Streets summer activities were examples of this Agency’s ability to coordinate with other public and private agencies to fill
the need. We appreciate the attention given to planning the increased frequency of these types of large events and look forward to more
“lessons learned” improvements.

COMMENTS TO JUSTIFY (if NI or EE):
Anyone who has attended an American Public Transportation Association (APTA) conference can see how RTD is treated. With
respect. This is a clear indication that RTD maintains strong and ethical leadership. Some of the recent awards RTD has received are
indicative of that as well. This achievement speaks not only to how the General Manager is performing, but mostly about how the
Agency is performing.
Some examples of this are RTD’s candid communications with its stakeholders. Staff has done a good job explaining issues, and it
should be noted that the City of Aurora has nothing but the highest praise for RTD. The leadership and professional development
programs within RTD are paying off and employee morale is high. The hiring challenges have been approached honestly and the Board
and stakeholders were kept informed. The resultant increase in bus drivers, mechanics and light rail operators is testament to that.
Everyone agrees you’ve done a great job as the Interim General Manager, but we recognize that being the “official” General Manager
is a different story. The nature of a large, public agency does not lend itself to immediate changes and we are eager to see the
expression of your individual leadership style.

COMMENTS TO JUSTIFY (if NI or EE):
Ensuring strong financial management of an Agency the size and complexity of RTD is a monumental task. The expectation of the Board
in this area is quite high, mainly due to the regularity of substantial awards recognizing RTD’s excellence in this area. Most of the Board
takes for granted that RTD has always and continues to create a budget and live within those constraints. Since the vast majority of
revenues received by RTD are received via taxpayer dollars, the scrutiny in this area is high and the Board is pleased to note
improvements. There have been challenges for you to meet this year and your most excellent staff has ably assisted.
Some additional highlights of your success in 2016 are listed below:




A New vision to the long term outcome and responsibilities of the Pension Trust Board.
RTD’s current path is shifting towards operations and maintenance while still leveraging FasTracks funding. RTD was awarded a
FTA Small Starts construction grant for the Southeast Rail Extension in the amount of $92 million.
In November 2016, RTD successfully issued $200 million of FasTracks bonds to raise capital for ongoing FasTracks projects. RTD
locked a fixed 30-year interest rate before the 2016 election and subsequent rise in interest rates. The result of this low interest
rate will financially benefit RTD for the next 30 years. Additionally, RTD is on track to successfully refinance approximately $71
million of certificates of participation for interest savings in December 2016. This refinancing has the potential to save RTD
approximately $1 million of interest expense per year through 2022.

We appreciate your efforts and applaud your brutally honest assessment of RTD’s current financial position.
Packet Pg. 238

Your recognition and efforts in working with various communities to create special accounts to appease elected officials, has gone a long
way in quelling a growing criticism of the perceived dawdling of RTD to complete FasTracks. Additionally, the negotiation of a favorable
fuel lock price will result in a savings to RTD and is a hedge against service cuts.
Many of the policies and procedures to develop strong financial management were put into place by previous General Managers, but you
have been able to advance those components to the benefit of the Agency.

COMMENTS TO JUSTIFY (if NI or EE):
Again, many of these programs were started in the past, but the Board recognizes that you have increased their efficiency. The receipt
of the Colorado Black Chamber of Commerce Corporation of the Year award and the Rocky Mountain Indian Chamber’s First Nations
Development Institute award exemplifies this.
RTD continues to be viewed as a model for workforce development. Most notably, the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program has
been adopted by other entities and utilized by the Federal Transit Administration.
The Board would like to be more informed about what the Civil Rights Department is doing and would like to see an increase in the
WIN graduation rates. This department’s services should not be limited solely to Denver; service to all areas of the District is
encouraged.
Some positive milestones for Civil Rights are:
 The successful implementation of the EEO Software
 Added and trained an EEO Specialist
 The ADA involvement in the reconfiguration of the light rail cars for accessibility
 The efforts by the ADA Office in recognizing service animals and training staff appropriately.
 WIN selected as a participant in the FTA’s National Workforce Grantee Summit – Implementing, Disseminating & Modeling

COMMENTS TO JUSTIFY (if NI or EE):
Effective communications and community outreach are difficult at best. The size and complexity of the District almost mandates
customization of this agency’s messaging and compounding that, the challenges of 2016 have presented an almost overwhelming task.
Additionally, an increasingly active Board has necessitated more frequent requests for delivery of information.
The Board recognizes these challenges and notes the efforts by you to provide timely, relevant information.
The weekly Monday Morning Q’s, (MMQ’s) give a good general overview of what is happening within the agency, and the weekly
General Manager’s Report contains a lot of information. The 16th Street Mall discussions have been contentious, but your efforts to
manage those conversations have gone a long way in advancing RTD’s position regarding the resurfacing.
Overall, the Board would like to be more informed of issues in a timelier manner. For example, the Board had very little information
about the decision regarding the postponement of the opening of G Line. The unfortunate result is that much of the public holds the
Board responsible and is of the opinion that FasTracks and P3 do not seem to be successful.
The Board comments that the General Manager should work with the Board, either one on one, or in small groups to reiterate the
importance of certain items. By way of example, a discussion similar to the one noted above, may have averted the failure of the
Mobility Choice Initiative and smoothed the passage of the 2017 APE.
Suggestions regarding a more robust curriculum of communications include video and/or audio recordings of Board and Committee
meetings. The Board agrees that this is critical for transparency and accountability.

Also, a more consistent, timely response to requests is requested. Examples of this include the delay in receiving results of the
forensic evaluation on the University of Colorado A line and delay in receiving results of the Legal Department’s investigation of the
complaints of “Rio Remington”. With respect to community outreach, while you have done a good job in the Denver/Boulder/Longmont
area, more outreach is requested to the other, outlying areas of the District.
The Board recognizes the challenges and would encourage more discussion on specific matters. We understand that not all requests
can be processed immediately, however, updated status reports on a more frequent basis are welcomed.

COMMENTS TO JUSTIFY (if NI or EE):
As mentioned previously, many of the roads to fiscal sustainability of this Agency have been started by previous administrations.
Certainly, the University of Colorado naming rights contract and receipt of $92 million grant funding for the Southeast Extension were
both in play well before you assumed the General Manager position.
Surely, in this economy this is one of the most challenging areas RTD faces. With insufficient funds to complete all of the corridors,
new and innovative revenue generating ideas are paramount to the continued success of RTD. Part of this responsibility lies with the
Board via setting priorities, policies and goals and a critical assessment will be appreciated by you and the Senior Leadership Team at
the Annual Retreat in 2017.
The Board is appreciative of the increased participation in the reduced fare program. RTD’s efforts to streamline non-profit distribution
channels have provided assistance to those that provide assistance and made transportation available to more people.

COMMENTS TO JUSTIFY (if NI or EE):
The Board feels some responsibility in the failure to open all 5 corridors in 2016. When the Core Goals and Tasks were drafted,
perhaps a more detailed discussion should have been initiated to probe whether this most ambitious task was realistic and attainable.
However, this Task was reviewed and approved, by you so we’ve set high expectations on that promise.
Great efforts were made to complete this task and the Board acknowledges significant progress in the completion of the North Metro
Line and the Southeast extension.
Again, challenges with the opening of the A & W lines causing the delay of the G line and the decision to delay the opening of the R
Light rail lines are factors in the achieved evaluation.
Proactive communication with the Board, the general public and stakeholders would have gone a long way in providing affirmation of
RTD’s commitment to completion. Further assurances regarding the University of Colorado A Line’s operation are in order, as well as
signage and wayfinding issues.

best to move forward. There is growing concern that the SmartCard will not be completed and the Board is concerned about the
amount of money that has and is being spent without any visible progress.
