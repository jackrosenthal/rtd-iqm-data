Discussion:

Vote on
Motion:

General Counsel Marla Lien explained this
was the action that had been previously
approved by the Board on June 15, 2010.
However, due to some missing language
that gave the General Manager blanket
authority including supplemental contracts,
this revision was needed to the resolution
for approval.
The Motion passed 12 in favor and 0
against. Directors Christopher, Martinez
and O’Boyle were absent.
