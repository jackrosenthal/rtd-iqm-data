Screening Process and Criteria cont.
• Need:
“The Mall has failing and outdated infrastructure and limited
space for safe and engaging public gathering activities. The
deteriorating infrastructure causes safety hazards for both
pedestrians and vehicles, and requires frequent and costly
maintenance. The Mall attracts large numbers of people, but a
low percentage of people stop to spend time on the Mall. The
current configuration of the Mall creates a situation in which
pedestrian corridors are constrained, creating frequent
pedestrian and shuttle conflicts”

Recommendations

March

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service.
2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.
BACKGROUND
1. RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and
RockiesRide service began that same year. The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides
and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games. Over the years, the service has been reviewed
and reduced to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two (2) routes
serving four (4) Park-n-Rides. Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games,
and for fireworks games; most games operated with six (6) buses. In 2017, there were an average
of 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD passengers).
Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the
parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board
passengers. In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer
be available. Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another
location to the Rockies-Lot. RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for
the past 24 years.
It is recommended that RockiesRide service be discontinued due to low ridership and parking issues.
2. RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure
event on October 3, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3)
Park-n-Rides. Race for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006. Peak boardings
for RACE Service occurred in 2005 (12,671 boardings) and has generally ranged between
8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011. In 2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped
to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an all-time low of 786 (approximately
393 RTD passengers). As Race for the Cure participation has declined, RTD boardings
have followed suit.
It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be
discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation that do not meet RTD
service standards.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 19

1.C.2

1. RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in utilizing 21st St. between Blake and
Market to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After looking at this location, bus
operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of buses that can be used.
Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain clear. This location will not
work for RTD.
Total boardings average 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD
passengers).
Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.
No alternative service is available on Sundays.
2. RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place
at one time. The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD
service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.
Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and
US-36 & McCaslin. No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and
US-85 & Bridge.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized.
2. RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

PUBLIC HEARINGS
There are two public hearings proposed on February 5th, 2018, at the RTD Blake street office at 12:00
noon and 6:00 PM.

May 2018 Service Changes

Information

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Included herein
is a restructure of service to the US36 & Broomfield Station (Routes 112, 120 and 128). A number of
bus stop consolidations are also proposed affecting Routes 6, 10,11, 12, 15, 16, 38 and 83, in effort to
improve on-time performance and the overall attractiveness of our service. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

1.C.3

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited: add earlier trips in each direction
Route 46 – South Dahlia: extend the route from its southern most terminal at Colorado Center Station to
the University Hills on weekends.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
Route 12 – Downing St./North Washington: reduce peak frequency south of Colfax Avenue to a

Hospital loop.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.: discontinue select (4) trips
Route 62 – Commerce City/ Dick’s Sporting Good Park: reduce mid-day frequency to hourly, due to low
ridership.
Route 65 – Monaco Parkway: discontinue select (3) weekday trips due to low ridership.
Route 105 – Havana Street: reduce peak frequency south of Southmoor Station to DTC and limited stop
consolidation.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: discontinue 3:24am northbound trip.

our service. The aim of bus stop consolidation is to provide the appropriate spacing between bus stops,
thereby reducing travel time and increasing on-time performance.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: bus stop consolidation.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: afternoon peak trips to operate to/from Elitch’s only, not Colfax/Federal
and bus stop consolidation.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: bus stop consolidation.
Route 14 – West Florida Avenue: minor schedule adjustments.
Route 15 – East Colfax: run time analysis focused on late night service and bus stop consolidation.
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited: revise stops near the Anschutz Medical Campus for closer proximity to
the major facilities.
Route 16 – West Colfax Avenue/Route 16L – West Colfax Limited: bus stop consolidation.
Route 21 – Evans: bus stop consolidation.

related interline changes as result of a change to summer service levels: (204, 225,206/206F, 208/208F
and Y.
C, D, and L Lines: minor running time adjustments are proposed for the C, D, and L Lines on all service
days as a result of the changes from January that will require some refinement of timing. This will not
alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Due to ongoing labor negotiations there may be a need to make schedule adjustments not currently
listed in this proposal. Any subsequent changes necessary will be listed in the Final Service Change
Brochure prior to the implementation to be consistent with Board policy on public notification.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $659,000. Other anticipated impacts include a reduction in the number of operators
required to provide resulting levels of service (-3.5 FTE) and a reduction of 3 AM peak , 1 base and 2 PM
peak vehicles.
PUBLIC HEARINGS

This service has been provided by RTD to CU home football games since approximately
1975. BuffRide service is currently offered from 11 Park-n-Ride locations. In 2017 Folsom
Field attendance averaged 43,320 per game. Recommend discontinuing low productivity
routes and eliminating routes where duplicate service exists.
Low productivity routes are: Route CB44 - Nine Mile (alternative H-Line transfer MALL or
C/E-Lines transfer to Flat Iron Flyer), Route CB52 - Southmoor/Broadway (alternative HLine transfer MALL to C/E-Lines transfer to Flat Iron Flyer), Route CB6 - Federal Center

from Wadsworth & Hampden (14 passengers per trip). And eliminating routes where
duplicate service exists, Route CB12 - US36 & Sheridan / US36 & Broomfield / US36 &
McCaslin (alternative Flat Iron Flyer). Cost savings estimated to be $30,830.
C, D, and L Lines
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for the C, D, and L Lines on all service days
as a result of the major change from January that will require some refinement of timing.
This will not alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No cost impacts are

Board Meeting Date: January 23, 2018

Subject:

2017 Securement Area Issues Data Analysis

As you are aware, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Association (CCDC) entered into a joint
Settlement Agreement in March of 2014 in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the
securement area on board RTD buses for passengers who use mobility aids. One of the requirements of
the Settlement Agreement was for RTD to adopt a policy to ensure individuals who use mobility aids,
including wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the securement area. The key components
of this policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and non-disabled passengers must use the seats
behind the securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, non-disabled
passengers will not be allowed to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding at bus stops

Starting with the effective date of the policy (March 22, 2014), RTD has been tracking 1) each incident
in which a bus operator reported passing up a passenger using a mobility aid and 2) each incident in
which a passenger complained that an operator had violated the policy. In accordance with one of the
reporting requirements of the Settlement Agreement, RTD is to present a report summarizing the data
noted above on an annual basis to the Board of Directors and to the CCDC. The report is also shared
with the Denver Regional Mobility Access Council (DRMAC) for posting on the DRMAC website and it is
also posted on the RTD website. This report provides a summary of the securement area issues data for
the period of January through December of 2017.
The data collected for this report is generated in three ways
1)
the operator presses a pre-programmed message button (“ADA PAX PASS-UP”) on the CAD/AVL
radio system
2)
the operator makes radio contact with RTD Dispatch using another button on the CAD/AVL radio
system
3)
a customer files a report with the RTD Customer Care Division.
Each incident generated by the above means is investigated and tracked. The investigation includes a
review of video from the bus (if available), a review of the audio file documenting the conversation
between the operator and the dispatcher, and a report from the operator which includes a copy of the
“ADA PAX PASS-UP” form given to the passenger. Based on the results of the investigation, each
securement area incident is assigned a code as follows:
DUP

Duplicate – this indicates that the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button more
than once for the same incident

Packet Pg. 44

1.C.4

NPI

Not a Pass Up Incident – this indicates that one of the following occurred
 The passenger was accommodated on this bus
 The passenger boarded the following bus which was right behind this bus (no wait
time)
 The passenger left the area
 The operator pressed the button in error
 The operator was asking a question about the policy or procedure

LIFT

Lift Inoperable – this indicates that the lift or ramp on the bus was not functioning as
required

2 W/C

2 Wheelchairs – this indicates that 2 passengers in wheelchairs were already occupying
the securement area

W/C+OMA

Wheelchair and Other Mobility Aid – this indicates that one passenger in a wheelchair and
a passenger using another mobility aid are already occupying the securement area

2 OMA

2 Other Mobility Aids – this indicates that 2 passengers using other mobility aids are
already occupying the securement area

PXO

Passenger Overload – this indicates the bus was standing room only and no one was
willing or able to move to make room

OTHER

These incidents include things like two passengers in wheelchairs want to travel together
but there is already one passenger in a wheelchair in the securement area or the flip seat
will not flip up

CSR

Customer Service Report – this indicates a report of a violation of the Policy was reported
to Customer Care

PENDING

This indicates the investigation into the incident is still in process

NO DATA

This indicates there was insufficient data available to verify that a passenger in a
wheelchair or other mobility aid was passed up

For the period of January through December of 2017, the breakdown of incidents is as follows:
1068 Total incidents recorded
-22
Duplicate entries
-320 Not a “pass up” incident
69 passenger was accommodated after button had been pressed
6

Lift inoperable
Other – several of these incidents indicate 2 passengers in wheelchairs wanted to ride
together and there was already one passenger in a wheelchair or with a mobility aid on the
bus
Investigation pending
No data available

One additional statistic that was tracked was the number of times an operator pressed the lower priority
“Request To Talk” (RTT) button in order to contact Dispatch regarding a passenger pass up instead of
the high priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button. During the reporting period of 1/1/17 through 12/31/17,
operators used the RTT button 133 times. For all of these incidents the operators were contacted and
reminded to use the higher priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button when reporting pass-up incidents.
The 2017 data also showed a high number of operators pressing the ADA PAX PASS-UP button in error.
The investigation into these incidents many times showed confusion on the part of the operator. The
ADA PAX PASS-UP button is #12 on the CAD/AVL radio system. A fare dispute is button #14. A
securement area conflict (individual refusing to move from the securement area) is button #23.
Operators often pushed button #12 when needing to report some issue other than a pass up. In each
case, operators were instructed on the proper use of button #12.
All reports of inoperable lifts were forwarded to the maintenance departments at the respective divisions
for follow up. Documentation indicates that in most cases the passenger was either accommodated by
the follower or a trade bus.
The routes generating 20 or more pass-up incidents for the period of January through December, 2017,
were as follows:
Route 0 – 84 incidents (11.7% of total)
Route 10 – 31 incidents (4.3% of total)
Route 12 – 20 incidents (2.8% of total)
Route 15 – 97 incidents (13.5% of total)
Route 15L – 59 incidents (8.2% of total)
Route 16 – 62 incidents (8.6% of total)
Route 31 – 24 incidents (3.3% of total)
Route 48 – 41incidents (5.7% of total)
Route 52 – 40 incidents (5.6% of total)
Route 76 – 25 incidents (3.5% of total)
Route JUMP – 20 incidents (2.8% of total)
RTD carries over 4.6 million passengers per month. The average number of operator-related complaints
received per month for both RTD and the private contractors through the 3rd quarter of 2017 was 1,572.

The total number of complaints received regarding a violation of the Settlement Agreement for the
period of January through December 2016 was 39.
The total number of complaints received regarding a violation of the Settlement Agreement Policy for the
period of January through December 2015 was 26.
For the period of March through December 2014 the number of complaints was 38.
The primary concerns raised in the complaints received regarding the Policy in 2017 were as follows:
 The securement area was already occupied by individuals with mobility devices.
 The bus passed the customer without providing the ADA PAX PASS-UP form.
 The operator failed to pull into the correct location to accommodate the passenger.
 The operator failed to take adequate steps to clear the securement area.

For the period of January through December 2017, RTD operators reported 720 pass-up incidents, an
average of 60 per month. Of the 720 pass-up incidents, 620 (86%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of January through December 2016, RTD operators reported 652 pass-up incidents, an
average of 54 per month. Of the 652 pass-up incidents, 496 (76%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of January through December 2015, RTD operators reported 858 pass-up incidents, an
average of 71.5 per month. Of the 858 pass-up incidents, 708 (83%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of March through December 2014, RTD operators reported 605 pass-up incidents, an
average of 60.5 per month. Of the 605 pass-up incidents, 474 (78%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
RTD and the private contractors provide ADA refresher training for all operators each year. This training
continues to reinforce RTD policies and procedures regarding accommodating passengers with
disabilities on RTD buses. It also attempts to raise operators’ awareness of the needs of passengers
with a variety of disabilities and mobility challenges.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2017

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2017 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize bus
operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. The
contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through
periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. All of the passenger accidents that occurred through the 3rd
quarter were classified non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness
of passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service with 88.4%
and 88.3% on-time performance in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (87.7%) and First
Transit Commerce City (83.5%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high number of new
operators, unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to
campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on first time
point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators
of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time
performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for
review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

1.C.5



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to address this area
by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
3rd quarter 2017 ridership was not available at the time this report was prepared and as a result
Complaints per Boarding have not been calculated. The contractors did receive 880 less
complaints year to date through the 3rd quarter 2017 when compared to the same time period in
2016. The contractors continue to utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist
operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding ontime performance have helped address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue
to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 2017 3rd Quarter Report

Information

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 1.5% through the 3rd quarter of 2017 compared to the same period
of 2016. Productivity slightly decreased from 1.25 to 1.23 passengers per hour. During the same
period, Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 14%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
decreased by 1.6% compared to 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 3.4% during the 3rd quarter of 2017
as compared to the same period of 2016. Access-a-Ride is approximately 6% under budgeted revenue
hours through the third quarter of 2017.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2017 was 96.37%; an increase when compared

Passenger on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2017 was 86.22%; an increase when
compared to the same period in 2016 (84.31).
On-time performance continues to improve resulting from an increase to operator wages which went into
effect, April 2017. The change to operator wages has contributed to improvements in our carrier’s
abilities to hire qualified staff.

Call-n-Ride technology changes: continued improvement with a new manifest being deployed within
the Call-n-Ride services. Deployed an ETA system for Call-n-Ride customers. Reduced reservation
time from 2 hours advanced notice to 1 hour.

Call-n-Rides.
In August, the City of Golden began paying for an additional 9 hours of service in the Golden Call-nRide. The Thornton Call-n-Ride began serving the new Adams County Human Services center that
opened in September 2017.

2017 3rd
Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2017. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2016.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2015 and 2016 remained at
.0004 complaints per passenger boarding. The 2017 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
Ridership data for the 3rd Quarter of 2017 was only available as a total for RTD and the private
contractors combined. Consequently, the Complaints per Passenger Boarding per operating division
could not be calculated. The Complaints per Passenger Boarding for the District as a whole (local bus
operations) for the 3rd Quarter of 2017 was .0004. The Complaints per Passenger Boarding for the
same period in 2016 was also .0004.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 69

1.C.9

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station (and the alternate
boarding/deboarding locations during CCS construction) and Denver Union Station the first week
of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some refreshers on station
procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback
on ways to improve RTD service for passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2017, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2017: the complaints in this category increased 9.7% compared to the
same period in 2016. The primary factor driving this increase is the current operator shortage. RTD and
the private contractors continue to focus on trying to reduce operator vacancies. RTD and the private
contractors continue to focus on timely pull-outs and providing service per published schedules. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.40 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 6.74 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 11.1% compared to the same
period in 2016. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 70

1.C.9

YTD average in this category for 2017 is 4.59 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 5.16 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 25.3% compared to the same
period in 2016. This category has been impacted by the operator shortages. However, occasional
improvements to staffing have resulted in periodic improvements in this category. Improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2017 is 8.05 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 10.78
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 10.1% compared
to the same period in 2016. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is
3.78 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 4.21 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 27.6% compared to
the same period in 2016. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.74 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2016 was 10.69 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category increased 12.1% compared to the same
period in 2016. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 0.27 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2016 was 0.24 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 11.8% compared to the same
period in 2016. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 1.15 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 1.31 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 25.4%
compared to the same period in 2016. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 71

1.C.9

following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2017 is 6.49 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 8.71 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 35.1% compared to
the same period in 2016. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with upto-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in
the category for 2017 is 0.35 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 0.54
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 13.4%
compared to the same period in 2016. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (137 of the total 2,885 = 4.75%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded
to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 10.57 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2016 was 12.20 complaints per day.
Although the total number of complaints is lower than the previous year, it is important to note that
ridership is also lower (3rd Quarter 2017 = 38,541,545; 3rd Quarter 2016 = 43,945,183). Complaints
may be lower because fewer passengers are riding.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:
Courtesy of bus driver (4.4)
Driving skills (4.4)
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route (4.4)
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service (4.3)
Feeling of safety on bus (4.2)
Clarity of onboard stop announcements (4.2)

Fare Enforcement Statistics

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare. There is also a designated transit security officer fare task force, whose
duties are to only ride light rail vehicles and concentrate on fare related issues throughout the service area.

Commander RTD Transit Police

Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors, dispatch
logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an
additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the authority to
check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected
include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.
