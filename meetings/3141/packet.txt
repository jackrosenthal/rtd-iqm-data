Ad Hoc Committee on Safety and Security – Final Report
December XX, 2020
Executive Summary
[To be completed.]
Background
RTD employs a security model that includes RTD Transit Police Officers, contracted
security, and contracted secondary employment off-duty law enforcement officers who are
collectively responsible for physical security across the District and who regularly enforce
compliance with the Board-approved Code of Conduct to establish, convey, and regulate
appropriate behavior on RTD vehicles, facilities, and property.
A board resolution proposing a change to RTD’s security model was brought forward earlier
this year, which prompted interest in undertaking a closer evaluation of RTD’s current
security model. As a result, Chair Rivera-Malpiede created an ad hoc committee at the
October 20, 2020 Board Meeting through which RTD Directors and staff could work
together closely to conduct an in-depth review of the security model to ensure it was the
continuing to serve the needs of the District.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede created a charter for the Committee, which is attached to this report.
In that Charter, Chair Rivera-Malpiede directed the Committee to present this formal report
incorporating its findings and recommendations to the Board of Directors no later than
December 2020, and this final report was formally published in the agenda packet for the
Board Meeting held on December 15, 2020. [A copy of this final report was also provided
to . . . .]
Purpose
The Committee was created for the purpose of reviewing the impact of the current RTD
Security Model to ensure that the agency:





continued to work toward preserving the safety, security, and accessibility of RTD’s
transit system for all patrons;
addresses the needs of RTD and all of its customers;
minimizes agency exposure/liability; and
continues to maintain statutory and regulatory compliance and to incorporate
industry best practices with respect to its security operations.

The Committee also evaluated the effectiveness of uniformed sworn law enforcement, in comparison to
contracted armed security officers, and the incorporation of mental health services.

Committee Members
The Committee was comprised of Directors representing the interests of their constituents as well as several
subject matter experts from within RTD whose role was to provide critical analysis of the impact of the
revisions to the agency’s security model and to advise in the creation of the final report to the Board. A
complete list of Committee members is provided below.

Meetings
The Committee met every week beginning October 28, 2020 through December 2, 2020. The Committee
convened a total of 6 times. Meetings were conducted via Microsoft Teams Zoom due to the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. All meetings were public and agendas and recordings of the meetings can be found on RTD’s
website: http://rtd.iqm2.com/Citizens/Calendar.aspx.
Scope and Process
The Committee began with an examination of the history of RTD’s Transit Police Division and formation of the
“Transit Police Authority.” The Transit Police Authority was created by state legislation adopted in 2004. This
authority enabled RTD to create a law enforcement division and to hire POST Certified Peace Officers to serve
as the agency’s police bureau.
The Committee also evaluated the current security model, which is comprised of Transit Police, a mental
health clinician, armed and unarmed contracted security officers, and contracted secondary employment offduty law enforcement officers from jurisdictions within the District. The Committee reviewed this model from
inception through its evolution to its current state. This review included thorough discussion of current
resource allocation and opportunities for enhancement and improvement of that allocation of resources. The
Committee also considered RTD’s homeless outreach initiative, and its efforts to coordinate with external
partners to provide for RTD’s customers who are experiencing homelessness.
RTD staff then presented a recommended new security model which will reallocate existing funding to expand
the number of sworn peace officers within RTD’s Transit Police Division. In turn, under the proposed model,
RTD will subsequently reduce the number of unsworn, contracted security officers and contracted secondary
employment off-duty law enforcement officers.
This recommendation is based on reconsideration of the size of the current contracted security staffing model
and desire for security officers to serve more of a safety function rather than an enforcement function. RTD

1.E.1.a

staff believes the proposed model can better enable RTD to provide for the safety, security, and accessibility of
its transit system.

Attachment: Final Report White Paper MM edits 11-28 (4415 : Final Draft White Paper)

The recommended security model will permit the Transit Police Division to systematically increase internal staff
and resources through five phases of deployment over five consecutive years beginning in 2021. During each
phase, RTD will reduce the number of security officers contracted to perform enforcement services. A primary
goal of the new, proposed security model is to use contracted security officers in a public safety and
observation capacity to protect critical infrastructure and ridership rather than an enforcement capacity.
The Committee also discussed the need for ongoing community outreach and engagement as the Committee
found it critical to receive input and feedback from RTD customers. This feedback will help guide the
recommended five-year reorganization plan throughout the life of the reorganization and beyond.
The Committee further discussed and encouraged ideas for additional community engagement, such as a
police cadet program which would consist of young men and women from around the District. The Committee
also discussed the possibility of seeking scholarship funding from organizations, such as the Conference of
Minority Transportation Officials (COMPTO), to assist with the costs associated with sponsoring a law
enforcement academy for selected police cadets. The program will act as a pipeline into full-time career
opportunities in transit and to create a diverse Transit Police team.
Proposed Plan
The Five-Year Phased Reorganization Recommendation

2021 Phase One Reorg
Begin the phased process of a complete security model change, which would eliminate the use of Armed
Security Officers as “First Responders” in mobile patrol Cars and as “Fare Enforcement throughout the
Commuter Rail System.
Armed Transit Security Officers would still be present at “pre-determined” platforms and facilities for rapid
response to security incidents and will be supported by RTD Transit Police Officers.
✓ Complete existing 2020 vacancy recruitments of four (4) additional Transit Police officers and three (3)
new Sergeant positions.
✓ Recruit, hire, and train six (6) additional Transit Police officers and one (1) grant-funded K-9 officer.
✓ Recruit and hire one (1) Crime Analyst to provide better data, statistics, and resource allocation.
✓ Recruit one (1) 911 Supervisor Training & Quality Assurance and one (1) 911 Programs Administrator.
✓ Begin “Phase-out” of Transit Security Officer (TSO) fare inspectors on Commuter Rail and
“Reallocating” existing funding to Commuter Rail Operations to finance “conductors.”
2022 Phase Two Reorg
In 2022, the Transit Police Division will continue to build upon the operational foundation to provide
security response capabilities, supervision, security contractor auditing and oversight, and records
management. Auditing and oversight would include RTD staff that would make daily observations of
Page 3 of 8
rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 6

1.E.1.a

contracted security for compliance. This phase will also include more patrol and response abilities, with the
eventual goal to eliminate TSOs acting in an armed response mobile capacity.

Attachment: Final Report White Paper MM edits 11-28 (4415 : Final Draft White Paper)

✓ Recruit and hire one (1) additional Operations Lieutenant, one (1) Audit & Internal Affairs Sergeant,
one (1) Training Sergeant and one (1) Patrol Sergeant & Four (4) Corporals.
✓ Recruit and hire eight (8) additional Transit Police officers.
✓ Recruit and hire (1) full-time agency Emergency Manager.
✓ Recruit and hire one (1) Security Audit “Field Inspector.”
✓ Recruit and hire one (1) Records Custodian.
2023 Phase Three Reorg
In 2023 the Transit Police Division will continue to transition to a smaller, easier to manage footprint of
contracted TSO armed security officers. In this phase the goal is to focus on line-level Transit Police
Officers and to complete the process of “foundation building.”
✓ Recruit and hire two (2) Corporals to finish supervisory capabilities.
✓ Recruit and hire Fourteen (14) entry-level Transit Police officers.
✓ Recruit and hire two (2) additional 911 Public Safety dispatchers.
2024 Phase Four Reorg
In 2024, the Transit Police Division will focus on building additional Transit Police officers that will be
strategically deployed in field operations with bus and train operators. In this phase, TSOs will be primarily
used solely for facility and platform security assignments.
✓ Recruit and hire sixteen (16) entry-level Transit Police officers.
✓ Recruit and two (2) additional 911 Public Safety dispatchers.
2025 Phase (5) Five Final Reorg Phase
In 2025, the Transit Police Division will complete the multi-year process of recruiting and training Transit
Police officers that would be needed to support the mission of the RTD. At the completion of this phase,
we would expect the entire agency to be utilizing “Conductors” for all modes of train travel. TSOs will
be required to meet stringent experience requirements and will only be authorized to work at assigned
facilities. The TSOs’ primary role will be customer service, safety and security, and to observe and report
criminal activity to law enforcement. At the completion of this phase, TSOs will only physically engage
in justifiable emergent situations. RTD Transit Police officers (Internal & External) would also be assigned
to assist at key facilities to provide oversight and assistance.
✓ Recruit and hire sixteen (16) entry-level Transit Police officers.
✓ Recruit and hire two (2) additional 911 Public Safety dispatchers.
Community Outreach and Engagement
Develop a new model for Community Outreach that move us away from the “snapshot of this point in time”
input typically obtained at brief meetings to an ongoing process that provides an opportunity for continuous
input from the community as this strategic Security reorganization is implemented.

Attachment: Final Report White Paper MM edits 11-28 (4415 : Final Draft White Paper)

The Directors will schedule or attend scheduled community events along with Mike Meader (Chief Safety and
Security Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security, and Asset Management) and/or other
representatives from the RTD Transit Police division at least quarterly to have a dialogue with constituents to
better understand concerns, needs, and partnering opportunities that will allow RTD to enhance the Security
model as move through each phase of the Reorganization. I believe that face to face conversations provide
the most candid and effective exchange of information and understanding.
In addition, continued weekly interviews with operators and represented employees by Security Improvement
Team members will ensure RTD employees can provide feedback. Feedback received through these outreach
efforts can guide additional community engagement as well.
Reporting
During the scheduled Operations and Financial Audit committee meetings throughout the year, on at least a
quarterly basis, the Security team will:




report on the status of the reorganization;
present security data; and
update the Board on feedback received from community engagement efforts.

The proposed model is intended to be flexible subject to change based upon the needs of the District.

Notes:
2021 Requested Budget for Off Duty Police is ~$4.7MM
2021 Requested Budget for Security Contract is ~20.6MM
*

Additional budget allocation by the Board may be required in 2021 and 2022 to ensure security levels are maintained
during transition (Additional Information below).

To balance RTD’s overall budget, the Security budget has been reduced each year for the last three years
beginning with an operating budget of $33M in 2019 to the current projected 2021 budget of
approximately $27M. This reorganization plan was developed according to anticipated post-COVID levels of
approximately $28.5M. However, the Security budget was reduced by an additional approximately $1.5M
under the 2021 budget recently approved by the Board on November 17, 2020. Consequently, this
reorganization may require that additional funds be allocated back into the Security budget through a

Page 7 of 8
rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 10

board action pursuant to the amended budget process, CARES funding, or higher than expected tax
revenue. The additional funding may be required to maintain the desired level of security while RTD works
to hire and train new Transit Police officers (a 4-5-month process), prior to reducing the corresponding
armed security, so that those funds can be re-allocated for ongoing funding.

Approval of Ad Hoc Committee on Security
Recommendations

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the findings and recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Security.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
• Task Goal #1 Enhance Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
RTD employs a security model that includes RTD Transit Police Officers, contracted security, and
contracted secondary employment law enforcement officers who are collectively responsible for
physical security across the District and who regularly enforce compliance with the Board-approved
Code of Conduct to establish, convey, and regulate appropriate behavior on RTD vehicles, facilities, and
property.
DISCUSSION
A board resolution proposing a change to RTD’s security model was brought forward earlier this year,
which prompted interest in undertaking a closer evaluation of RTD’s current security model. As a result,
Chair Rivera-Malpiede created an ad hoc committee at the October 20, 2020 Board Meeting through
which RTD Directors and staff could work together closely to conduct an in-depth review of the security
model and make recommendations to ensure it was continuing to serve the needs of the District.
Chair Rivera-Malpiede created a charter for the Committee, which is attached to this report. In that
Charter, Chair Rivera-Malpiede directed the Committee to present this formal report incorporating its
findings and recommendations to the Board of Directors no later than December 2020. The final report
and board presentation is published in the agenda packet.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no long-term financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve the recommendations of the Safety &
Security Ad Hoc Committee to begin phased reorganization of the RTD Security Model.
2. Do not approve the recommendations of the Safety & Security Ad Hoc Committee and keep the
existing RTD Security Model in place.
