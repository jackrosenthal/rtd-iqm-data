Executive Summary
A rising tide of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is
slowly sweeping across Denver’s high plains. Along the
RTD system over 27,000 new housing units and 26
million square feet of government and commercial space
have been built or are underway since FasTracks passed
in November 2004. Denver Union Station (DUS) has
shepherded a new transit-oriented downtown
neighborhood. The opening of five new rapid transit lines
in 2016, changing real estate market preferences for
urban living, the adoption of local plans encouraging

TOD has become a prominent
fixture in Denver’s real estate
picture propelled by the reach
of FasTracks, market
preferences and local plans.
This report summarizes how
RTD can manage an inevitable

TOD
future to the next level of
TOD at virtually every RTD station and the attractiveness of the
Denver
region as a place to live, work and play all point to the inevitability of performance.

RTD TOD Assessment

Draft Executive Summary

1.C.2.b

Experience reveals guiding, shaping and developing TOD is
complicated, typically no one entity has all the tools required to enable
TOD. Over the years RTD’s role in TOD has evolved considerably. The
RTD Board has raised a number of timely questions about how RTD’s
TOD program is doing. In response, RTD hired GB Place Making, TR

TOD function and prepare recommendations to guide the continued
evolution of the program.
The scope of this assignment did not include considering the
competing priorities of RTD’s overall mission and budgetary
constraints. Instead it includes observations and recommendations
from the consultant team for creating a robust TOD program, meeting
the expectations of its partners, and maximizing RTD’s ability to benefit
from the potential opportunity. Defining a clear mission for the TOD
group, what its job will ultimately be, and how it will be funded is an
endeavor for the Board, supported by staff, to undertake.
In a nutshell, the team found RTD’s TOD program compares well to its
national peers. The TOD pilots raised the region’s TOD competency
(RTD, Developers, Cities) – learning by doing as intended. At the same
time, competing interests between groups within RTD and the lack of
necessary processes have resulted in decisions taking too long,
sending mixed signals to partners, and causing project delays.
With the right program, policies and proceedures RTD is poised to be
a proactive national TOD leader. Getting there will require RTD to
improve decision making and operate TOD as a core RTD function by

Draft Executive Summary

How is RTD Doing with TOD?
The RTD Board wanted to know how RTD has been doing in
facilitating and enabling TOD, and what RTD needs to do to be
positioned
to fully
realize the
TOD
opportunity
facing the
region. To
answer the
Board’s
questions
we divided
our
assessment into three steps.
On the whole we found RTD’s TOD program compares well with its
peers and national best practice. And, like many of its TOD peers,

2. RTD’s TOD competency has grown as the
program has evolved. The TOD pilots raised the
region’s TOD competency (RTD, Developers, Cities) –
learning by doing as intended.
3. TOD will be a growing part of RTD’s future.
Now is the time to make the transition and better

integrate TOD into RTD’s culture and the existing and growing
transit system.
4. TOD decision making has been a challenge within RTD.
Competing interests between groups and the lack of necessary
processes have resulted in decisions taking too long, sending

TOD is Destined to be a

RTD’s TOD function has been a study in evolution, and has grown
from a passive program emphasizing “the T in TOD” in the early
2000’s, to an emerging national TOD leader propelled by the reach of
FasTracks. To be equal to the coming opportunity, RTD will need to
continue the evolution by repositioning and elevating how the agency
as a whole approaches TOD.
TOD is destined to become an increasingly larger part of RTD’s future
as a myriad of intersecting factors point to this inevitability. Consider
the widely heralded success of DUS as a new downtown transitoriented neighborhood, a growing market preference for urban living,
the adoption of community driven TOD plans at virtually every RTD
station, the scale of TOD development activity across the region and
the imminent opening of 5 new lines in 2016. Along the RTD system
over 30,000 new housing units and 28 million square feet of
government and commercial space have been built or are underway
since FasTracks passed in November 2004. Collectively, it seems like a
safe bet that those drivers should serve to accelerate the inescapable –
more and more TOD in and around RTD stations.

RTD and its riders can look forward to directly benefiting from the

What is RTD Seeking
from its TOD Program?
Guiding TOD in the 21st century will require RTD to be
clear about what it is seeking from its TOD program.

effort around RTD’s encouragement and role in
creating mixed income communities around transit. For

returns will RTD seek from the next wave of TOD projects? The
national landscape for TOD has continued to evolve since the Strategic
Plan for TOD was adopted. More transit agencies are rethinking their
goals and asking for more from their TOD programs. RTD must define
the balance its program will seek among equity, community building,

Equitable TOD. To many of RTDs peers, simply achieving more TOD is
no longer enough. Displacement and gentrification need to be
considered as well. In response, TOD is being paired with strategies for
creating greater economic opportunity, such as affordable housing and
middle-skilled jobs for low-income residents. For example, Los Angeles
Metro has set a goal that 35 percent of housing on Metro land be
affordable.
Balancing the mode of access. Portland, Seattle and Atlanta are
examples of systems that are reducing their dependence on the
automobile by routinely replacing parking to build TODs at their
stations. Continued reliance on long term parking as the primary
means of access to RTD facilities is not sustainable. A long-term
strategy to transform RTDs parking into TODs, where appropriate and
supported by local jurisdictions, would incentivize TOD and represent a
fundamental shift in the way riders get to stations and how stations fit
into the surrounding community.
Recapturing Value. It has become increasingly clear transit
investments together with supportive plans and policies create a
positive impact on real property values. Most agencies lack strategies

to monetize the value of the accessibility they create. Others, like
Boston, have utilized sophisticated programs of real estate leasing and
concessions to serve riders, create TODs and help support their
general fund.

Attachment: ExecutiveSummary_9.3.15 (2546 : TOD Assessment)

Regional TOD Leadership. The Denver region will continue to focus
growth around RTD’s stations. There are many TOD players regionally,
but no group or individual playing a leadership role or articulating a
regional TOD agenda. RTD has “led by doing”, creating model TOD
projects through its partnerships. The question at hand is what other
regional TOD leadership roles RTD should play? Should RTD convene
partners to articulate and carryout a cohesive regional TOD agenda?
What role will RTD play, relative to its partners, in its TOD program?
Like its TOD peers RTD will need to make informed choices on some
of the trade-offs inherent in these policy choices. For example, putting
an emphasis on making money from land sales typically comes at the
expense of enabling affordable TOD housing.

with it, is central to a successful program. Getting to that point can
flow from the following thoughtful sequencing:
1. Immediately develop and put the new recommended processes
and systems in place to strengthen internal decision making and

2. Create a clear mission for TOD and update the Strategic Plan for
TOD
3. Once the new GM is in place conclude the evaluation of
how tostrengthen TOD leadership within the agency and
create a stronger tie to the Real Property Division which
will also be going through a transition from focusing on
FasTracks property acquisition to proactively managing
RTD’s real property assets.

Update RTD Design Criteria. Incorporating TOD decision
making into other departments and following good TOD
design criteria at all levels will require RTD departments to
view things a little differently since modifications to existing
facilities will often be required to accommodate TOD. Design,

operations, and facilities management will need to
incorporate TOD concepts at potential TOD locations,
including rail stations and key bus stops.

Single Point of Contact. Today there is a lack of consistency
on TOD responsibilities; there are instances where different
groups have taken the lead on TOD projects. The TOD group

Strengthen Partnerships. TOD is complicated; typically no one entity

partnerships. RTD will benefit from developing and fostering strong

partnerships with local governments, non-profits and your selected
development partners.
TOD Ombudsman. Inconsistent decision-making between RTD
departments has added time, increased costs and uncertainty to TOD
projects. To help remedy that, the TOD group needs to take on the

role of an advocate / ombudsman for your selected TOD project /
developer. Much like a city land use review process, the TOD group
needs to take the lead and assume the responsibility to provide
consolidated RTD comments to a development partner in a
transparent, timely, consistent and predictable manner.

Complement and Augment RTD’s TOD tool box
Due Diligence. The TOD group currently depends on other
departments’ contracts and priorities to obtain the consultant support
it needs. The TOD group should have its own resources to complete

of consultants it needs. Its budget should reflect these needs and it
should have the ability to access support from other departments in a
timely manner to support TOD goals.

Fund TOD Positions. One of the TOD group’s staff position is a part
of the FasTracks program budget. This project position should be

considered for permanent status and moved to the base budget.

Real Estate Expertise. Through staffing decisions /use of consultants,
RTD needs to become more knowledgeable about real estate
transactions and development financing in order to better understand
the perspective of a developer and better protect RTD’s interests. The

TOD group should bring its consultants into the project earlier in order
to receive the best counsel and advice. In addition, by having a
consistently assigned counsel from the Legal Department as well as
access to specialized outside counsel, RTD can develop more expertise
over time and become a more timely and competent negotiating
partner.

Real Estate Data Base. No real estate database exists that could help
with the identification of opportunities, encumbrances, and constraints

process going forward. A comprehensive checklist of all the possible

steps required for all the potential types of disposition related to TOD
should be developed.

management issues need to be addressed with the TOD department

Manage New Revenue Opportunities. With new systems and tools in
place, RTD can also investigate new revenue generating opportunities

from concessions and compatible real estate leasing. RTD should

implement industry standard real estate asset management techniques
to capture value from a variety of sources and uses. For some
of RTD’s peers, this is the greatest source of non-fare revenue
from real estate assets. With the right tools, RTD can
definitively identify its potential.

Update the TOD Strategy
and Resolve Some Key Issues
Update the TOD Strategic Plan. RTD has a strong TOD
Strategic Plan from 2010, however, with the pilots nearly
completed, and the new emphasis on Transit Oriented
Communities, the Strategic Plan needs to be updated to

clarify the mission, how the group is organized, and the
parking policy, among other things. Once updated, it is
important that the Plan be communicated with all RTD
departments and key stakeholders to ensure good
understanding of RTD’s mission for TOC.

19

Packet Pg. 73

Draft Executive Summary

1.C.2.b

Parking Replacement Policy. A clear policy for parking replacement
needs to be defined and clearly communicated to all departments.

Unsolicited Proposals. RTD should implement an updated unsolicited
proposal policy. Implementation of a new proposal policy should help

maintain control over its priorities for TOD development.
Be Proactive with TOD. At times the opportunities for TOD will
exceed RTD’s ability to keep up. The TOD program needs to shift from
being reactive to becoming proactive. In part that means going where

you have a willing partner and where the preconditions to success are
in place, both informed by a station portfolio analysis.

Prioritize TOD Opportunities. Virtually every RTD station area has
TOD plans in place. Local governments and community groups have
spoken on what they want, the new station area plans paint a picture
of TOD as the desired urban form. The TOD group should complete its

analysis of station access, market, and community development
opportunities at stations and prioritize the best TOD opportunities
based upon readiness for development.
