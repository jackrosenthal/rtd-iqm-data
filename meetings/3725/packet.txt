BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Southeast Light Rail Corridor Preventative Maintenance

June 24, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Dave Jensen, AGM Rail Operations
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
45 minutes
BACKGROUND
At RTD, the safety of customers and employees is paramount; work is constantly underway to ensure
an operationally safe transit environment. As the recipient of federal funds for transit operations, RTD is
subject to federal statutes and regulations regarding system safety and asset management. The Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) require transit agencies to
develop safety management systems describing their approach to safety and compliance with federal
safety rules and regulations. The FRA governs commuter rail and the FTA governs light rail.
While the FTA retains the regulatory authority for light rail, it has delegated its responsibilities as the
State Safety Oversight Agency to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). In that role, the
CPUC governs the agency’s compliance with the FTA-required Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP). The PTASP must include processes and procedures to implement Safety Management Systems
(SMS). SMS is a comprehensive, collaborative approach that brings together management and labor to
control risk and to detect and correct operational safety problems. Each year the PTASP must be
approved by the Joint Labor Management Safety Committee, the Board of Directors, and the CPUC.
The FTA-required Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It
includes the principles RTD uses to make asset decisions aligned to the Strategic Plan; the state of
assets for which RTD has capital responsibility; and the proposed capital investment plan. RTD submits
its TAM Plan to FTA Region 8, the metropolitan planning organization, which is Denver Regional Council
of Governments (DRCOG), and the Colorado Department of Transportation, for incorporation into the
State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).
The General Manager and CEO is the Accountable Executive for both the PTASP and TAM Plan.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the SMS and TAM Plan, RTD Maintenance of Way staff conduct quarterly preventative
maintenance inspections to identify and address areas where light rail track defects exist. By addressing

Packet Pg. 3

4.A

issues and defects through early intervention repairs and maintenance, RTD is able to ensure all rail
assets are in a state of good repair. Preventative maintenance supports RTD’s efforts to avoid service
disruptions and major infrastructure issues.
RTD adheres to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) standards for the periodic
inspection and maintenance of fixed structure rail transit tracks. APTA’s standards, which RTD adopted
and began using in May 2024, include visual, electrical, and mechanical inspections of components that
affect safe and reliable operations, as well as standards for implementing corresponding speed
restrictions. These standards also identify the necessary qualifications for rail transit system employees
or contractors who perform periodic inspections and maintenance tasks.
The APTA standards also address speed restrictions to be implemented where trains operate at slowerthan-normal speeds until maintenance and repair work is completed. Consistent with these standards, the
current speed restrictions were temporarily implemented in two zones, between Colorado and Southmoor
stations and between Belleview and County Line stations, until necessary maintenance work can be
performed. RTD adheres to the highest level of safety standards, even when it results in an impact to
scheduled services and on-time performance.
Since the Southeast Corridor’s speed restrictions were first implemented in early June, RTD has provided
regular and continual updates to its Board of Directors, disseminated Service Alerts to customers, engaged
often with the media, and shared information with agency employees.

speeds where the track can be carefully assessed

• Travel at a speed no greater than 5 MPH when inspecting at-grade

crossings and switches, and up to 15 MPH elsewhere on the system

• Staff also walk the entire 120 miles of light rail track every 90 days

§ Improved record-keeping and documentation process
• Take measurements to identify recurring issues and analyze patterns

§ Process will evolve to deliver even better results in the future

Southeast Corridor Inspections
§ In May 2024, RTD staff conducted a scheduled inspection
§ Several minor issues and cosmetic defects were discovered
• No structural defects to the rail base, web, fasteners, substructure, or bed
• By addressing issues and defects early, RTD can avoid avoid service disruptions
and major infrastructure issues

§ Prior to the inspections, RTD did not foresee a service impact

Railhead Burn
§ Instances of railhead burn (“wheel burn”) were found on the top
side of the track

• Can lead to the formation of tiny cracks and surface irregularities over
time

§ The current 10 mile-per-hour speed restrictions follow APTA’s
minimum remedial actions

• Depending on the size of the railhead burn, the minimum remedial
action required is reduced speeds until the issue is addressed

• RTD has taken depth and size measurements for each instance of
railhead burn
