Public Hearing: Feedback on Eagle P-3 Proposals
Howard Humke, Denver, spoke about a number of issues including the number of stops
along the route 15 Eastbound Colfax. He shared his medical condition with the Board
indicating that often he is not recognized as a rider with physical constraints. He is
concerned about the drug trafficking along the route and requested RTD to talk to the
DEA department about this problem. He would like to see more accuracy in the MY
Stop system.
Art Duvall, Denver, advocated on behalf of the local community to include more
apprenticeships on the Eagle P-3 program.
Art Way, representing Colorado Progressive Coalition, stated he was a civil rights
organizer who would like to see more apprenticeships and assistance with low income
people who would like the opportunity to work. As he looks at the Northwest and
Northeast neighborhoods, he would like to see more outreach to the communities on
work opportunities and suggested we could put up billboards, posters, etc. in the local
community to reach the people where they live.
Jenny Santos, 9 to 5, National Association of Working Women, made an appeal for the
Eagle P-3 to reach the working class people of color and low income who are not only
looking for jobs but looking for a career that will help the communities to grow.
Eliska Champagne-Veselka, Denver, spoke on the need to get our young people

gainfully employed in the community. She requested Eagle P-3 opportunities for low
income people in the construction field.
Chair Pro Tem Martinez thanked the participants for their comments and
considerations. He shared that RTD is committed to workforce development and is
demonstrating through various programs that we have to be inclusive for this regional
community. We have a DBE/SBE program that is a national model where we
consistently meet or exceed our goals. Our plans with the Eagle P-3 project are to
continue this track record of community involvement and growth. Our hope is not to
leave any segments of our communities out.
Director Cohen reflected on how these comments from various representatives from
the community just underscore the importance of RTD’s efforts in creating jobs and
opportunities for the community.
Director McMullen commented that the Board has indeed taken note of what has been
said and our intent is to be totally inclusive.
