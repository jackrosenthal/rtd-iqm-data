BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Board Committee Restructure

Committee Meeting Date:
September 14, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure (ad hoc committee) was formed in 2020 by Chair
Rivera-Malpiede to analyze the advisability of altering the composition of the Board’s standing
committees to optimize the number of members assigned to each committee; encourage full and fruitful
debate by decentralizing decision-making; leverage members’ relevant experience; and promote meeting
efficiencies. Directors Cook and Tisdale led the ad hoc committee’s work.
During August 2021, a working group convened by the General Manager and CEO, composed of
Directors Cook and Tisdale, General Manager and CEO, and staff, designed a process to implement the
ad hoc committee’s work into a recommendation for the Board’s consideration of a new committee
structure. The working group, based on previous feedback received from Directors, aligned on the
concept of establishing four standing committees, along with a separate Audit Committee. It is
proposed that each standing committee would be composed of between five and seven members and
that the Audit Committee composition would be prescribed by the International Professional Practices
Framework (IPPF) and confirmed by a third-party subject matter expert.
On Thursday, August 19, 2021, the Executive Committee revisited these prior discussions and directed
staff to return with a committee restructure proposal for the Board’s discussion.
DISCUSSION
Based upon the committee restructure feedback garnered from Board members by Directors Cook and
Tisdale, the key tenets are as follows:
1. Create smaller committee composition
3. Enhance committees’ effectiveness
2. Decrease the number of committees
4. Optimize committee meeting times
Prior to rendering a final recommended action for the Board’s consideration in October, the working
group will propose draft recommendations and seek further Board feedback regarding the following
items:
• The days and times the committees will meet
• The number of Directors per committee
• The number of committees
• Matters to be addressed by each committee

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

• The selection method for committee membership
• The selection method for committee chairs and vice-chairs
• Incorporation of public comment at committee meetings
The committees identified by the working group are as follows:
Executive Committee:
Responsible for governance and public affairs.
Operations and Safety Committee:
Responsible for consideration of transit service delivery, safety, and security matters.
Finance and Planning Committee:
Responsible for consideration of all long-term financial planning, budget, and planning/program
management matters.
Performance Committee:
Responsible for adherence to the agency’s strategic plan and the General Manager and CEO’s
performance.
*Audit Committee (meets quarterly or as necessary–exception to the standing committees’ meeting
schedule and structure):
Responsible for ensuring the responsibility of the internal audit function’s independence and efficacy.
*Note that the Audit Committee composition and structure must align with the International Professional
Practices Framework (IPPF).

Committee Meeting Date:

Transit Asset Management

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manger and CEO
Lou Cripps, Senior Manager, Asset Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Federal regulations 49 CFR Part 625 Transit Asset Management and 49 CFR Part 630 National Transit
Database (NTD) require all transit agencies to develop a Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP) that
includes an asset investment prioritization process that ranks projects to improve or manage the state of
good repair of capital assets. This TAMP must be shared with the agency’s planning partners, which for
the Regional Transportation District (RTD), is the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Denver
Regional Council of Governments.
49 CFR Part 625 also requires that the transit agency identify an accountable executive to ensure that
the agency’s TAMP is effectively implemented throughout the public transportation system in
compliance with federal regulations. RTD’s accountable executive is the General Manager and CEO.
The General Manager and CEO has directed the Chief Safety and Security Officer, Assistant General
Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, to provide regular TAMP status updates to the
Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
This discussion will include the following:
• TAMP Requirements
• Asset Backlog

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
January 2022 Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
September 14, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, the January 2022
Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work
assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations
plan for RTD’s transit network.
A vital part of the development of the service plan involves stakeholder and customer input processes.
The stakeholder listening phase is in addition to the public listening phase, which concluded August 30,
2021 as a part of the January 2022 service change process. Both stakeholder feedback and customer
input will help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
Service changes implemented during 2021 were in part directed toward recovery from impacts
experienced due to COVID-19. Current ridership levels have seen modest increases, with ridership
cresting 50% of pre-COVID levels. Modest increases in service levels have been implemented with each
service change, and system capacity has been increased with the lifting of capacity restrictions. It
should be noted that current levels of service offered largely exceed current ridership demand.
Additionally, RTD is challenged with attracting and retaining operators, like many major service industry
and local government employers. RTD has implemented incentives to aid recruitment and retention of
front-line employees, with the goal of increasing the agency’s capacity to increase service. At this time
operator availability will not support a substantial “return of service.”
The proposals herein contain a mix of modest service improvements and adjustments aimed at
maintaining on-time performance and contract compliance. It is intended that the proposed service
changes to the current COVID-19 service plan be adopted as further modification to the initial COVID
service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in subsequent service changes in 2021.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to encompass:

Packet Pg. 17

1.C.3

•
•
•
•
•
•

Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and those who rely on RTD’s services
The availability of alternative services to affected customers
Cost-effective distribution throughout the service area and family of services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, in that benefits and services are provided without regard to race,
color or national origin and without disparate impacts on low-income and minority populations
Responses to changes in the communities where services are provided

Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID-19-induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guidance for the proposed January 2022 service changes come from the Board-adopted
guidance for COVID-19 budget reductions, particularly the Board’s stated desire to maximize mobility
during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon RTD services to access essential jobs
and their necessities, while also keeping community activity centers appropriately connected.
