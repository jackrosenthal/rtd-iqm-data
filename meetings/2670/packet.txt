Subject:

Construction Award for IFB 37-DH 001.
Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair
Facility.

General

Board Meeting Date: July 25, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AD Miller Services in the amount
not-to-exceed of $5,627,730 for the New Customer Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility
project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Amended Budget. It is further recommended
that the General Manager or his designee be authorized to issue contract amendments in the total
amount not-to-exceed the remaining approved project budget of $845,393 as needed.
BACKGROUND
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) operating facility at 711 W. 31st Avenue in Denver was
acquired by FasTracks in 2010 for the construction of the Electrified Segment of Northwest Rail. A
section of the building was in the path of the commuter rail flyover bridge for the corridor. The building
originally had four bays and an additional office/crew rooms section. The eastern bay was removed
along with the offices/crew rooms to accommodate the flyover. The building was originally built in the
1940’s by the Rocky Mountain Motor Company which maintained and stored buses. After that, it was
acquired by the BNSF and used as an operating facility and repair shop.
With the growing demand for space across RTD’s operating facilities, a facilities space planning study
was conducted. Based on location, size, and access to the DUS Transit Hub, it was recommended to
relocated the Customer Care Call Center and the Treasury facility to this location. Both groups needed
additional space for their operations. Also, this freed up additional space for the Bus Operations Group at
District Shops.
Additional requirements/space for the Customer Care Division, Treasury Division and Bus Operations has
been a direct impact from RTD’s FasTracks expansion.
DISCUSSION
The three bays total approximately 45,000 square feet. Customer Care will take the eastern most bay.
Their space will be made up of offices and the telephone information call center. This will allow for
current space requirements and future expansion. The Treasury will be in the center bay. Their space will
include offices, equipment repair workstations, small parts inventory storage, secure revenue equipment
storage, and a truck loading area. The remaining west bay of the building will be minimally upgraded for
code compliance. This bay is currently programmed to house maintenance and storage operations.
The IFB was advertised on April 11, 2017. Bids were received and opened on June 28, 2017. Three
bidders proposed in the following manner.

SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a
contract to AD Miller Services in the amount not-to-exceed of $5,627,730 for the New Customer
Care Call Center and Treasury Repair Facility project. Funding for this contract is included in the
