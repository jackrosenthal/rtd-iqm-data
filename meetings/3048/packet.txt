This Recommended Action supports the following General Manager’s 2020 goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service.
BACKGROUND
The Platte Maintenance and Storage Facility was constructed in 1975 and opened for operations in

buses. The total area of roof to be replaced is 249,000 square feet.
DISCUSSION
The roof has exceeded its useful life in excess of 6 years beyond the 20 year warranty and needs a
complete replacement. This will be the third roof for the facility in its 45 years of operations. The project
was advertised as an IFB. The IFB was advertised on August 10, 2020. The bid letting was on
September 22, 2020. Six companies bid on the project.

Access-a-Ride Web Portal

Information

RTD Launches New Portal for Access-a-Ride Customers
Progressive web app enables trips to be booked online, shows vehicle location and estimated time of
arrival
DENVER (Oct. 26, 2020) – Starting today, Regional Transportation District (RTD) customers who rely on
the agency’s Access-a-Ride service can access a highly anticipated resource: a web-based Customer
Portal that allows them to track their ride in real time, book new trips and cancel scheduled trips, all
from a desktop or mobile device.
The Access-a-Ride Customer Portal – developed entirely in-house over the last year by RTD’s IT team –
is a progressive web app that allows for easy monitoring and management of upcoming trips for Accessa-Ride, RTD’s complementary paratransit service. It updates every 30 seconds to provide customers
with a location and an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for their vehicle. The portal, available through the
RTD website, can be bookmarked on a web browser and added to a smartphone as a new icon. To
ensure that the Customer Portal is accessible, it has been independently certified as having met or
exceeded Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
“This is definitely the type of app that, when you use it once, you will be hooked,” said Access-a-Ride
Manager Larry Buter. “It is the game-changer that our customers have been waiting for and asking about
for years.”
To this point, Access-a-Ride customers could manage trips and confirmations by contacting reservations
or dispatch, or by using RTD’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, a voice-activated phone tree.
The IVR system places calls to passengers the night before their next-day trip as a reminder, and it calls
again the day of the trip to let passengers know when their vehicle is 10 to 15 minutes away. While
helpful, such an estimate can be altered by traffic and other variables, which makes a difference to
someone waiting in inclement weather, for example. The ETA in the Customer Portal reflects data from
Mapbox, a mapping and location cloud platform that is aware of real-time traffic.
The Customer Portal was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind – providing users with the
information they want without anything extra that could prove distracting. It includes three tabs:
•

“ETA”, which provides real-time information for the next trip and updates automatically every 30
seconds with the following details:
o Estimated minutes until pickup or drop-off
o Scheduled pickup or drop-off time, if estimated time is unavailable
o Map of vehicle location, predicted vehicle route, intermediary stops and destination

Packet Pg. 5

1.D.1

•

•

“Scheduled”, which details scheduled trips that are not in progress or canceled. Through this tab,
customers can select and cancel trips that are not to occur within the next two hours. (To cancel
a trip scheduled within the next two hours, the customer will need to call Access-a-Ride.)
“Book”, which allows a customer to book a trip to or from any of their favorite locations. The
customer’s home address is included in this list by default. Trips can be booked two to five days
out.

Before release, RTD tested the Customer Portal in beta form with six members of RTD’s Access-a-Ride
Paratransit Advisory Committee to better understand how it performs, gauge experience with navigation
and determine whether there was room for improvement. Those who took part spoke highly of the
portal, rated its functionality favorably, said it is easy to navigate and expressed appreciation for the
ETA function.
Individuals qualify for travel on Access-a-Ride by being unable to access a bus stop or a lift-equipped
fixed-route bus by themselves, or by having a disability that prohibits independent travel on a fixed-route
bus, criteria set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). RTD has more than 16,000
active Access-a-Ride customers and has continued to deliver an average of 21,025 trips each month
during the pandemic. Frequent travel destinations include day programs, medical offices, dialysis centers
and workplaces. Access-a-Ride began offering grocery delivery and pickup to its customers in March.
New customers interested in using Access-a-Ride service can sign up by filling out an application on the
RTD website or by calling 303-299-2960. From there, they must provide a medical verification form and
complete an in-person interview and transportation assessment.
ABOUT RTD
The Regional Transportation District develops, operates and maintains a public transportation system
that meets the transit needs of close to 3 million people within an eight-county service area in the
Denver Metro region. RTD’s buses, rail lines, shuttles and additional services provide approximately 100
million annual passenger trips. For more information, visit rtd-denver.com, call 303-299-6000 and follow

After an email address has been provided or updated, an activation email will be sent to the customer that
allows them to set their password. Once a password has been set, the customer can login to the Customer
Portal using their email address and the newly created password. A step-by-step process for the first-time

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.84% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in October 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (October) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

October 2020 – 20.65 hours
October 2019 – 485.37 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1693.37 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 3065.26 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in October were bus bridges and the COVID19 pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.84% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6 th day”.
