BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Salaried Trustee Appointment

February 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2023, replacing Leah Riley, Chief
Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer as Trustee with a term expiring
December 31, 2023, replacing Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations with Adam Barnett, Manager,
Total Rewards as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024, extending the December 31, 2022
expired term of Bill Weidenaar, Manager, Technical Services as a Trustee through December 31, 2024,
extending the December 31, 2022 expired term of Director Bob Broom as a Trustee through December
31, 2024 and replacing Director Peggy Catlin, whose term expired December 31, 2022 with Director
Bobby Dishell as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024 for the Salaried Employee Defined
Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees

Packet Pg. 24

16.A

who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same Trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before
January 1, 2008, and a defined contribution retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each
plan is currently overseen by a Board of Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two RTD Board members
and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving as a permanent Trustee. RTD staff Trustees are
recommended to the RTD Board by the General Manager and CEO for appointment and the RTD Board
Chair, with full RTD Board approval, appoints two RTD Board members as Trustees.
This action item seeks Board approval to modify the Trustee composition of these Trusts with the
following:
• Replace Trustee Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People
Officer, as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2023
• Replace Trustee Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations, with Adam Barnett, Manager, Total
Rewards, with a term expiring December 31, 2024
• Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Trustee Bill Weidenaar, Manager,
Technical Services, that expired on December 31, 2022
• Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Board member Trustee Director Bob
Broom, whose term expired December 31, 2022
• Replace Board member Trustee Director Peggy Catlin, whose term expired December 31, 2022,
with Director Bobby Dishell to a term expiring December 31, 2024
• No change to current Trustee Bill Sirois, Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, with a term
expiring December 31, 2023
• No change to the Chief Financial Officer position as a permanent member
The above actions will result in a body of seven Trustees with two of those Trustees, Mr. Weidenaar
and Mr. Sirois, being participants in the closed defined benefit pension plan.
The appointment of these Trustees will focus Trust governance with employees who participate in and
represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise in the areas of human
resources, health and wellness benefits and finance as well as maintain Board participation in the
salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Town of Parker Anthology Annexation

February 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the annexation petition from Anthology Management for inclusion
of a 984-acre parcel into the District. Upon approval of this annexation, the area would become part of
District G, currently represented by Director Bouquet.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, Planning Department
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Section 32-9-106.7, Colorado Revised Statutes, provides a process for areas outside the RTD boundary
to petition into the District. Specifically:
32-9-106.7. Additional district area – petition or election – required filings – definitions. (1) (b) For
any area in an incorporated or unincorporated portion of any county containing multiple parcels of
land, any of which is less than 35 acres and which area is contiguous to any boundary of the district,
the area may be included in the district after one of the following conditions is met:
I.One hundred percent of the owners of the land within the specified area, including the owners of
any land constituting a planned unit development or subdivision, submit a petition to the
board seeking inclusion in the district. The petition shall contain a legal description of the land,
shall state that assent to the inclusion is given by the fee owner or owners thereof, and shall
be acknowledged by the fee owner or owners in the same manner as required for the
conveyance of land.
II.(A) A petition requesting an election for the purpose of including the specified area in the district
signed by at least eight percent of the eligible electors who reside within the geographic
boundaries of the area is submitted to the board. The petition shall contain a legal description
of the area.
Pursuant to 32-9-106.6 (1) (b), Colorado Revised Statutes, any area annexed by an in-District
municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. However, many
properties within the Town of Parker, including the property in question, were annexed to the Town of
Parker prior to 1994 and, accordingly, are not included within the District boundaries, thereby creating a
checkerboard of properties that lie within and outside the boundary.

Packet Pg. 30

16.B

The applicant, Anthology Management, owns 100 percent of the property and has submitted an
annexation petition to RTD, which includes a legal description of the property in the Town of Parker. The
petition has been reviewed by Legal Division staff for legal sufficiency; the legal description has been
further reviewed by RTD’s boundary mapping consultant.
The property is in the Town of Parker and contains approximately 984 acres west of South Parker Road
in the general vicinity of an area defined by Motsenbocker Road, Hess Road, Stroh Road and
undeveloped land to the west. The land is mostly vacant, although zoning will allow for a mix of
approximately 23 acres for commercial use with the remaining land zoned as open space and residential
uses, allowing up to 3,082 residential units in a mix of single and multifamily residences.
The land is contiguous with the current District boundary along several boundaries to the north, east and
south side of the land to be annexed. The proposed annexation is located adjacent to Director District G.
Currently, the nearest transit service to the property is provided by the P Regional route, which runs
along South Parker Road, approximately two miles east of the property. The Board-adopted System
Optimization Plan does not envision new service to this area.
DISCUSSION
Upon the Board’s approval of the Anthology Management’s petition, the area would become part of
District G, currently represented by Director Bouquet.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. Currently, much of the Town of Parker is within the RTD boundary, but substantial
pieces lie outside, thereby creating confusion among residents as to whether they are required to pay to
park at Park-n-Rides or whether they are subject to the RTD sales and use tax. Inclusion of additional
areas of the town into the District will serve to alleviate this issue to some extent.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impacts to RTD from this action include an undetermined amount of additional revenue from
sales tax and use taxes from the commercial properties and relatively small amounts from automobile
sales to residents of the area. There may also be future expenditures should RTD opt to expand transit
services to this area. The Board-adopted System Optimization Plan does not envision new service in the
immediate area; however, the Subregional Service Councils and the Call for Projects Partnership Program
provide an avenue for ongoing dialogue and potential funding for new services, if desired.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Schedule for In-person and Remote Meetings

February 23, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2023 Schedule (Schedule) for In-person and Virtual Meetings.
In adopting the Schedule, the Board anticipates holding all standing and ad hoc committee meetings
virtually and holding monthly Board Meetings, Special Board Meetings, and study sessions in-person at
the 1660 Blake Street Offices, commencing with the March 28, Board Meeting, unless otherwise
determined by the Chair in consultation with the Executive Committee. The in-person meetings will still
have a hybrid or virtual option for public participation.
REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since the Board Meeting held on Tuesday, March 24, 2020, and until February 2023, the Board of
Directors has held all its official committee and Board meetings virtually, at first due to physical
distancing practices necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and later due to the unavailability of the
Board’s primary meeting room at 1660 Blake Street while renovations to the room were taking place.
DISCUSSION
Current local, state, and federal health guidance now allows for individuals, specifically those who are
not displaying signs of illness and who follow proper precautions, to resume meeting in indoor public
places. Further, the renovation work to the Board’s primary meeting room is winding down, although
similar renovations are needed in the Board’s smaller conference room to ensure a welcoming and
accommodating environment for meeting attendees.
During the Tuesday, January 31, 2023, Board Meeting, the Directors discussed options for the
resumption of certain in-person meetings. From this discussion, the following themes emerged:
1. All meetings to be held in-person every other month
2. All meetings to be held virtually
3. All committee/ad hoc meetings to be held virtually, with Board Meetings, Special Board
Meetings, and study sessions to be held in person
4. All monthly meetings for a given month to be held in person on a quarterly basis
5. All meetings to be held in-person

Packet Pg. 44

17.C

Board Office staff later polled the Directors and asked them to rank the options by order of preference.
Of the Directors who responded anonymously to the ranked choice polling, a majority of Directors
preferred option 3. In adopting this recommended action, the Board memorializes this ranked-choice poll
to resume holding certain meetings in person, while the remainder will be held virtually, as identified in
the Schedule.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board memorializes the plurality of members’ desire to resume
holding certain meetings in person, while the remainder will be held virtually, as identified in the
Schedule.
The Chair, in consultation with the members of the Executive Committee, may determine that a change
in meeting location for a given meeting, whether virtual or in-person, is necessary or advantageous to
the Board or its committees. Sufficient public notice will be given in the event of any change of meeting
location.
Approval of this recommended action meets the agency’s Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Sufficient funding for anticipated financial impacts associated with this action item is currently allocated
in the 2023 budget.
