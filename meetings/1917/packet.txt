(RTD Board Operating Guidelines)
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District desires to operate in
a considerate, thorough and effective manner and to respect the ideas and opinions of all board members

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES
BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to transit and the goals of the Regional Transportation District. In meeting this
commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when it focuses on and helps clarify
high-level policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital and operating budgets. In
contributing to policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and mission of RTD and its
priority objectives for the coming years. The Board appreciates that this is an unusual time for RTD
because of the major capital investment in FasTracks that will change the way in which transit is supplied
in the Denver metropolitan area for decades to come. We appreciate that as elected officials we each
represent different areas with different needs and have a responsibility to our constituents. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy and executive functions it must perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through our deliberations. Thus we value openness
in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We also place a premium
on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that issues will vary in their
complexity, we value timely decision-making.
STEPS TO ENHANCE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The Board supports the following steps to enhance our effectiveness:
1. Recognizing there is not a clean line between policy and management, the Board will place a
premium on conducting policy level discussions at Board meetings and retreats.
2. The Board believes occasional retreats to focus on specific policies, or policies that help guide budget
formulation, will help produce more efficient and effective Board meetings.
3. The Board believes the staff can help it be effective by focused preparation of background material
and packets, concise framing of policy issues, and being available to brief and answer questions from
Board members ahead of meetings.
4. In the interest of focused and efficient discussions, Board members commit to reading appropriate
material ahead of time and staying focused on the topic at hand.
5. Board members are encouraged to address issues for which they have a particular interest, but which
might not be broad policy concerns of the full Board, with staff or at committee meetings rather than
at full Board meetings.
6. The Board recognizes that our members come to RTD with different perspectives and styles. We
value tolerance and appreciation of the Board’s diversity.
7. The Board recognizes that technology and technological tools can enhance the Board meeting
experience by providing timely access to information and research relevant to the topics at hand. The
Board supports the use of electronic devices (i.e. iPhones, Smart Phones, iPads and similar devices)
during committee and Board meetings as long as the use of these devices is not disruptive to the

Packet Pg. 7

1.2.1

meeting and that Board members provide the proper attention and courtesy to the people in
attendance at the meeting. Cellphones or devices with sound should be silenced with no vibrations.
Voice calls during the meetings are discouraged. Board members are reminded not to communicate
with one another via electronic devices at Board meetings, as all debate should take place in public
forum.
8. We empower the Board Chair and the chairs of our committees to seek the appropriate balance
between open and thorough discussions and timely decisions to bring discussions to closure and to
remind Board members of our commitment to these guidelines.
SPECIFIC NEXT STEPS
▪

Devote time for a Board discussion of criteria to be used in RTD RFPs, which should include the
appropriate level of due diligence the Board should perform on contracts.

▪

Define a date for a Board retreat designed to elicit and discuss some of the most important policy
concerns of Board members.

▪

Establish an annual Joint Board/Staff meeting or retreat that will focus exclusively on policy guidance
for the formulation of the operating and capital budget and the General Manager’s Tactical Goals (i.e.
strategic planning advance).

▪

Identify the types of issues that do not need to come before the Board (e.g., items previously
approved in the budget process or items that could be addressed solely by staff).

▪

Have staff support the Board through its packet preparation with specific actions such as:
▪ highlighting both the guiding policy issue and the decision being sought, and the strategic
goal that the action supports.
▪ limiting the volume of material (augmented by appended material if needed),
▪ bringing more complex items to the Board initially as discussion items and later as decision
items,
▪ providing packets sufficiently ahead of time so that when necessary Board members can be in
contact with either staff or constituents, and,
▪ when appropriate, setting forth options for Board consideration.

▪

Adopt flexible ground rules to guide Board discussions such as:
▪ avoid repeating arguments,
▪ focus on new points,
▪ avoid distracting non-verbal communications, and,
▪ limit comments when a decision of the Board is overwhelmingly clear.



Re-commit to these modified guidelines in 2014 and to ensure we are holding ourselves accountable
to the intent of these guidelines. Also make an accompanying commitment to review their application
on an as-needed basis from the date of this adoption.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 8, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 7, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2014

Subject:

Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2014

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the Board of Directors approve the 2014
Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenses to date and all planned expenses through the year
2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for board-approved
projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On April 1, staff provided an update on the 2014 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. That presentation is attached. There
have been no changes to the project information since that presentation.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2013 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.3 billion, and approximately
$3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2013.
Since most of our projects are complete or under construction and are being managed within the Boardapproved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily reflect updates to
the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation. A summary of these changes
for the 2014 APE capital budget is:


Incorporation of the US36 BRT scope as approved by the Board in September 2013; with the
exception of the Broomfield parking structure and the north/west-bound Church Ranch platform
which will be completed after 2019;



I-225 storage tracks approved by the Board in April 2014;



Incorporation into the capital budget of the additional (4) Eagle vehicles approved by the Board in
December 2013;

Packet Pg. 13

2.11.A



Purchase of BNSF right-of-way, west of Ward Road on the Gold Line approved by the Board in
2010.

This APE is a key input to the overall, long-term financial plan that is part of the Senate Bill (SB) 208
Baseline Report that is scheduled to be reviewed by the RTD Board and submitted to DRCOG in the
summer of 2014. The SB 208 and related Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendment will include a
comprehensive financial plan that includes all costs and revenues for both base system and FasTracks
through the year 2040.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE, must identify the necessary changes
to the financial plan and be submitted to the Board for approval before they could proceed. Therefore,
the APE is a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes
approved by the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The acceleration of the US 36 BRT project scope through 2018 totals $17.45 million. Of this total,
$1.25 million would be funded through a FASTER grant received in 2014, and the balance of $16.2
million would be funded through the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
The remaining
changes would be funded within the cash flow of the financial plan adopted by the Board of Directors in
November 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the
Board of Directors approve the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.
2. Do not approve the 2014 APE. This is not recommended as FasTracks would not have an updated,
capital budget to manage the program through the year 2019.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 15, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 14, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2014

Subject:

Board Report August 2014 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and,
further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary
for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will adjust services in response to
changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. As part of an overall
effort to maintain our light rail system in a state of good repair, we are proposing changes to the late
night service on light rail, which will create a wider maintenance window for repairs to infrastructure.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Six public hearings were held between May 7th and May 14th in Evergreen, Aurora, Commerce City
Denver and Boulder. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2014 service change. Also included in these changes are items changed by amendment of the
initial proposal, through actions of the Board of Directors:

School service resumed. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/North Pecos
This proposal adds a 5:19am eastbound trip from Wewatta/16th to Centrepoint & Sable,
which will provide earlier reverse peak service into the city of Aurora. A running time
analysis will also be conducted to improve on-time performance. Cost estimated to be
approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to realign trips after 6:30 p.m. and all day weekends and holiday service to
operate into Civic Center Station. Southbound buses would enter from Broadway,
northbound buses would travel via West Colfax and 15th Street. An additional trip in the
PM peak, leaving southbound at around 5:26pm, from Wagon Road Park-n-Ride is also
proposed to cover a current service gap in the schedule. Saturday running time
adjustments are also needed. Cost estimated to be approximately $10,300 annualized.

reliability. Cost is estimated to be $103,300 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/ Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow us to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to
this location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips. It is also proposed to separate
interlines on Sundays, which will require an additional bus to improve recovery time on the
service. Weekday peak running time adjustments are also proposed. Cost is estimated to
be $65,800 annualized.

side of Colorado Center Drive. No cost impact is anticipated.
Routes EV/ES/EX –Evergreen/Aspen Park/Denver
It is proposed to discontinue (one) highway stop along Colorado 74 for safety reasons.
Route ES would serve the Frontage Road at Lewis Ridge Road in order to maintain walk-in
stops where practical. A running time review also would be conducted. No cost impact is
anticipated.
Route HX- 28th Street-Civic Center

Nine Mile at 7:13 and terminating at I-25 & Broadway at 7:35 with connections to the
7:38 0Ltd and other routes. This will help relieve overcrowding on the 7:04 and 7:19
northbound trips, which are each experiencing Weekday average passenger loads of over
420 and thus nearing Service Standards. This trip would run Mondays-Thursdays, in
conjunction with the new fourth day of service. Anticipated cost is estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.
W-Line – it is proposed to discontinue four of the most unproductive round-trips of the
Weekday: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:01 AM, 3:00 PM, 3:15 PM,
and 6:45 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 5:40 AM, 2:25 PM, 2:55 PM,

C/E/F-Line – It is proposed to continue the peak C and E Line service through the midday,
with each line alternating every 30 minutes. The F-Line would also run through the
midday with 30-minute service. This would create a combined 15-minute headway on the
Southeast Corridor between Belleview Station and Lincoln Station.
This proposal
increases connections to and from the W-Line at Auraria West Station and provides more
service to the Auraria at Colfax Station for students at the campus and helps alleviate the
pullin and pullout issues at the end of the morning peak period and before the afternoon
peak period. This operation requires 10 trains instead of the current 6 during the midday.
Anticipated cost is estimated to be $590,000 annualized.

adjust late night and early morning service. Late night service is proposed for changes
Sunday through Thursday nights. This change continues the span of service Sunday
through Thursday nights through 1:00 AM and reduces the frequency from 30 minutes to
60 minutes after 11:00 PM. This proposal will impact approximately 442 passengers on
Sundays and 358 passengers on Mondays-Thursdays.

Mineral Station to the Routes 77, 401, 402L, and 403 to improve transfers and make the
service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
H-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in the southbound
direction between Dayton Station and Nine Mile Station and also reschedule the bus
connections at Nine Mile Station to the Route 35, 121, 130, 131, 133, 135, and 139 to
improve transfers and make the service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
W-Line – it is proposed to adjust running times on the W-Line based on modifications in
regards to the quiet zone crossings. It is anticipated that up to one minute will be saved in
both directions, which will also help with the layover/recovery time at Jefferson County
Government Center Station. This adjustment will save an all-day train on Weekdays and
Saturdays/Sundays.
Total anticipated cost savings is estimated to be -$1,157,000 annualized.

School trippers added/adjusted:
D-Line (train 14), H-Line (train 57). Both are proposed to operate on Monday-Thursday
only, utilizing the new fourth class of service schedule.
Special Services
BroncosRide
It is proposed that RTD discontinue the following RTD BroncosRide Routes for the 2014
season: Federal Center Station BroncosRide and Market Street Station. Alternative for
the Federal Center Station will be the West Line Light Rail. With the closing of Market
Street Station, the Market Street Shuttle would be discontinued. Alternative service will
also be the West Line Light Rail (W-line), Southeast Light Rail (E-Line), operating out of
Union Station.
Due to bus constraints associated with week night games, it is also proposed that RTD
discontinue service to the Alameda & Havana PnR and East High School for weeknight
games only. Currently these two locations do not have preseason service. This proposal
will extend to any regular season weeknight games only. Alameda & Havana alternatives
will include BroncosRide out of South High School or any station along the Southeast Light
Rail Line. East High School alternative will be the Route 15Ltd which is being extended to
the Decatur-Federal Station. Approximately 150 customers will be effected each game.
Savings: Annual Savings -$6,100.

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

May 14, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2014

Subject:

Longmont fare Buy Up Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Boulder County to allow the
County to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services, herein referenced as “The 300
series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride
services for an initial period of 6 months with options to extend the buy-up period up to two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County, in cooperation with the City of Longmont, has requested that they be allowed to “buy up”
all fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of
the major reasons that ridership has declined in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective
of this action is to build ridership and prevent future service reductions by the RTD.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD up to $286,000 on an annual basis (staff estimate is
$210,000 for fixed-route plus approximately $10,000 for ADA annually) for fares on the 300 series routes
and any additional dollars for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300
series routes. This dollar amount was established based on 300 series fare revenue from 2012. Originally,
this program request was for a two year period. However, the FTA felt that this would constitute a fare
change and therefore required a fare equity analysis. The program was scaled back to a 6 month
promotional period that would run from July-December 2014. This promotional period is in line with FTA
policy and will not require a fare equity analysis. This request is for a 6 month period but would be extended
an additional 18 months if Boulder County can receive FTA approval. During the dates specified above, there
will be no fare for any passenger boarding any 300 series route. All passengers will be allowed unlimited
boardings on all 300 Series routes, in both directions, throughout the day and throughout the promotional
period. Ridership is currently about 600 boardings per day from previous highs of over 800 boardings per
day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be the same as if passengers were paying fares.
Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law enforcement will continue to have the discretion to
refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued
to any passengers requesting a transfer. This program will not include the Call-n-Ride or regional routes
operating within Longmont. The purpose of the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The Calln-Ride ridership should not be affected by this program. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within RTD service standards should ridership
increases generate a need for additional service; any new cost will be borne by Boulder County. The local
agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, will perform the majority of the marketing and
publicity for this program with the approval of RTD Marketing. RTD will promote this program at appropriate
locations on the RTD website. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold quarterly meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program. Boulder County will take the lead
organizing and hosting these meetings.

Acceptance of 2013 Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2013 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
A confidential electronic copy of the 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) has been
included in MinuteTraq. Bound copies will be provided at the meeting on May 20. We have been
advised by the auditor’s that the financial statements in the enclosed CAFR present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the District as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its
operations and its cash flow for the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

Recommendation for Contract Award to
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for the FasTracks
Construction Management Support Consultant
Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based
on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction
Management Support Consulting work for FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are
contained in the RTD FasTracks capital budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
BACKGROUND
Since the start of FasTracks, RTD has utilized the expertise of various management support consultants
to provide specialized program management expertise, fill short term staffing needs, and augment the
RTD FasTracks staff. Most of these multi-year contracts, like RTD’s current Program Support
Consultant, will reach the end of their contract terms in 2017. However, with the start of the North
Metro corridor project and the potential for future projects, RTD’s program support needs will extend
beyond 2017. Therefore, RTD decided to pursue a new consulting contract to provide ongoing support
for North Metro and future projects.
In February 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Management Support
Consulting Services for the FasTracks program, with an initial focus on the North Metro project. This
contract term would extend for six years, negotiated annually, with four (4) one-year options. On March
12, 2014, four excellent, written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:





Kleinfelder
LS Gallegos and Associates, Inc.
RockSol/CH2M HILL
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture

A five-member evaluation team was formed to review these proposals and select the best qualified
team, based on the following evaluation criteria from the RFP:
A. Understanding of Project Objectives .......................................... 25%
B. Technical and Management Approach ....................................... 30%
C. Capabilities and Experience ...................................................... 30%
D. DBE/SBE Approach, WIN Program Approach, and Creative
Strategies to Ensure Diversity and Inclusion ............................... 15%
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 57

2.12.A

After reviewing and scoring the proposals individually, the five-member evaluation team met and scored
the written proposals as a team. While there were differences in ranking the third and fourth proposals,
the reviewers had consistently ranked the top two proposals, with unanimous consent on the
recommended proposer. Additionally, both the individual and consensus scores provided enough of a
gap that a best-qualified choice was evident.
During the consensus review meeting, the proposal evaluation team discussed strengths and
weaknesses of each proposal, compared scoring, and developed a consensus score and ranking for each
firm. The Triunity-Hill JV scored the highest ranking within the criteria and was the consensus selection.
Triunity is a locally based DBE company.
The Triunity-Hill JV, which includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner, has committed to meeting
RTD’s initial DBE Goal of 27% for this Contract, and has set their own goal of 34%. Additionally,
Triunity-Hill JV has committed to meeting or exceeding RTD’s 10% WIN Program Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the FasTracks budget for each project that the firm will be
assigned.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the
amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support Consulting work for
FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are contained in the RTD FasTracks capital
budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
2. Reject all submittals and re-solicit for new proposals. This is not recommended as the evaluation
criteria was in accordance with the Brooks Act requiring a qualifications based selection. Triunity-Hill
JV’s proposal was fully responsive to the selection criteria. Also, the evaluation team was
unanimous in its recommended selection of Triunity-Hill JV; a significant endorsement of this
proposal.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the current program management approach. This is not
recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have sufficient staff available to manage the North Metro
project, and does not desire an increase in RTD staffing headcount at this late point in the program.

State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2014 through
June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of $112,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective June 30, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 1 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has done an excellent job of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$112,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action.
Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Packet Pg. 59

2.12.B

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

Resolution No.___, Series of 2014 Related to
the Issuance of RTD Certificates of
Participation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
BACKGROUND:
The Board adopted Resolution No. 1744 (Series of 2013) on November 26, 2013 expressing its
intent to raise capital to finance the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue through the issuance of
Certificates of Participation (COPs).
DISSCUSSION:
This action item discusses the financing of the North Metro Rail Line project and provides a
Resolution authorizing staff to proceed with issuing COPs to fund the portion of the project between
Denver Union Station and 104th Avenue. The portion of the North Metro Rail Line project between
104th and 124th Avenues is being funded with other funds available to the District including
previously issued FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond proceeds, local government in kind
contributions and RTD unrestricted cash.
The Resolution provides for (a) a principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District
pursuant to the Lease of up to $515,000,000 (b) maximum annual amount of Base Rentals payable
in any Fiscal Year of up to $44,000,000 and (c) a maximum net effective interest rate of 6.5%. The
District intends to reimburse itself for certain prior expenditures related to the project with the
proceeds from these COPs as outlined in the Reimbursement Resolution adopted by the Board in
December 2013.
The resolution authorizes staff to determine if obtaining municipal bond insurance for all or a portion
of the 2014A COPs is in the best interests of the District and if so, to select a bond insurer to issue
a municipal bond insurance policy and execute any related documents or agreements required to
obtain the insurance.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
COPs, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a Preliminary
Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate Purchase
Agreement, Indenture and the Certificate Resolution. The Board is being requested, through the
Certificate Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve
agreements required in connection with the issuance of the COPs.

the Underwriters of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement to all
interested persons in connection with the sale of the 2014A Certificates is hereby ratified,
approved and confirmed.
Section 6.
Authorization to Execute Collateral Documents. The Secretary or
Assistant Secretary authorized to act on behalf of the Secretary is hereby authorized and directed
to attest all signatures and acts of any official of the District in connection with the matters

and approved by this Resolution. The Chair, the Secretary and other officials and employees of

District any and all additional certificates, documents and other papers, and to perform all other
acts that they may deem necessary or appropriate in order to implement and carry out the
transactions and other matters authorized by this Resolution. The execution of any instrument by
the appropriate officers and employees of the District herein authorized shall be conclusive
evidence of the approval by the District of such instrument in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Ground Lease, the Lease, the Indenture or the 2014A Certificates shall be construed as creating
or constituting a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial
obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a
mandatory charge or requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then
current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to
the 2014A Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in
the Lease) and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by
the District in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease
nor the 2014A Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in
any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple
fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision
of the Ground Lease, the Lease or the 2014A Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as
creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the
credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado
Constitution. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease nor the 2014A Certificates shall directly or
indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated
for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the Leased Property and do not
exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to renew
the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property

Attachment: RTD Resolution - 2014A COPs (1955 : Resolution No. ___ , Series of 2014 Related to the Issuance of RTD Certificates of

pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which
the District has an option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property (i.e., the
entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the Leased Property.
Section 9.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2014A Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2014A Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 10.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.
Section 13.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall be in full force and effect
immediately upon its passage and adoption.
