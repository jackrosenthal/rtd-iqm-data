Approval of Budget Transfer for North Metro
Sidings

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way budget to a project to construct additional
track sidings (see attached) on the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL). These sidings will improve system
reliability on the entire RTD commuter rail network. They provide for a more robust, reliable operation
on the current North Metro segment to 124th Avenue and facilitate the future construction of the
remaining segment to 162nd Avenue. Funding for the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way Budget is
included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the FasTracks capital program.
BACKGROUND
Implementation of this action would advance the 2015 RTD strategic goals of: (1) advancing/completing
FasTracks; and (2) improve service delivery. One of the major challenges of FasTracks has been securing
railroad right-of-way at a cost consistent with our budget. Many challenges and unforeseen costs have
occurred. In response to these challenges, the FasTracks program had set up a Railroad Right of Way
budget of $16 million to address risks in this area. This is a programwide element and not assigned to
any specific FasTracks project
Through prudent management of this area, our projects have been able to address these railroad issues
within their project budgets and contingency. Our FasTracks projects, most of which have a high level
of interface with the railroads, are now far enough along that we are projecting that these issues can be
addressed within the project budgets without needing to use this programwide $16 million Railroad Right
of Way account.
DISCUSSION
The North Metro Rail Line is designed as a single track railroad with passing sidings. Trains in opposite
directions are scheduled to meet on these passing sidings. This can work well as long as trains operate
exactly on time with no disruptions.
However, train operations are subject to a number of factors that can cause delays including equipment
breakdowns, inclement weather, passenger boarding/medical emergency issues, power problems, etc. A
delayed train will cause the train in the opposite direction to wait at the end of a siding until it clears the
single track section. Once a delay begins, it may ripple through the scheduled service for hours,
affecting customers on other RTD trains as well as the delayed train(s). Single-track operations increase
the pressure on the operating entity to turn trains promptly at terminals within tight schedule windows;
this may require additional staff members (hostlers) to be added so that trains can run on time.
Updated computer simulations of train operations for North Metro were performed incorporating the
latest information about the alignment, performance of the Hyundai Rotem commuter rail vehicles and
positive train control (PTC). The updated simulations have shown that small delays or disruptions can
compound to create significant delays. This could lead to an inherently unreliable operation that would

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

not meet ridership expectations or result in a longer headway that provides less service. Providing
additional sidings (or reducing the length of single track) gives trains more opportunities to pass each
other without waiting, even if one train is delayed.
Delays on the NMRL can also affect the entire commuter rail network as these trains interface with
trains from the East, Gold and Northwest Rail at Denver Union Station.
In addition, installing these sidings now would facilitate the ultimate goal of construction of the entire
NMRL to 162nd Avenue. Waiting to install these sidings until later when the line is in service would be
significantly more expensive than now when the project is under construction.
RTD has previously launched enabling works on this corridor (maintenance facility expansion, double
tracking, and electrification modifications) in a similar manner before full construction was funded.
These board decisions to proceed with early enabling works were critical in RTD being able to afford the
current project to 124th Avenue.
The work on these sidings would incorporate design, trackwork, special trackwork (turnouts/crossovers),
signaling (including positive train control), electrification and communications. The work would be
performed by the Regional Rail Partners (RRP) contractor who is the design-builder for this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The work will be funded by a transfer of $16 million from the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way Budget to a project to construct

This is not

3. Do not accept the recommendation and use the $16 million for other, unbuilt FasTracks corridors.
This is not recommended as it could lead to an unreliable operation or longer headways on NMRL and
would not be sufficient to fund any other segment on FasTracks.

Utility Easement for South Weld Metropolitan
District for City of Dacono and St. Vrain
Sanitation District

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive
utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acres, more or less) on the Boulder Branch segment of
the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1 North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono,
County of Weld, State of Colorado.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets. In 2009, RTD
acquired the railroad track and land known as the Boulder Industrial Lead (BIL) in the counties of Adams,
Boulder, Broomfield and Weld. The railroad corridor is 32.7 miles in length and an average width of 161
feet. The BIL is divided into two segments: the North Metro Line and the Boulder Branch. The North
Metro line extends from Colorado Blvd at East 64th Avenue in Commerce City, Adams County,
northward to 164th Avenue just east of I-25 in unincorporated Weld County. The Boulder Branch
extends from 164th Avenue just east of I-25, Weld County, westward 17.7 miles to Boulder’s Valmont
Power Station.
In February 2014, RTD granted two Licenses on the BIL Boulder Branch to Ranchview Investment Co,
for consideration of a one-time License fee of $2,500 per License, to construct a water line and a
sanitary sewer pipeline crossing the railroad right-of-way under the track in Weld County Road 8 to serve
the Ranchview Subdivision adjacent to CR 8, City of Dacono. By the terms of a Subdivision Agreement
between Ranchview Investment Co and the City of Dacono to govern the development, the City of
Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District will undertake ownership and maintenance of the water line
and sewer line, respectively, upon completion and approval of the utilities. Two additional License
Agreements between RTD and the City of Dacono and St. Vrain Sanitation District were concurrently
executed to become effective upon final approval and acceptance of the utilities at which time the
License Agreements with Ranchview Investment Co will terminate.
DISCUSSION
The City of Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District are concerned with License Agreements that are
revocable and terminable and initially sought a permanent interest in the property to ensure the
continued use and operation of the pipelines; however, with time constraints of the subdivision
development, they agreed to execute the Licenses to facilitate the installations while continuing to
pursue an easement.
The 2009 appraisal of the BIL rail corridor, conducted by Brad A. Weiman, MAI, and John P. Baker, MAI,
of Integra Realty Resources, further divided the North Metro Line and the Boulder Branch into land use
segments for valuation. Segments 1 through 14 of the North Metro Line that are highly developed and
urban ranged in value from $1.65 to $19.30 per square foot. Segments 15 through 21 of the Boulder

Packet Pg. 19

2.B.1

Branch, with rural locations and no immediate demand for rail development, ranged in value from $0.75
to $6.00 per square foot. The requested easement area is located in Segment 15 of the Boulder Branch
that was valued at $1.50 per square foot.
South Weld Metropolitan District proposes a value based on 50% of the fee value of $1.50 per square
foot for the subsurface utility easement with an escalator of 10% or $3,100 for the 3,769 square foot
easement area.
RTD shall retain all rights in and usage of the property as necessary to ensure RTD’s use for mass
transportation system purposes. The utilities are subject to modification or relocation whenever RTD
finds it necessary or desirable in the use and improvement of the property. The utility owners shall be
required to modify, adjust or relocate all or any portion of the utilities, as RTD may designate. The utility
owners shall bear the entire cost and expense incurred in connection with the construction,
maintenance, repair and renewal and any and all modifications, revisions, relocations or reconstructions
of the utilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $3,100 in compensation for the non-exclusive utility easement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086
acre, more or less) on the Boulder Branch segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section
14, Township 1 North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
convey a non-exclusive utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acre, more or less) on the
Boulder Branch segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1 North,
Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado. This is not recommended as
RTD is receiving fair market value for the easement and the easement does not limit current or future
RTD actions.

just ridership and revenue
- Other benefits of TOC may
include affordable housing,
urban design, station amenities

• Each TOD project is unique
• Ensure everyone
