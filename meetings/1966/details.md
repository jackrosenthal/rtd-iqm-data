#### 1. Approval of Budget Transfer for North Metro Sidings

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way budget to a project to construct additional track sidings (see attached) on the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL).  These sidings will improve system reliability on the entire RTD commuter rail network.  They provide for a more robust, reliable operation on the current North Metro segment to 124th Avenue and facilitate the future construction of the remaining segment to 162nd Avenue.  Funding for the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way Budget is included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the FasTracks capital program.
