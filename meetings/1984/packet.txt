New Starts Funding: Appropriations Outlook
§ Omnibus or CR? Transportation appropriators in the House and
Senate are negotiating from their respective FY 2015 THUD bills,
rather than rolling transportation spending into a continuing
resolution at FY 2014 levels.
§ The House and Senate top-line funding numbers are not far apart:
§ $70.2 billion in House
§ $71.7 billion in Senate

§ But policy disagreements remain, including the House bill’s
elimination of transit eligibility from the popular TIGER program.
§ Current spending authority for all federal government programs
ends on December 11.

Securing New Starts funding for EAGLE P3
FasTracks projects
Our Agenda:
§ Work to ensure RTD receives full $150 million in recommended
funding for the ongoing Eagle FFGA.
§ Push forward for Southeast Extension funding against

headwinds:

§ Demand has long exceeded available New Starts funding:

pipeline of projects awaiting grants.

§ Greater competition: expanded eligibility for Core Capacity

projects funded at $275 million in FY 2015.

MAP-21 Reauthorization: Funding Fix is Job 1
§ Congress passed a short-term revenue patch and MAP-21 program
extension through the end of May 2015, then immediately pivoted to
the larger funding and policy challenges of the next long-term surface
transportation bill.
§ The highway trust fund revenue crisis has been deferred – not solved.
§ Upcoming decisions on funding sources and levels will govern many
of the policy and program decisions for the next bill.
§ Meanwhile, our infrastructure investment gap is growing:
§ Ever-increasing transit ridership, and
§ Record-high $86 billion backlog of system preservation needs,
estimated to continue expanding at $2.5 billion per year at current
spending levels.

So how do we pay for it?

§ About $15 billion in new revenue per year is needed just to maintain
current spending levels, no program growth.
§ The available options are widely known and debated: no silver
bullet, only hard choices:
§ Cut transportation programs to align with current revenues.
§ Another short-term patch with general fund revenues ($62 billion

transferred to the HTF since FY 2008).

§ Raise additional long-term revenues, mainly from user fees.

MAP-21 Reauthorization: Likely Scenarios
§ Infrastructure investment still finds bicameral, bipartisan support in
Congress.
§ Spending priorities may change in the new Congress, but drastic cuts
to bring programs in line with current HTF revenues are not likely.
§ Congressional staff are now drafting bills assuming current funding
levels plus inflation; we must keep making the case for revenue
increases needed for program growth.
§ Revenue fix in the Lame Duck?
§ Unlikely but not impossible for Congress to address HTF revenues
in the lame duck session; some momentum in the Senate.
§ More likely in the new Congress as part of a larger tax package or
budget reconciliation.

Federal Funding Uncertainty: What could this
mean for RTD?

“The lack of stability and predictability of Federal dollars
hampers any major commitments for new projects. It also
hampers local elected officials and others in their vision for
what they want to do for their communities.”
Acting FTA Administrator Therese McMillan
before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee
November 13, 2014

RTD Reauthorization Strategy:
§ Your message must be heard in Washington if you want to achieve
your vision for the Denver region.
§ While support for infrastructure remains a bright spot in an otherwise
divided and unproductive Congress, raising revenues is unpopular
and always challenging.
§ Keep making the case for much-needed infrastructure investment:
§ Ensure RTD continues to receive its fair share of transit funding.
§ Influence and shape policy decisions being made now:
§ Flexibility in the definition of BRT projects eligible for New Starts funding
§ FTA’s use of the horizon year for calculating New Starts project benefits
§ Streamlining, integration of the TIFIA and New Starts processes

Maintaining Stakeholder Engagement
§ New players and new roles on Capitol Hill: keep Congressional
stakeholders informed and on board with RTD’s most important
issues.
§ New make-up of Colorado Congressional delegation:
§ Meet with new Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and newly-elected
Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO-04) on RTD’s latest challenges and
successes, including progress on North Metro rail line, US 36 BRT,
and the Southeast Corridor Extension project.
§ After the elections, several Members of Congress are in new
leadership positions on transportation committees; it is critical to
meet with these new Members.
