## V. Public Participation

- Richard Castro, Denver Health and administrator of the Eastside Public Health Center, advocated on behalf of the 29th and Welton Station.  He indicated this clinic serves the elderly, the pregnant, families with children and otherwise disadvantaged and disenfranchised.  Transportation is a key issue for his clients and they are heavily dependent on public transportation.  He sees approximately 300-350 patients per day, 2-300 for the pharmacy and they rely on the light rail to get them to the clinic.  He feels discontinuing this stop will be a hardship on the clients and would be detrimental to the community and healthcare.

- Joel Nobel from the Curtis Park neighborhood which is adjacent to this location indicated that the on-time performance has improved since the closing of the station; the data and rider experience are clear that this test has been successful.  He said that when viewed narrowly, the results would suggest that the station needs to be closed; however, there are other issues to be resolved there. It is still only 66% on-time so this still needs to be looked at. He noted that when his group polled the neighborhood to see if they used the station and why, they heard that many people did. They believe this is good stop spacing and feel safe at this location. There is another legitimate concern about what happens to the station.  They do not want it to become blight within the community. He stated that people do not feel safe at the 30th & Welton station.  He said they had many problems with lights being out, a situation that he had appealed to RTD earlier and this has only gotten fixed after Denver police intervention.

- Tracy Winchester, Executive Director of the Five Points Business District which is a non-profit organization representing business and property owners in the Welton Street Corridor, thanked RTD for working with them and in creating a world-class transportation modal center.  She expressed that her purpose for being here was to address the concerns over the permanent closure of the 29th & Welton Station.  She stated that before a decision is made, there needs to be more than the criteria of on-time performance to close the station.  RTD and the community need to look at economic development and safety. Safety is the number one issue as to why her community would like to see the station re-opened.  She also feels that the economic development needs to be considered.  The light rail gives permanence and credibility to developers that want to come in and revitalize the area.  She believes that closing a station and leaving it as a blighted area in the community really has a chilling effect for any developers.  She requested RTD to hold off on making a permanent decision until the safety issue is resolved at 30th & Downing which gives residents an opportunity to get off at 29th and Welton Station where they feel safe.  She also asked the Board to keep the Central Corridor Mobility Study in consideration as they make their decision.

- Doug Gragg also complimented RTD on the implementation of the audio system on the buses.  He asked to speak with someone regarding a technical question.  He shared that he had a wonderful time coming down to the meeting on the RTD system because he experienced very good service.  His driver was Lisa and she did not know that he was coming to attend a Board meeting.  Doug Gragg stated that she exhibited remarkable personal ability through many trials and tribulations from very challenging customers; she gave what he would call A+ service.

- Ricky Martinez, RMR, said that he has been threatened with legal action by Jim Martinez, President of RMR.  He stated that after being treated poorly on the job site it is uncomfortable to endure this kind of treatment.  He feels the Board should be aware of these incidents.

- Josh Garcia stated that he owns Unification Point, a business near the 29th and Welton Station.  He asked the Board to give more consideration to re-opening the station.  There are four brand new businesses in the area, three of which have open door policies.  He said this is the first year his company has been in business; he believes it would greatly benefit his business if this station remained open.  Josh Garcia said that he has also had several clients express concern about their safety at the 30th and Downing Station.

- Brady Bratcher from Peoria, stated that he and another gentleman went to the offices of RMR to get an OSHA report.  He said that while they were there they decided to apply for work.  Brady Bratcher stated that just because they were affiliated with the union Jim Martinez called the police.  He noted that the National Labor Relations Board found merit on the charges that were filed against RMR while Jim Martinez informed the Board the exact opposite.  Mr. Martinez agreed that he would not violate federal law and was required to inform employees of their rights.  Brady Bratcher commented that most of the time unfair labor practices are committed by front line supervisors but all of the unfair practices of RMR are committed by Jim Martinez himself.

- Jim Toweill, Ironworkers Union, stated that he needed to respond to comments that were made by RMR’s owner.  He noted that Jim Martinez made the claim that he made some mistakes regarding prevailing wages; however, Jim Toweill pointed out that there are dozens of instances of RMR having to make restitution in 2010, 2011 and 2012.  He said that it is very difficult for him to believe that these are mistakes and will not happen again.  Jim Toweill believes that unless there are some prequalifications this will continue to happen.  He commented that Jim Martinez told the Board that people were wearing t-shirts that said RMR abuses workers while in fact his group was wearing t-shirts that say Respect our Rights.  Jim Toweill also noted that this is not just about Jim Martinez but the many other people involved with the company.

- Reverend Daniel Klawitter said that he is the Chairperson of the Interfaith Workers Justice Committee.  His organization is a small group of clergy that believes that all workers should be treated with dignity and respect.  Reverend Klawitter stated that when he heard the concerns of the workers he agreed to lead an effort to speak with RMR.  He said that at RMR’s office he was able to speak briefly with Tom Ward through a door.  Reverend Klawitter noted that despite the fact that he was in his clergy collar and gave him his card he was immediately threatened with arrest.  He noted that he was left feeling that if he was treated that way how must the workers be being treated.

- Louis Apolinar, RMR, reiterated the comments of Ricky Martinez.  He stated that Jim Martinez threatened to sue them as striking workers.  Louis Apolinar said that they complained to the NLRB that Jim Martinez intimidated and harassed workers and the NLRB found merit to the charges.  He noted that rather than have the NLRB take official action Mr. Martinez agreed to put up posters.  Louis Apolinar shared that he was a witness to many abuses on RMR projects where they forced employees to run with rebar and seek water from Kiewit.

## IX. Chair's Report

- Chair Anderson reported that a number of Board members had attended the Rail~Volution conference and this was a great conference.  They had a chance to visit the different transit properties.  She noted one of the differences between the RTD agency and Seattle is RTD is one regional transit whereas there are several min transit working together in Seattle.

## X. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington informed the Board that the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Conference was held in Denver.  FTA Administrator Rogoff was in town along with the Federal Highway Association.  He said that there was a technical tour that went to Denver Union Station (DUS).  Everyone was very impressed the development and multi-modal nature of DUS.

- General Manager Washington shared that the Transportation Research Board (TRB) had a luncheon at the AASHTO Conference that was well attended.  The Chair of the TRB Executive Committee was the Keynote Speaker, Deb Jones.  He said that she spoke about how the railroads work.  General Manager Washington thought it was very interesting, especially as RTD goes through some of the issues with the North West Rail.

- General Manager Washington will be giving a presentation on FasTracks November 1st to the University of Denver’s Law School Land Use Leadership Alliance Group run by Susan Daggett.

- General Manager Washington stated that he was happy to say that RTD will be resuming bus service to Lyons.  Lyons was very isolated due to flood but staff worked with CDOT and the Colorado State Highway Patrol so that service can be resumed on November 4th.

- General Manager Washington shared that on November 14th RTD will be visited by a delegation from Boston.  This delegation, headed by Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority CEO Beverly Scott, will be coming to learn about how RTD manages our Capital Programs so we can bring them in under budget and ahead of schedule.  They will also be learning about the Workforce Initiative Now program.

- General Manager Washington said that as the Board is aware, there has been a lot of discussion about certain controversial bus and rail ads.  He noted that staff will bring this subject back to the Board next month for discussion.  There are various options as to how these ads are handled and the Board will need to make that decision.

- General Manager Washington shared that last week RTD lost two long term employees.  This was a tremendous loss to the District; these were two ladies who were truly outstanding in their work.  He said that there is a lot of grieving going on throughout the agency.  The two employees are Jackie Stiggers and Sandy Duran who collectively had more than 68 years of institutionalized knowledge.

Chair Anderson asked General Manager Washington to pass on the condolences of the Board to their families and co-workers.

Amendment to

Primary Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to amend the January 2014 Service Changes to remove the permanent closure of the 29th & Welton Station.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Anderson called on the General Manager for his comments.

General Manager Washington began by providing the Board the background of why RTD closed the 29th and Welton station.  He stated that approximately one year ago staff looked at the service RTD is providing along the Welton Street Corridor.  General Manager Washington reminded the Board that this area is a single track with on-time performance issues.  He noted that as the Board may be aware, there are three stops within a four block area: 27th and Welton, 29th and Welton, and 30th and Downing.  General Manager Washington stated that in looking to see how we could become more operationally efficient one of staff’s ideas was to close one of the stations and the middle station seemed more likely.

General Manager Washington shared that the community requested a trial closure of the station to see if we would gain the operational efficiencies expected.  After the trial period staff found that we did achieve those efficiencies so the permanent closure was included in this service change package.

Jessie Carter commented that on-time performance is 66% when looking at the Welton segment by itself; looking at the line as a whole it has moved up to 89%.

General Manager Washington noted that these efficiencies impact the entire system; the entire system realized the operational efficiencies that staff was seeking.

General Manager Washington stated that security is an issue.  Staff is working with the Denver Police Department (DPD) to ensure safety at 30th and Downing, just like they work with local police throughout the system.  He reiterated that staff works with the local authorities to stamp out crime and will continue to do so.  General Manager Washington commented that the statement made by a speaker that RTD was forced to replace lights at a station is not accurate.  Staff looks around our system very frequently and makes those State of Good Repairs quickly.

General Manager Washington said that the Central Corridor Study is currently underway and set to be complete in August.  He noted that if the study identifies a different mobility option we would not be able to use the infrastructure that is there.

General Manager Washington stated that if the Board approves the permanent closing of the station he would direct staff to demolish the infrastructure all together so there is no blight.  General Manager Washington pointed out that there is already huge economic development in the area even with the station closed.

General Manager Washington indicated that it is the Board’s prerogative to keep the station open but stressed that we will lose operational efficiency in the whole system.

Bruce Abel reinforced General Manager Washington’s comments.  He commented that in some respects the term operational efficiencies seems impersonal; what staff is really trying to do is improve RTD’s customer service.  He said the goal of this is so our customers can catch the train when they expect and make their connections.  This will improve service for the entire system.  Bruce Abel noted that staff agrees with the comments that there is continued room for improvement which they plan to pursue; staff’s ultimate objective is to continue to improve customer service.

Director Deadwyler stated that she would like to see the station remain status quo which would be temporarily closed.   She feels there are many things in the Welton Corridor that have not been decided.  Director Deadwyler believes this will give the community the opportunity to determine if this is even the appropriate station to be closed.  She is concerned that RTD has not discussed with the citizens if this is the station they would like closed as it is very important to the community.

Director Folska stated her support for Director Deadwyler’s motion.  She wondered when the station was opened and why staff was just now recommending that it be closed.  She also wondered if RTD would see higher efficiencies if an additional station were closed.  Jessie Carter stated that it was opened in 1994.  He noted that it is important to know the number of boardings at each station.  30th and Downing sees about 3,200 boardings per day, 29th and Welton saw about 200 boardings per day before it was closed, and 27th and Welton sees about 300 boardings per day. Jessie Carter said that if we closed 27th and Downing we would see additional operational efficiencies but closing the terminal would make operation very difficult so closing 30th and Downing is not an option.  Director Folska stated that there was another attack at 30th and Downing on October 30th.  She commented that the station that is causing the most trouble is the station that will remain.

Director Folska believes we should wait to close the station.  She stated that the RTD Board serves at the pleasure of the citizens.  Those citizens paid to have the station put there and they came to the meeting to tell the Board how important it is.  Director Folska also hopes that RTD will listen to what the studies have to say before making a decision.

Director Walker wondered the time-frame for being able to remove the station.  He also wondered if the temporary closure could be extended; he asked if there are funds associated with keeping the station as-is in its temporary status.  General Manager Washington stated that the station could be removed in as little at 45 to 60 days, if not less.  He said that we could continue to bypass the station and it does not cost much to maintain.  Director Walker commented that in Seattle and Cleveland where lines run through dense areas the stations are miles apart.  He expressed that it has puzzled him as to why these stations are so close.  Jessie Carter noted that the 29th station is 470 feet away from 30th and Downing and 750 feet away from 27th.

Director Lubow indicated that she is inclined to support the motion.  She believes staff has made a compelling case that there is some efficiency gained by bypassing the station but she thinks the public participants raised a reasonable doubt that this is something that should be irreversible.  Director Lubow wants to give this decision more time so the community can come forward and see if there is a better way to handle this.

Director Rivera-Malpiede said that she also supports the motion.  She wants to see what is going to come of the studies that are currently on the table.  She believes the closure should remain temporary until the Board and staff know what is being recommended by the studies.

Director Sisk asked for additional information regarding the lights being out at the 30th and Downing station.  He noted that if we do not have standards and are not responding quickly it is important to know.  Director Sisk feels that it is important for RTD to support the community.  He believes the action is premature at this point.

Director Menten asked if a subcontractor would be responsible for the station removal if it was permanently closed.  She also wondered if RTD would continue to maintain the station until it is demolished.  General Manager Washington stated that removal would be a combination of in-house and subcontractors.  He said that RTD would absolutely continue to maintain the station until it is removed.

Director Deadwyler noted that while Jessie Carter says it is only a short distance between the stations there is a safety issue.  She has a daughter that used to use the 29th station and now she has to walk to 30th.  There is no visibility going around the corner making it doubly unsafe to make the walk.

Director James wanted to clarify that if the amendment is not approved then the station would be classified as permanently closed in contrast to its current status as temporarily closed.  He asked if the removal of the station components would be a consequence of the reclassification.  General Manager Washington stated that Director James was correct.  Director James wondered what consequences there would be in terms of cost if the station remained temporarily closed.  General Manager Washington explained that if the amendment is approved the physical infrastructure will stay in place but RTD will continue to temporarily bypass the station.  He said that there are some maintenance costs associated with upkeep of the station to make sure it does not go into a state of blight.

General Manager Washington noted that regardless of the outcome of the Central Corridor Study, RTD will likely not use that infrastructure again.  If Light Rail is the mode that comes out of the study, staff’s recommendation will still be to close the station for operational reasons.  If another mobility option comes out of the study the infrastructure cannot be used.  He stated that staff would then again recommend that the infrastructure be torn out.

Director Hoy reiterated that since the station has been temporarily closed on-time performance of the entire line has improved.  He believes that the chances of the Board making a decision in the future to reopen the station and slow down the entire line are zero.  He said that he would not come back and say he thought that was a good idea.  Director Hoy stated that he will vote no on the amendment.

Director Folska noted that the amendment put forth by Director Deadwyler is to maintain the station at 29th as closed on a temporary basis until RTD receives the details of the study.  She commented that if the study comes back and recommends a street car then all of the line will need to be ripped out.  She thinks it would be more effective to demolish it all at once taking advantage of economies of scale than in bits and pieces.  General Manager Washington stated that the idea that the study will come back in August and RTD will have money to build the Central Corridor in September is not realistic; it may be years before RTD can do any of the recommendations.

Director Bagley commented that as Jessie Carter mentioned, overall efficiency has gone to 89-91% on the D-Line; the station closure affects the whole D-Line.  He stated that he will never vote for maintaining the full operation of the station whenever the vote comes up.  He will support staff’s recommendation.  Director Bagley noted that this decision may be put off for some time but when it comes down to deciding what will happen it needs to be permanently closed from his perspective as a D-Line Director based on what he hears from his constituents.

Director Daly asked Austin Jenkins why these back-ups are now an issue.  Austin Jenkins said that he thinks staff has laid out the issues pretty clearly.  He noted that he is agnostic about the station; he cares more about the system as a whole.  He explained that the impact happens at 16th and Stout every day because every train that comes through the mall is dependent on the most unreliable portion of the line.  Austin Jenkins stated that clearly we are a system and we need to recognize that everything affects something else.

Chair Anderson stated that she will be voting against the amendment.  She is concerned that all of the public participants have an expectation that the station will open again.  Chair Anderson does not want to raise the community’s expectations that the station will be reopened if it is put on temporary life support.  She reiterated what General Manager Washington said that it does not make any difference whatsoever as to the mode of transportation that the study recommends.  Chair Anderson pointed out that in fact, GM Washington said that if the station is opened it will destroy efficiencies throughout the whole system.  She highlighted that this is about one block between stations.  Chair Anderson said that she has also heard the concern about crime in the area but to her that is a totally different issue.  If 30th and Downing is dangerous then that station needs to be fixed by the DPD.  Chair Anderson reiterated that RTD needs to make sure we run our system efficiently and get people to where they need to go on-time.

Director Lubow noted that she is not convinced that the 27th Street station is off the table for being closed as an alternative.  She feels that can be explored fairly quickly so she still supports the amendment.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she agrees with all the Directors comments.  She said that she believes crime has always been an issue; this is a community issue for the City Council, DPD and RTD.  Director Rivera-Malpiede is voting to find out what will come out of the study.  She thinks that when working with communities of diversity RTD needs to take a step back and not do anything at this point.  She wants to go one step at a time.

Director Solano stated that he sees both arguments.  He wondered if any type of forecasting will be done to determine the population growth in the area that might indicate a need for the station in the future.  He thought it might make sense to temporarily leave the station until we have these forecasts.

Director Walker commented that it seems like under no circumstances will the station be opened if light rail continues to operate in that corridor.  It also seems like under no circumstances will the station be viable if a new technology is installed.  Director Walker stated that he fully intended to support the amendment but he does not think it makes sense now.  He feels it will be better to remove the station than hold out false hope that the station might be reopened.

## XIII. Old Business

Director Solano stated that he would like to make a comment regarding the RMR conundrum that keeps arising.  I would like to quote from President Abraham Lincoln.

“Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital.  Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.  Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.”

## XIV. New Business
