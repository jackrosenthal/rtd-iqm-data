BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit “Legacy” Customers

May 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On March 24, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the May 2020 Service Changes, as amended,
which established a category of “legacy” customers for RTD’s paratransit services. Per the Board of
Directors Recommended Action Item from the March 24, 2020, monthly Board meeting agenda packet,
this was defined as follows:
COMMITMENT TO PARATRANSIT CUSTOMERS
Access-a-Ride is our federally mandated, ADA-compliant, complementary paratransit
service. The service is provided during the same service hours as fixed-route buses and is
offered within ¾ of a mile of fixed-route bus service and within ¾ of a mile from a rail
station.
While we finalize work on the new service deployment for fixed-route service, we are
keenly aware of how any reductions to fixed-route services might impact the ability of our
Access-a-Ride paratransit customers to gain access to service.
RTD is committed to our Access-a-Ride customers, and we understand the best way to
continue to meet the needs of this at-risk population is to grandfather in customers who
might be impacted in those areas where all fixed-route service is eliminated.
Grandfathering, i.e. the continuation of service to existing Access-a-Ride customers in
areas where all fixed-route service is eliminated due to the May service deployment, is
recommended by staff as a solution to this concern. Upon approval of this action by the
Board, staff will work with its Call Center team and software provider to adjust training
and update software to assure that Access-a-Ride paratransit service to those customers
who are grandfathered in is offered at the same levels and in the same areas as those
immediately prior to the May service changes.
DISCUSSION

1.F.1

While the Board of Directors approved granting “legacy” status to those customers who were existing
Access-a-Ride customers at the time the May 2020 Changes were approved, in practice, the locations
themselves have continued to remain active. This is inconsistent with what was approved by the Board
of Directors, and staff is seeking Board guidance regarding the path forward.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
When an analysis was completed in September 2020, the estimated financial impact of continuing to
provide service within the “legacy” locations was estimated to be at least $2.8 million annually.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
August 2025 Service Change Recommendations

June 11, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the
August 2025 Service Change proposal facilitates opportunities for Service Development Division staff to
adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit network and Operations Department personnel to select new
work assignments.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels, operators in training, and anticipated attrition, the August 2025
service change recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward the availability of
staff. The recommendations are centered on continued SOP/COA implementation, necessary rail
reconstruction efforts and seasonal adjustments, and improving system performance and reliability by
way of service enhancements, reductions, and adjustments.
The August 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP/COA-related increases and
optimizations. Among the more notable changes are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Service reconfiguration of Routes 29, 20, 31, 35, and 36 in the South Federal area
Service reconfiguration Route 38 -West 38th and implementation of Route 34 – Bruce Randoph
Avenue
Increases to service frequency on Route 135 – Smoky Hill Road
Increase of service on the FF2 – Boulder /Denver Express
Reintroduction of the FF4 – Boulder Junction/Civic Center service
Reintroduction of the LX2 – Longmont/Denver Express

Following RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power availability, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement with the ATU,
and adjusting service levels to match ridership demand.

Packet Pg. 16

1.F.2

The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
SOP/COA-Related Changes
The following recommended changes are reflective of service provision as contemplated in the SOP/COA
of RTD’s transit network services adopted by the Board of Directors on July 26, 2022, as a component
of Reimagine RTD:
Route 29 – Riverbend: Route 29 replaced by extended trips on the Route 30 – South Federal.
Route 30 – South Federal: southbound trips on Route 30 extended from Federal and Evans to
Littleton/Downtown Station.
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard: trips from Federal and Evans Transfer Center to Federal/Evans on Route

1.F.2

Rail Reconstruction-Related Changes
The following recommendations coincide with the Kalamath Rail Reconstruction project, which will
temporarily impede access to the Central Corridor:
D Line – 18th/California Station to Mineral Station: service to be diverted to DUS during the construction
project.
E Line – DUS to RidgeGate Parkway Station: schedule adjustments to better coordinate with the addition
of the D line into DUS.
H Line – 18th/California Station to Florida Station: due to DUS track capacity limitations, H Line to
terminate at Southmoor Station.
L Line – 30th/Downing Station to 16th/Stout Station: service suspended due to construction on the
Kalamath segment and high-block replacement efforts along the Welton segment.
R Line – Lincoln Station to Peoria Station: trip time adjustments to accommodate schedule changes
anticipated on the E and H Lines.
W Line – DUS to Jefferson County Government – Golden Station: trip time adjustments are
recommended to better coordinate the operation of the addition of D line service into DUS.

no loss in coverage or frequency.
Anticipated cost: 7 FTE weekdays, 10 FTE Saturdays, and 11 FTE Sundays
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard
As listed in the System Optimization Plan, a reduction of trips on Route 31 on Sundays only

expanded coverage provided by changes to Route 30.
Anticipated cost savings: 1 PTE Sundays
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Extend eastbound trips of the Route 32 from Denver Union Station to Civic Center Station
along 15th and 17th Streets, increasing distribution capacity in the downtown area.
Anticipated cost: None

• weekday service from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. with 15-minute peak frequency and
30-minute base period service (60-minute service in late periods).
• Saturday service would operate 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. at a 30-minute frequency
(60-minute service in late periods).
• As an amendment to the SOP, Sunday service would be maintained at the frequency
currently provided by the eastern segment of Route 38 from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
Anticipated cost: cost offset by changes recommended for Route 38
Route 35 – Hampden Avenue
Reroute trips of Route 35 between Federal/Evans and Wadsworth/Hampden Park-and-Ride,
covering areas no longer served by Route 30, due to its extension to Littleton/Downtown
Station. The recommendation also includes the truncation of Route 35 south of
Wadsworth/Hampden, to eliminate service duplication to Long/Bowles, as detailed in the
System Optimization Plan (SOP). Per the SOP, service frequency would be increased to 30
minutes for most of the day. Additionally, it is recommended to replace the seasonal tripper
service on the Route 30 with a tripper on Route 35, covering the same area and time as the
previously discontinued seasonal tripper service.

As described in the System Optimization Plan, it is proposed to move weekday Route AB2
trips from Downtown Boulder Station to Boulder Junction Depot Square Station, on
weekdays as the station is to be reopened with the reinstatement of Route FF4 - Boulder
Junction/ Civic Center Station. Current Saturday AB2 trips would be renamed to AB3 to
mitigate any confusion, as these trips would continue to operate from Downtown Boulder
Station. Route AB3 would operate on Saturdays only.
Anticipated cost: None

space shortage that has been in place for multiple years. With service being reimplemented
per the System Optimization Plan moving routes 208, 225, DASH and JUMP to the new
gates will free up gate space for current regional routes, layover and recovery, as well as
needed space for Loop Extras (back-up buses). Routes DASH and JUMP would be in the
gates facing northbound on 14th Street, while routes 208 and 225 would be in the gates
facing southbound
