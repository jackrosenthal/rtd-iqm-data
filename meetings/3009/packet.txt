Date:

Subject:

RTD Boundary Certification & Director District
Designation

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: June 2, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description to reflect three new
annexations in the Town of Erie. It is further recommended that all three of these newly annexed parcels
be assigned to District I (Director Lubow).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals for 2020:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (b), any area annexed by an inDistrict municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. In this particular
case, the Town of Erie has annexed three parcels into the Town. Since parts of the Town are in the
District, any annexations by the Town automatically become included in RTD. The Board is not being
asked to approve the annexations, but to authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and
description to reflect the new annexations, and to assign the newly annexed areas to a specific Director
District.
The Town of Erie annexations are as follows.
Annexation
I-25 North Parcel
I-25 South Parcel
Swink

Acreage
99.83
155.29
150.29

Adjacent Director District
I
I
I

The land involved in all three annexations encompasses approximately 405 acres or approximately 0.63
square miles. All of the properties are undeveloped or farmland. All three parcels are adjacent to Director
District I (Director Lubow).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that as these properties
develop, depending on the mix of uses, they will generate sales tax revenue for the District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and

From:

Heather McKillop,

Subject:

2019 CAFR and Report to Governance

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: June 3, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: June 9, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2019 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. RTD is also required
to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government organizations to
be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual documents. The
accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2019 audit. In addition to the requirements set forth
in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of
1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RTD as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the 2019 and
2018 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the
year ended December 31, 2019 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2019 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD’s independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources, such as rating
agencies and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into
the record.

Regional Transportation District

June 3, 2020

In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the enclosed Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2019, has been compiled. Responsibility for the accuracy of the
presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD. Management believes
the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating results of RTD. Disclosures necessary to enable the reader
to gain the maximum understanding of the financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls.
These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United
States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the financial
statements, notes thereto and supplemental information.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of RTD, demographics, and
other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of RTD’s financial statements
performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section
of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished without the dedicated efforts of the
entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer.
Respectfully submitted,
Angie Rivera-Malpiede
Chair, Executive Committee

Regional Transportation District

June 3, 2020

State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the close of each fiscal year a
complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant
to that requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD. Consequently, management assumes
full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable
basis for making these representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control framework that
is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable information
for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not
outweigh their benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather
than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As management, we assert that,
to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of
the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2019, are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor
concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally mandated “Single Audit” designed to
meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent
auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal requirements involving
the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial
statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement
the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado General Assembly (Assembly)
found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found that public

sector involvement was the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional Transportation
District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public
mass transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of Broomfield, and portions
of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.09 million people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile area.

RTD employs over 2,956 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county areas. In addition, RTD
contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride, fixed route and commuter rail services employing over 2,058 men and
women. Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding purchased
transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities of its component unit,
the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of
lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All departments of RTD are required to
submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses
these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed budget
to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the
proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within the budget. Budget-to-actual
comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is considered in the broader
perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most populated area of the state and
the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies
represent a diverse mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic balance
in employment centers.

Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents to serve four-year terms
to govern RTD. There are approximately 200,000 residents per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for
setting policy, overseeing the agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.

The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2020 report forecasts that the economy is changing by the hour based on

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the “Amendment”) that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the
District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the
Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the Southeast and Southwest light rail
lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to
1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted
the District from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program.
At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate
the transit system financed through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP), which is the six-year operating
and capital improvement plan for RTD including both the Base System and FasTracks. This plan was previously made up of
two separate components known as the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for the Base System and the Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) for FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation planning program for the Denver metropolitan
area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG). While the MTFP is developed separately for the Base
System and FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium and long-term Financial Plan which includes the entirety
of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the development of RTD’s annual budget.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing activities and to optimize
those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the costs of a
control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgment by management.

Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators:

2.11.B.a

Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an adequate internal control structure
is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to those programs. This internal control
structure is subject to periodic evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.

Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as necessary due to modification.
The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments, expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting,
accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly manage its assets and liabilities.
Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes
financing capital projects beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax
credit as “Aa1”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit
“AA” that are secured by the 0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and
Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA” that are secured by the
0.4% sales tax.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection of investment principal while
providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes
in eligible investments, benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed
securities. The total average return on investments for the year was 1.4%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets and
control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is self-insured for liability, the
limits of which are $387,000 per person and $1,093,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity statute. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts
above this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $500,000,000 for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock
(other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for CDL Testing Performance
Bond; $2,600,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond; Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD business;
fiduciary coverage on the Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union
Trust, Legal Trust, and the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees with a limit of
$8,000,000; Cyber Liability policy with a limit of $10,000,000; Drone policy with a limit of $10,000,000. With the growth of
Light Rail Transit (LRT) services, and Commuter Rail Transit (CRT) services. RTD has added Railroad Protective and Railroad
Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when required under operational needs.
OTHER INFORMATION
Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The accounting firm
of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2019 audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the

Attachment: I. a. RTD 2019 CAFR (4230 : 2019 CAFR and Report to Governance)

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control structure, including that portion
related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2019 found no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant
violations of applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.

2.11.B.a

Federal Single Audit 2 CFR 200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the financial statements and
schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is
included in a separate report.

In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish an easily readable
and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards.
This report must also satisfy both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report meets
the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely basis was made possible by the
dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division. Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation for the
contributions made in the preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors, preparation of this report would
not have been possible.
Sincerely,
Heather McKillop
Chief Financial Officer

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial
statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.

Independent Auditors’ Report

2.11.B.a

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the changes
in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 35 and 86 through 89, respectively, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which considers
it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements
in an appropriate operational, economic or historical context. We have applied certain
limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted
of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries,
the basic financial statements and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the
basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the
information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to
express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, introductory section and statistical section are
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic
financial statements.
The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated
June 3, 2020 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and
on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and
grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope
of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results
of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting
or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and compliance.

2.11.B.a

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this narrative overview and analysis
of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader
to focus on significant financial activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of dollars.

In fiscal year 2016 RTD implemented the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 72, Fair Value
Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is to enhance the comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures to provide
comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total liabilities and deferred inflows
of resources by $3,336,878 and $3,463,506 respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2019 was
$(165,410) compared to $(207,306) in 2018. RTD’s unrestricted net position was negatively impacted by the implementation of GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68). GASB 68 required RTD to record the amount of unfunded
pension liabilities. More information on the pension plans is available in the Notes.
The net position of RTD decreased by $126,628 (3.7%) during the current year compared to an increase of $49,997 (1.5%) in the previous
year. The decrease for 2019 was due to additional depreciation on assets that were placed in service during 2018 and 2019 due to the
opening of additional rail lines as well as expensing interest costs on the Eagle P3 project that had previously been recorded as prepaid
items. The 2018 increase was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax collections increases a one-time gain recognized for a
bond refunding, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues increased $25,226 (4.0%) in 2019 and
increased $36,005 (6.0%) in the previous year. In 2019 and 2018, The District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased
consumer and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth in both years of 1.4%, low unemployment
of 3.6% and 3.3% as well as growth in personal income of 5.3% and 5.4%, respectively.
For 2019, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue and expenses of $837,088
compared to a loss of $713,392 for 2018. The increase in operating loss for 2019 and 2018 was mostly due to FasTracks depreciating
assets for a full year and betterments for the North Metro. RTD anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating
sales and use tax, grant revenues and other miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $69,194 (2.0%) and decreased $68,788 (2.0%) in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Debt decreased in 2019 and
2018 due to payment of principal.
Capital grants and local contributions increased $43,495 (53.4%) in 2019 and decreased 5,393 (6.2%) in the previous year. The increase
in 2019 was a result of Eagle P3 project grant funding. The decrease in 2018 was a result of South East Rail Extension being in final phase
of completion.
RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $297,820 (3.3%) in 2019 and increased $312,270 (3.6%) in 2018. The increase in
both 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to the build-out of the FasTracks project.

Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s financial statements are
prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the same basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises.
Under this method of accounting, an economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used. Revenue is recorded
when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.

The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve
as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and expenses of RTD for the
fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change in
net position for the year. That change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end
of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the changes occurs,
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from operating activities, capital, and
related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and investing activities. The result of these activities added to the
beginning of the year cash balance reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements
of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the following: RTD’s ability
to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and
operating income (loss); and the effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the data provided in the statements
of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,342 square mile area in and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are
supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area. The 0.4%
sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for
enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance,
investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.
Financial Analysis
Condensed Financial Information - Condensed financial information from the statements of net position and statements of revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.3
Statements of Net Position – As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded
total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,336,878 and $3,463,506, respectively. The largest portion of this excess, in 2019
and in 2018, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to provide public transportation services to
customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets is reported net of
related debt, it should be noted that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as sales and use tax, since
the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2019
was $(165,410) compared to $(207,306) in 2018. Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, has
been appropriated or reserved by the RTD Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy requirements, and debt liquidation during

In 2019, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $9,362 for acquisition of revenue equipment, buildings, land, and
construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks program.
Current liabilities decreased $17,214 (6.9%) in 2019 primarily due to lower volume of Ecopass 2020 contracts processed and reduction of
construction contract retention.
Noncurrent liabilities and deferred inflows increased $89,812 (2.1%) in 2019 primarily due to change in the Net Pension Liability recognition
of deferred resources as require by GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and GASB Statement 71,
Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date.
The net position of RTD decreased by $126,628 (3.7%) during the current year compared to an increase of $49,997 (1.5%) in the previous
year. The decrease for 2019 was due to additional depreciation on assets that were placed in service during 2018 and 2019 due to the
opening of additional rail lines as well as expensing interest costs on the Eagle P3 project that had previously been recorded as prepaid
items. The 2018 increase was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax collections increases a one-time gain recognized for a
bond refunding, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses.

increased $1,659 (113.2%) in 2019 compared to a decrease of $1,516 (50.9%) in 2018. The increase in cost for 2019 was due to
retirement of capital assets resulting in a loss. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to no issuance costs in 2018 compared to 2017
issuance costs for 2017A/2017B Sales Tax FasTracks Revenue Bonds.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and improvements; leasehold improvements;

decrease in capital assets in 2019 was $9,362 (0.1%) compared to an increase of $47,169 (0.7%) in 2018. RTD acquires its assets with
sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants, and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and certificates of
participation. The decrease in 2019 was due primarily retirement of capital assets, primarily revenue earning equipment and additional
depreciation of assets placed in service with new rail line openings. The increase 2018 was primarily due to the cost of planning, design
and construction of FasTracks projects and fleet acquisition.

Major capital asset events during the 2019 fiscal year included the following:
FasTracks North Metro Corridor - The North Metro Corridor is an 18-mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and 162nd
Avenue, passing through Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and unincorporated Adams County. A construction contract was
entered to complete the commuter rail line from DUS north to 124th Avenue by 2019 with an option to extend construction to 162nd Avenue
if additional funding is identified.
East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private
partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program.
The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000 project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line Corridors as well
as the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was $305,000 below internal estimates. The project was fully in
revenue service in 2019.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and design
work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. The Eagle P3 Project elements are
described below:
FasTracks East Corridor - The East Corridor is a 23.6-mile commuter rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and Denver
International Airport. The East Corridor opened for revenue service in April 2016.

FasTracks Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility - The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility is designed to service the four planned
commuter rail corridors (East Corridor, Gold Line, North Metro, and Northwest Rail) included in the FasTracks plan. The Facility opened
in 2015.

FasTracks Northwest Electrified Rail Segment – The Northwest Rail Corridor, described previously, includes a project segment,
referred to as the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment, extending from Denver Union Station to Westminster. This segment opened for
revenue service in Summer 2016.
FasTracks I-225 Rail Line – The I-225 Rail Line is a 10.5-mile extension of RTD’s existing light rail line from the Southeast Line Nine Mile
Station to the East Line commuter rail transfer point near the intersection of Peoria Street and Smith Road. The project includes eight
stations and serves the Aurora City Center and the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. This line opened for revenue service in February
2017.
FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension – The Southeast Rail Extension extends the popular Southeast Rail Line from Lincoln Station to the
new RidgeGate Parkway Interchange at I-25. The project will add 2.3 miles of light rail. New stations will be built at Sky Ridge Medical
Center, Lone Tree City Center and RidgeGate with a 1,300 space Park-n-Ride facility. In 2018, expenditures related to the Southeast Rail
Extension were $32,848. The project opened for revenue service in 2019.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2020 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 61.3% and 64.8% of the
total revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect
the level of funding available to RTD during its fiscal year.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services provided. Passenger fares accounted for 14.4% and 14.6% of total
revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Passenger fare collections may be affected by fare levels charged by RTD.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations and capital expenditures.
Grants and local contributions provided 19.6% and 17.1% of total revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Grant funding and local
capital contributions are only available for use by RTD for qualifying expenditures after appropriation is made by the awarding agency.
Each year, RTD proposes an Amended Budget at mid-year to the Board of Directors for appropriation in order to adjust revenue and
expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing economic conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present
budget amendments to the Board of Directors for approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.
In July 2019, the Board of Directors approved the 2019 Amended Budget in which the primary changes driven by economic factors were
lower than anticipated sales and use tax collections and certain contractual increases in labor costs due to the tight labor market.
RTD is in various phases of construction and testing on the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), the North Metro rail line. This FasTracks
project is expected to open for revenue service during the next few years. Additional funding for other capital projects within the
FasTracks project scope have been deferred due to a lack of funding.

Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc.
(Authority), a nonprofit corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being used to
acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment acquired with the proceeds from the Certificates
under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its own
debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,089,312 and $1,137,932 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Certificates
outstanding decreased $48,620 (4.3%) in 2018 compared to a decrease of $38,465 (3.3%) in 2018. The decrease in 2019 and 2018 is
due to principal payment reducing debt.

2.11.B.a

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency, a political subdivision of
the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9,
C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the benefit of
the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield
and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each board member is elected to
serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in which the board member resides. As required by Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit. The
component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance of its
operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to
competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the
Bill was amended requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill
was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private transit companies. In May
of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is
provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD
for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves
as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncements 14 and 61 issued
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units
in the primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations
of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted for on the flow of economic
resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues
and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and
producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal
operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating expenses include the cost of services,
administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as
non-operating revenues and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted
resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they
are needed.

2.11.B.a

4. Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost or amortized cost which
approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more than one year from the date of purchase are carried
at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of operations. Materials and supplies
are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items.
Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows
are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management
provides for probable uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on
its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has
used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts
receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to current period operating expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property
and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gains
or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale of property and
equipment, which were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the date of the borrowing until
completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally
restricted) interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings on issuance
proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average construction expenditures
multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding obligations.

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the accompanying financial
statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately $417,209 and $378,780 at December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred outflow
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of
net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of resources
(expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net
position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that
time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other qualifying absences. The
number of days compensated in the various categories of absence is based generally on length of service. Compensated
absences, which have been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD.
In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are
recognized as they are incurred.

15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is collected from the farebox.
Sale of MyRide stored value, Mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ten/six ride and day pass tickets are recorded
as income at the time of sale. Sales of college based passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are
recorded initially as unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount
recognized in each month determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered. Sales
of Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated
evenly over the number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable sales made
within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the District. As described in Note E, under
the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A,
2017B and 2019A bond resolutions, and TIFIA Sales Tax, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt
service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and are remitted to a
trustee who satisfies debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond resolutions, and remits the balance
to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the merchant. Sales and Use Tax Bonds
debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax revenues in the amount of approximately $3,704,464
through 2050. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $104,377.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state
governments issue grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $116,303 and $52,229 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating
assistance grant revenue was $86,263 and $86,403 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other contribution revenue was
$8,194 and $28,773 in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP
establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides a
reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local governmental units. The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are
based upon management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and assumptions about future
events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions
to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by

the plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and
payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.

Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In 1992, Colorado voters
approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) Amendment in
which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of government revenues. The Amendment also requires
that an Emergency Reserve, referred to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service
be maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies.

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under this act, all uninsured
public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal
Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall
prescribe by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held in its
own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly identified as being security
maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public
depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or pledged and is
at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $5,861 and $33,514 collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a
specific issue or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the portfolio should, however, be flexible, depending
upon the outlook for the economy and the securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted investments. As of December 31,
2019, RTD was in compliance with these limits. As of December 31, 2018, RTD was in compliance with limitations set

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency obligations below the highest rating category, but no
lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements
of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1
(m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any
more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal documentation governing the
transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum
exposure limits listed above.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, RTD had $238,604 and $307,779 of cash and investments that were restricted under the
provisions of bond agreements.
Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement
and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is enhance comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets
and liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures
to provide comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a
government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the District has the ability to
access at the measurement date. Examples derived from NYSE, NASDAQ, Chicage Board of Trade, Pink Sheets.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
on the measurement date. Examples include Matrix pricing, market corroborated pricing; inputs such as yield curves and
indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on the reporting entity's reasonably
available information concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including

RTD maintains two single-employer defined benefit pension plans and one defined contribution plan for substantially all fulltime employees:

2.11.B.a

ATU 1001 Pension Plan – Defined Benefit (2019)
Plan Description

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected by the participant and the
spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the Plan are paid to participants who have attained age 65 and have been with the Plan for
ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.
Early retirement, effective January 1, 1992, any Participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited service and
terminated employment prior to attaining age 50, will be entitled to an early retirement benefit starting on the first day of any
month after he has attained age 50. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2011. The years of credited service needed
to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal
and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee, who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire, should die, his beneficiary
will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2,000
will be paid in a lump sum to the pensioners designated beneficiary.
Disability benefits, an individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment with RTD
as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit provided he or she has worked for at
least ten years for RTD in covered employment or any of its predecessors. An individual will be considered totally disabled
upon receipt of a disability award from Social Security. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to
qualify for a disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Deferred Vested Retirement Benefit, an individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason
other than retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he or she had worked for at least ten
years in covered employment for RTD or any of its predecessors. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested benefits as early
as age 50 if he or she has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and terminates active employment on or after
attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be
payable at any time after age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Benefit structure for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011. The following changes are included:
•

•
•

The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented
employees in accordance with the union agreement. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by
Compusys, Inc.

2.11.B.a

A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure when certain Plan funding
benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) is less than 11% of payroll, pension benefits would
be restored in the order of priority listed above. The "Trigger" remains in effect until such time as the 11% ARC is restored.

is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s projected fiduciary

ATU 1001 Pension Plan – Defined Benefit (2018)
Plan Description

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected by the participant and the
spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the Plan are paid to participants who have attained age 65 and have been with the Plan for
ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.
Early retirement, effective January 1, 1992, any Participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited service and
terminated employment prior to attaining age 50, will be entitled to an early retirement benefit starting on the first day of any
month after he has attained age 50. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2011. The years of credited service needed
to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal
and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee, who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire, should die, his beneficiary
will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2,000
will be paid in a lump sum to the pensioners designated beneficiary.
Disability benefits, an individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment with RTD
as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit provided he or she has worked for at
least ten years for RTD in covered employment or any of its predecessors. An individual will be considered totally disabled
upon receipt of a disability award from Social Security. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to
qualify for a disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Deferred Vested Retirement Benefit, an individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason
other than retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he or she had worked for at least ten
years in covered employment for RTD or any of its predecessors. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested benefits as early
as age 50 if he or she has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and terminates active employment on or after
attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be
payable at any time after age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Benefit structure for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011. The following changes are included:
•
•
•
•
•

The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1% with a new benefit schedule. (Priority 1).

The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented
employees in accordance with the union agreement. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by
Compusys, Inc.

2.11.B.a

• The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).
A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure when certain Plan funding
benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) is less than 11% of payroll, pension benefits would
be restored in the order of priority listed above. The "Trigger" remains in effect until such time as the 11% ARC is restored.

Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position
is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s projected fiduciary
net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).

above but determined as if the participant was married and the spouse was the same age as the participant.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service; monthly benefit if not eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or if elected within six months, a lump sum equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits,
payable in lieu of all other benefits in the Plan. Employee monthly benefit if eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2019, using the following actuarial
assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2018 for
disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2019:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

2.75%
3.70% - 6.45%, based on age
7.00%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense
and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate
of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage including expected
inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the pension plan’s target asset
allocation as of the December 31, 2018 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2019) are
summarized in the following data and reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon
which the disclosure is based:

RP-2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for healthy annuitants, blended 70% male / 30% female for participants and 30% male /
70% female for beneficiaries.
The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2017 evaluation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following present the net pension liability of the Plan, calculated using the discount rate of 7.00%, as well as
what the Plan’s net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point
lower (6.00%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.00%) than the current rate:

27,188
84.15%

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2017, using the following actuarial
assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2017 for
disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

3.00%
4.75% - 9.75%, based on age
7.50%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense
and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate
of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage including expected
inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the pension plan’s target asset
allocation as of the December 31, 2017 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018) are
summarized in the following data and reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon
which the disclosure is based:

The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2017 evaluation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following present the net pension liability of the Plan, calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as
what the Plan’s net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point
lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

RTD Plan – Defined Contribution
Plan Description

Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective
July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 (ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by
the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter. In addition
to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust
benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there continues
to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability) for represented employees
of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more
per quarter. The Trust is funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan contributions is
set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was $20,890 and $19,797 the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each
employee and funds the Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of its
health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited financial statements, which include
financial information for the plan. The financial statements may be obtained from the plan: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare
Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to
future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement,
death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid time off (PTO), vacation, and
sick leave based on time in service; employees are not allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation
accrual and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon
leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle of conservatism by
assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay in the near-term.

The RTD defined contribution plan represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted
amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008. RTD contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions totaled
$4,818 and $4,246 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the Plan. Membership was 709 and

NOTE G – OPERATING LEASES – LESSOR

In December 2012, RTD entered a contract with Union Station Alliance (USA) to renovate and lease RTD’s historic Denver
Union Station Building. The renovation by USA included a hotel, Amtrak facilities, office space, retail and restaurant services
as well as renovation of the Great Train Hall. The renovations were complete and open to the public in July 2014. The
agreement includes a 60-year lease to USA to operate and maintain the facility in which RTD will participate in certain revenue
collections.

2.11.B.a

Operating Lease – Purchased Transportation

The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD under the transactions and are
therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2019, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and the purchase of buses and
light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $115,716 and
$254,961 in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements of these grants. At
December 31, 2019, RTD had a commitment to provide $116,534 in matching funds in order to receive $33,443 in future
federal and state grant funds.
Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of routes, not to exceed
58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January 2019, 54.1% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by
private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to provide paratransit service to
the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses, operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed route
service. This service, called Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request) transportation
system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Passengers eligible for
Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed route. Since September
1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requirement to provide paratransit
service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate several of the transit improvements
contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor, the Gold
Line Rail Corridor and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3 Project). The Eagle P3
Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that was
selected through a competitive proposal process. The selected concessionaire is known as Denver Transit Partners (DTP), a
special purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016 and Phase II completed in
2019. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011
through 2017 for completed project elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the
B Line in 2016 and began services on the G Line in 2019 Under the terms of the concessionaire agreement, RTD will make
scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017 through 2044 in addition to service payments for the

RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been leased to and subleased
back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been
leased to and subleased back. As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received
from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party trustee.

provision of operations and maintenance services by DTP. The principal and interest payments are fixed amounts for the term
of the agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to certain inflation measurements. In addition,
the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes, special services and certain availability factors.

In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct the Southeast Rail Extension
Project. The Southeast Rail Extension includes 2.3 miles extending of the existing Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station
through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway Station featuring a new Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking
spaces. The Southeast Rail Extension opened in 2019.

In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail Line. The North Metro Rail
Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and
Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The North Metro Rail Line is expected to open within the
next few years.

2.11.B.a

Diesel Fuel Contract
RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Co of Gainesville, Inc. for diesel fuel. The contract is structured as a single year contract.
The estimated (no locked-in price) commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2020 is $18,000. RTD estimates usage of 9.0
million gallons at unit cost of $2.00 per gallon: 5.0 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 4.0 million gallons of RTD private
carrier’s usage.

Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to audit by FTA. Although the
outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an
extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a
loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit
option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under the provisions of the Colorado
Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving
personal injury and property damage is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $2,000. The amount
of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk
Management determines incurred claims by investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on
the day of assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and based
on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement of net assets. Changes in the
balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the budget also includes proceeds
of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal payments, and
excludes TABOR rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and losses on
disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration,
development, debt service, and capital outlays for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager submits to the
Board of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following January 1, which is
made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an
appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence
of such adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation.
RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve certain transfers within the budget.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA

2.11.B.a

In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State Constitution (Article X, Section 20)
that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights
(TABOR). The limits on property taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation
and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment excludes spending from certain
revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts, property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves
(balances). The amendment requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year
debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve retention of
these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending be established for declared
emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further
exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt
incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD
from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program. At the time
that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid transit
system financed through FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’ limitations. This
debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid transit improvement program. Based
on estimated fiscal year spending for 2019, $25,940 of year-end net position has been reserved for emergencies. The
Amendment is complex and subject to judicial interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements of the
Amendment based on the interpretations of the Amendment’s language available at year-end.
NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The virus
subsequently spread globally resulting in a worldwide pandemic which is expected to cause significant disruptions to the
economy. Several measures have been implemented by governments in the District including directives for social distancing
and stay-at-home orders to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These measures have severely curtailed activity within the
District with RTD experiencing an approximate 70% reduction in ridership that began in mid-March 2020. In response, RTD
undertook several initiatives including safety precautions for its employees and evaluating service levels, costs and impacts to
revenue. On March 26, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES) was signed into law in which
grant funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of $232 million will be made available to RTD to fund operations
during the pandemic. On April 5, 2020, RTD suspended the collection of fares in accordance with social distancing measures
and on April 19, 2020 RTD reduced its transit services by approximately 40% to reduce costs and adjust services to the lower
demand. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts RTD’s operations and financial condition will depend on future developments,
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak.

Regional Transportation District
We have audited the basic financial statements of RTD for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our
audit was performed in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing
Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit
involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. We also assessed the accounting principles used by RTD and the reasonableness
of significant estimates made by RTD’s management, as well as evaluated the overall financial
statement presentation.
Auditing standards require the auditor to ensure that those charged with governance receive
additional information regarding the scope and results of the audit that may assist the governing body
in overseeing the financial reporting and disclosure process for which management is responsible. The
following section describes matters which are required to be reported to you.

Our Responsibility Under U.S. Generally Accepted
Auditing Standards, Government Auditing Standards And
The Uniform Guidance
Our responsibility, as described by professional standards,
is to express an opinion about whether the financial
statements prepared by management with your
assistance are fairly presented, in all material respects, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and whether RTD complied in all material
respects with the applicable compliance requirements of
its major federal programs. Our audit of the financial
statements and compliance does not relieve you or
management of responsibility for the accuracy of the
financial statements and/or compliance with applicable
requirements.
Professional standards also require that we obtain a
significant understanding of RTD’s internal control to plan
the audit. However, such understanding is required for the
purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to
provide any assurance concerning such internal control.
Accordingly, we express no such assurance.

Management Judgments And
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the financial
statements requires the use of
accounting estimates. Certain
estimates are particularly sensitive
due to their significance to the
financial statements and the
possibility that future events may
differ significantly from
management’s expectations.
Financial Statement Disclosures

COMMENTS
We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates
in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the financial statements
taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial
statements are:


Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon estimated useful
lives of capital assets.



Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts is based on
management’s review of outstanding receivables.



Management’s estimate of the net pension liabilities and related amounts
are based on actuarial valuations and employee census data.

The disclosures are neutral, consistent and clear. Certain disclosures are
particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users.
The most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements are:


The disclosure of deposits and investments in Note B



The disclosure of capital assets in Note D



The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E



The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned compensation plans
in Note F



The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in Note H



The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations in Note K

Committee meeting on April 7, 2020.
In 2007, in anticipation of the construction of the G Line, the City of Arvada released the Arvada Transit
Station Framework Plan, highlighting Olde Town Arvada Station as the most prominent station along the
G Line. The plan foresaw the “character of the Olde Town Station area [as] a vibrant urban village that
preserves its historic fabric and also allows new opportunities for living, employment, shopping, dining,
and cultural experiences.” In order to move that vision forward, the City of Arvada and the Arvada
Urban Renewal Authority (AURA) sought RTD’s support in aligning RTD’s G Line corridor planning with
local goals. Specifically, Arvada suggested that, rather than expand the existing RTD surface parking lot,
RTD work with the City and private partners to accommodate bus and rail parking in a garage; this
strategy would open up land for development adjacent to the Station.
In 2014, RTD, the City, and AURA released a Request for Proposals for the development of a 9-acre site
southeast of the Station, which included an existing RTD Park-n-Ride. The group’s intent was for the
privately developed project to include a mix of uses that would complement and enhance the existing
character of Olde Town. Trammell Crow was selected as the developer, and planning and design began
on what has become the Olde Town Transit Hub. The Hub is owned by Arvada and includes an RTD bus
transit facility on the ground floor and 600 parking spaces on the floors above. The Hub was funded by
Arvada/AURA, RTD, and a CDOT Faster Grant. Arvada contributed more than $24 million, the Faster
Grant totaled $1.5 million, and RTD allocated the $7 million it would have spent on a new surface lot, as
well as $3.4 million in land value. RTD’s contribution included FTA funds from the New Starts grant for
the Eagle project and federal funds that were used in the original purchase of the surface parking lot.

2.12.C

The Hub opened in fall 2016 and began serving RTD rail patrons in the spring of 2019 with the opening
of the G Line. Bus operations moved into the ground-floor facility in August 2019.
When the Hub opened to RTD patrons, Arvada granted RTD a Permanent and Nonexclusive Easement to
the bus facility and 400 spaces in the garage; the remaining 200 spaces are reserved for Olde Town
employees and visitors. The parties also agreed to an Operation and Maintenance Intergovernmental
Agreement, which makes Arvada responsible for the upkeep of the garage, with an annual $44,000
payment from RTD to Arvada to cover some of the costs. In 2019, the cost to manage and maintain the
Hub was approximately $415,000. Lastly, Arvada and RTD committed to a Memorandum of
Understanding (the “MOU”) that established an 18-month, Preliminary Parking Management Plan to
regulate parking in the Hub. Under the MOU, the Hub’s parking spaces are segregated pursuant to the
easement and Arvada is not permitted to charge parking fees. Arvada and RTD agreed to use the 18
months of the MOU to gather and analyze parking data and develop a permanent parking plan that
would be formalized in the IGA that is now under consideration.
Arvada contracted with Walker Consultants to complete a parking study in the Hub and recommend
parking-management strategies based on industry best practices. Based on data collected by manual
counts in the Hub, Walker determined that the average peak utilization on weekdays from August to
December 2019 was approximately 63%. RTD’s spaces were far more highly utilized on weekdays than
Arvada’s, 85% and 17% respectively. On weekends, overall utilization was lower, at only 20%, or 23%
of RTD’s spaces and 13% of Arvada’s. Walker cross-checked the manual data with users’ selfidentification via a cellphone app and kiosks, as well as with bus and rail ridership. The consultants
determined that, although it was not possible to verify that all the users parking in RTD spaces were in
fact using RTD, users were generally following the Hub’s rules and generating accurate data.
Given that weekday peak utilization stood at approximately 63% at the end of 2019 and was dominated
by RTD patrons, Arvada and RTD, with input from Walker Consultants, have tentatively agreed that if
utilization reaches 85% Arvada has the right to charge all users parking fees in order to manage parking
demand. In other words, Arvada will use parking charges to ensure that there are always some open
spaces in the garage. In exchange, parking will no longer be segregated under the easement, giving RTD
patrons access to more parking spaces within the garage. However, the easement will remain in place to
protect the interests of RTD and the FTA in the Hub.
COVID-19 has caused precipitous declines in utilization at the Hub as ridership has dropped and Olde
Town businesses have temporarily closed. At the beginning of 2020, it seemed possible that utilization
at the garage would reach 85% and Arvada would be able to start charging soon; now, it seems more
likely that it will be years before the combined use generated by RTD ridership and Olde Town
employees and businesses will hit the 85% milestone.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to negotiate and
execute the IGA with Arvada to govern parking management at the Hub. RTD’s execution of the IGA
will only be authorized to take place if the following conditions are met:
1. There will be no segregation of parking spaces in the Hub between the 400 spaces for which
RTD holds an easement and Arvada’s 200 spaces. As such, RTD customers will have
unimpeded access to all 600 spaces, including at peak times.
2. Arvada will use all revenue generated at the Hub for the management and maintenance of the
Hub or, alternatively, transit-supportive uses approved by RTD.

Packet Pg. 148

2.12.C

3. All customers will be required to self-identify as RTD or Arvada users by cellphone app or at a
kiosk in the Hub.
4. Arvada will report utilization rates and customers’ self-identified user type to RTD on a
monthly basis. Additionally, RTD may perform its own audits and will have access to Arvada’s
records related to the Hub.
5. Arvada will be permitted to charge all users to park in the Hub if the average weekday peak
utilization rate reaches or exceeds 85%. Arvada will be permitted to charge each vehicle up to
$2/day for the stabilization period.
6. At the end of the stabilization period, and at regular intervals thereafter, Arvada will analyze
utilization rates and notify RTD if Arvada intends to raise or lower the parking rate:
a. If the average weekday peak utilization rate reaches or exceeds 85%, Arvada may raise
the fee in 50-cent increments to manage parking demand.
b. If the average weekday peak utilization rate falls below 55%, Arvada will decrease the
fee in 50-cent increments to promote utilization.
7. The maximum daily fee allowed under this IGA will be $5.
8. For special events after 5pm on weekdays, or on weekends and holidays, Arvada may
designate special rates in order to manage parking availability. RTD users will be exempt from
special rates.
9. Overnight, multi-day parking up to 30 days will be allowed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Accepting the Recommended Action would have no impact on RTD’s ongoing opera tions and
maintenance costs for the Hub, which are governed by a separate agreement.

This recommendation action supports the following GM Goals.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
Each year in the June/July timeframe the Board adopts an amended budget. The purpose of the
amended budget is to account for any adjustments in revenue projections and/or expenditures from the
budget that was adopted the previous November/December.
DISCUSSION
The 2020 budget was adopted by the Board in December 2019. In March of 2020, RTD funding and
operations were severely impacted by COVID-19. COVID-19 has required larger adjustments to both
revenues and expenditures that are normally seen during the amended budget process. We have
presented three (3) revenue scenarios to the Board: a best case, worst case, and middle of the road.
We have determined at this time that the best case most likely will not occur.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
As a result of these changes, there will be an estimated positive balance at the end of 2020 of
$25,071,000. Revenues are estimated to increase by $3,921,000 and expenditures are estimated to
decrease by a net $6,300,000 (Exhibit A and Exhibit C). $7,425,000 in payroll savings will be taken, as
well as an additional $7,425,000 in either payroll or other cost reductions.
As actual revenue is realized, we will update the Board. We may need to make additional adjustments
to revenues and expenditures in the coming months.

Award of “Group 30” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First Transit for the
provision of contracted “Group 30” fixed-route transit services. This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$50,694,345; the option year 1 amount is $18,203,287; and the option year 2 amount is
$18,886,381. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $87,784,013. In addition, RTD
will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $4,882,393 for the
initial 3-year contract term; $1,710,599 for option year 1; and $1,745,170 for option year 2. The
total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is $8,338,162. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for
the contracted fixed route transit service and fuel is $96,122,176.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On January 27, 2020, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-001 named “Group 30” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 30” service package
replaces “Group 26”, which will expire in 2021. The service package consists of 74 buses operating 18
routes providing approximately 191,311 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in
“Group 30” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals were due on April 3,
2020. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for providing fixed-route service,
including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and conforming to

Packet Pg. 157

2.12.E

RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a fixed-price basis
and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.
DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to
Request for Proposals (RFP) 120-FH-001 to provide “Group 30” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 10, 2021.
PROCUREMENT:
Three (3) proposals were received from First Transit, Transdev and National Express Transit in response
to RFP 120-FH-001 for the Provision of “Group 30” Public Transportation Services. All proposals were
evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE
plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and safety record. The technical
evaluation team consisted of Greg Smith, Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations; Erin
Vallejos, Manager, Competitive Services; Dave Ober, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance;
Corey Inman, Assistant Manager, Bus Operator Training; Niconor Garcia, Technician, Contracted
Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Alexis Serrano Castro, Manager, Small
Business Office and Jose Chirinos, Compliance Officer, SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored by the Procurement Department staff.
“GROUP 30” PROPOSALS:
First Transit - The following is a summary of the strong points of the First Transit “Group 30” proposal
which support the recommendation of contract award to First Transit:
Facility. Located at 811 South Sherman St, Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501, this facility is centrally
located within the “Group 30” service area. The facility is fully functional and its location does not
require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times to get to bus route terminals. In
addition to this facility being fully functional, many improvements will be implemented to expand inhouse training and maintenance capability, enhance security and lot functionality, and to meet ADA
accessibility requirements for the building. There will be no disruption of service or added start-up
costs when transitioning from the previous “Group 26” service to the new “Group 30” contract.
Bus Operator Wages. First Transit’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage will increase from $19.19/hour to $19.91/hour (RTD starting wage for
operators will be $20.58/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels.
RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining
qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide First Transit the opportunity to offer a
more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators and result in
improved service for our passengers.

Packet Pg. 158

2.12.E

Mechanic Wages. First Transit’s proposal provides an increase in mechanic wages. The First Transit C
level mechanic wage will increase from $22.26/hour to $23.15/hour (RTD starting wage for an entry
level mechanic will be $26.08/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other mechanic wage levels.
The proposed wage increases will provide First Transit the opportunity to offer a more attractive wage
package which will improve recruitment and retention of mechanics.
Dedicated First Transit Recruiter. This full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of bus
operators and maintenance personnel for the First Transit locations.
Enhanced Quality Control. First Transit will track all performance metrics captured through FirstBase,
GeoTab, and DriveCam, along with on-the-road coaching through street supervision staff, to monitor,
maintain and, if necessary, improve performance under all RTD Board of Director adopted performance
measures.
Maintenance Program. First Transit will implement Geotab technology on all buses, enabling effective
predictive analysis of the fleet to identify and eliminate repetitive repairs. Customized training programs
are developed for each technician by Cengage Learning through comprehensive online skills
assessments. During the term of the “Group 30” contract First Transit has committed to obtaining an
Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) shop certification and the shop is currently Silver LEAN certified.
First Transit has also committed to completing many outstanding Component Change Outs by the end of
June 2020.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit division consistently
meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with surrounding governments and communities. The team has
long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 26” contract to the new “Group 30” contract.

and Puerto Rico. The local operation is supported by a number of experienced professionals at the
Regional level.
SBE goal set at 5%. First Transit’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by First Transit.
Transdev - The following is a summary of the Transdev “Group 30” proposal that does not support the
recommendation of contract award to Transdev:
Facility. Located at 811 South Sherman St, Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501, this facility is centrally
located within the “Group 30” service area. The facility is fully functional and its location does not
require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times to get to bus route terminals; however,
a detailed plan on how Transdev would be fully operational within the facility on the service start date
was not provided.
Start-up. Transdev proposed a start-up facility located at 21 South Sunset Street, Longmont, CO
80501 but did not provide a comprehensive explanation of when the facility is available, any
modifications or changes that need to be made, capacity for training operators and other staff, capacity
for storing buses and other required vehicles or location for maintenance of training buses.
Management Team. The proposed Transdev local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 30” RFP.
Cost. Transdev’s proposed price has an additional $5,127,735 in costs, this included $3,200,407 in
additional management fees.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were not all
adequately addressed by Transdev. For this reason and the others noted above, the technical evaluation
team determined that it was not in the best interest of RTD to pursue any further action with the
Transdev “Group 30” proposal.
National Express - The following is a summary of the National Express “Group 30” proposal that does
not support the recommendation of contract award to National Express:
Facility. Located at 811 South Sherman St, Unit D, Longmont, CO 80501, this facility is centrally
located within the “Group 30” service area. The facility is fully functional and its location does not
require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times to get to bus route terminals; however,
a detailed plan on how National Express would be fully operational within the facility on the service start
date was not provided.

Packet Pg. 160

2.12.E

Start-up. No facility was proposed for the necessary start-up and transition activities nor was a detailed
timeline provided.
Management Team. The proposed National Express local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 30” RFP.
Cost. National Express’ proposed price has an additional $14,667,251 in costs, this included
$3,348,477 in additional management fees.
For the reasons noted above, the technical evaluation team determined that it was not in the best
interest of RTD to pursue any further action with the National Express “Group 30” proposal.
First Transit “GROUP 26” PERFORMANCE:
The First Transit division currently operates the “Group 26” fixed route service package. The division’s
performance was evaluated based on the following Board of Directors adopted performance measures:

Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: First Transit utilizes bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasize safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their
facilities.

Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: First Transit raises awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles. Both
of the passenger accidents that occurred in 2019 were classified as non-preventable.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: First Transit places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: First Transit understands the impact new operators, construction detours, and
traffic can have on OTP. Over the course of operating this service package, First Transit worked in
conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They identified low performing
routes and assigned street supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with operators to discuss
factors that impact their ability to run on time. Schedule issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning
and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: First Transit did not meet the goal in 2019 or the 1st quarter of
2020. First Transit Longmont did however meet the goal for Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance
Road Calls with approximately 37,000 miles in both April and May 2020. In addition to continuing to
address deficiencies identified in First Transit Longmont’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and
Quality Control (QC) practices, an expanded maintenance action plan was implemented during the 1st
quarter to further address all issues. First Transit has since improved Preventive Maintenance Inspection
adherence to 100%, reduced repeat maintenance occurrences by 29% and reduced overdue Component
Change Outs by 72%.
Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations and work closely with local
and corporate management teams to ensure this goal is being addressed by completing preventive
maintenance inspections on-time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues,
providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses in
their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: First Transit continues to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to reduce the number of customer complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 30” service package to a contract operator. Due to
continued labor challenges, RTD anticipated proposers would implement a competitive wage
structure that was in line with the local labor market as well as an increase for inflation.
Additionally, RTD factored in increases in maintenance costs associated with the aging fleet and
additional parts and support equipment for the diesel exhaust fluid after treatment systems required
on replacement buses during the term of the contract. RTD Competitive Services total five-year
estimate for the “Group 30” service package was $89,318,914.
First Transit’s proposed total five-year price was $87,784,013. First Transit’s price proposal
included increases in inflation, CBA agreed upon Operator and Mechanic wage increases to address
differences between RTD and First Transit wages, and maintenance costs associated with the aging

Transdev’s proposed five-year price was $92,911,748.
Transdev’s price proposal included
significantly higher costs associated with maintenance and management fees. RTD requested that
Transdev provide a Best and Final Offer and they declined to reconsider their proposal. Transdev’s
price proposal was not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than
RTD would expect to pay for the “Group 30” service package.
National Express’s proposed five-year price was $102,451,264. National Express’s price proposal
included significantly higher costs associated with supervisory, staff and operator wages, general
overhead and management fees. National Express’s price proposal was not considered further since
their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD would expect to pay for the “Group 30”
service package.

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the “Group 30” service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $94,665,856, which is $6,881,843 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by First Transit. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected
wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixedroute services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the
“Group 30” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and
maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the

provision of the services.
The First Transit total five-year proposed price represents a $6,881,843 (7%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 30” - Proposer Service Cost
