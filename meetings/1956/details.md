#### 1. Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Update (Leeds School of Business/Howerter)

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, introduced Robert McNown and Brian Lewandowski from the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business (CU Leeds).  He said that they would provide the Board with an update and then answer any questions.

Robert McNown thanked the Board for the opportunity to present this evening.  He also recognized Richard Wobbekind and Miles Light as members of the team who were unable to attend the meeting.  Robert McNown also recognized and thanked the RTD staff for their prompt data and reviews of CU Leeds reports.  He reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the September 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Robert McNown stressed that there is a lot of uncertainty involved in forecasting.  He shared that the short-term and medium-term forecasts are affected by employment, personal income, and retail sales and taxable sales; the long-term forecasts focus on changes in population and age distribution which affect savings, labor supply, productivity, output, and household expenditures.  He noted that the Denver and Boulder metro areas have recovered much more quickly than the national U.S. economy when looking at employment and personal income growth.

Robert McNown explained that while there is always uncertainty in CU Leeds forecasts, they make frequent revisions to reflect new information as it becomes available.  He said that although the uncertainty does mean that the CU Leeds forecasts will have errors, there are not persistent biases in the forecasts that are predominately positive or negative.  Robert McNown shared that overall the CU Leeds team is happy with the magnitudes of the forecast errors.  He pointed out that several complications in the Sales and Use Tax forecasts have come from lower forecasts of key economic drivers at the national level while at the same time having stronger forecasts for Colorado, the change in the tax base since RTD now has tax parity with the State, and marijuana retail sales tax.

Robert McNown stated that the projected rate of revenue growth for the short and medium-term forecasts is very strong.  The economy is projected to be fully recovered by 2018 so growth rates will begin to be more modest at that time.  He said that the long-term forecast has rates of growth that are remarkably stable.  Robert McNown stressed that the integrity of the forecasts are very important.  These are insured through:

- Forecasts being updated quarterly to reflect the most current economic situation

- Forecasts being generated from theoretically sound economic relations, modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time series analysis

- CU Leeds forecasts not incorporating “add factors” or other subjective adjustments of model forecasts

- CU Leeds being independent from RTD with no political or financial stake in the forecast numbers

Director Bagley thanked Robert McNown for his report.  He said that he really appreciates the distinction made that CU Leeds has no political or financial stake in the forecasts, which is very important for RTD.  Director Bagley said that these forecasts are really a balancing act with the economic predictions so he understands the difficulty CU Leeds has with continually making changes.

Director Bagley stated that RTD is in a great position right now but the Board needs to understand that things will normalize in the future.  He reiterated that one of the greatest economic development tools for the Denver Metro region is FasTracks.  He believes that this will be a factor in future forecasts but it is hard to know to what extent.  Director Bagley also noted the fact that the Metro area is number one in attracting millennials and fourth in creating jobs.  He said this emphasizes that RTD is in a good position as long as we continue to manage assets appropriately.

Director Folska wondered if CU Leeds could consider adding a new variable for vehicle miles traveled into the forecasting.  She commented that the Oregon State Legislature is conducting a pilot Road Usage Charge Program.  She asked that CU Leeds look at forecasting a similar type program for the Denver Metro region so the Board could understand how that might impact RTD’s revenues.  Director Folska thinks that the states are often a testing ground for what the Nation as a whole will tolerate and this type of program could be a fix to the Highway Trust Fund issue.  Robert McNown said that his team would be happy to look into that.

Director Solano said that when he took statistics he realized it was a shot in the dark.  He believes that someone can make any variable appear the way that person wants it to.  Robert McNown said he respects Director Solano’s views; however, he believes that by showing how there is uncertainty involved, CU Leeds is trying to give an honest portrayal of the inherent errors in forecasting.

Chair Sisk thanked Robert McNown and the CU Leeds team for their forecasts.  He noted that RTD was criticized years ago for not having an independent forecast.  He appreciates the work that goes into these forecasts and does not take it lightly.  Chair Sisk inquired why Robert McNown did not review the forecasts that factored in HB1272[[1]](#_ftn1).  Terry Howerter explained that the projections for HB1272 were done by the State of Colorado Legislative Council; however, there is no way to find the Use Tax for manufacturing equipment in the Denver area.  He said that because of this RTD staff asked CU Leeds to remove that from the forecasting so we had a more accurate picture.

Committee Chair Walker noted the chart showing that the National household debt has declined for home mortgages.  He wonders if the trend might be different if Colorado were isolated.  He also wonders if CU Leeds can determine how much of the Sales and Use Tax growth in Colorado is due to the oil and gas industry.  Brian Lewandowski explained that they were unable to isolate either of those items.

Committee Chair Walker asked if CU Leeds thought immigration reform might affect the outlook of employment and personal income for Colorado.  Robert McNown said that was very hard to predict because of the ever changing political climate.

#### 2. Contract Extension for First Southwest Financial Advisors

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the second option year of the contract with First Southwest (FSC) for Financial Advisory Services, which will extend the performance period through December 31, 2015 and increase the total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000.  Funding for the 2015 option is included in the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.

Motion:               Director Anderson make the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 16, 2014 Board meeting.

Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter asked Susan Cohen, Manager of FasTracks Program Controls, to review this item with the Board.  Susan Cohen stated that First Southwest (FSC) has done some very good work for RTD.  FSC did a great deal of financial modeling in support of reports to DRCOG, FTA and TIFIA, and they played a crucial role in the I-225 and North Metro unsolicited proposals.  She explained that FSC plays an even more crucial role than RTD envisioned as the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed new rules requiring municipalities to retain a Municipal Advisor to have any conversations with investment banks; all FSC professionals that work with RTD are registered Municipal Advisors with the SEC.  She said this allows RTD to legally continue to work with a variety of investment banks to find creative and innovative methods to efficiently finance projects.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. Second Quarter 2014 Internal Audit Report

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated that the audits were available in the September 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He asked if there were any questions.

Director Menten noted the Cell Phone Stipends report indicated that there were employees receiving a stipend who did not have their phone number listed in the internal phone directory.  She asked how many employees out of the 367 receiving a stipend did not have their number listed.  Director Menten expressed concern that the average stipend was about $90 per month.  She thought that seemed high.  Kevin Parker, Senior Internal Auditor, explained that he only did a test sample; however, he found a high enough percentage that he felt the recommendation for inclusion in the internal phone directory to be part of the policy was warranted.  Kevin Parker said that because the stipend is included in an employee’s taxable income it gets increased by a fair amount, as is common with many organizations.

#### 4. 2015 Requested Budget (High Level Update)

Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reviewed a high level Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the September 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Director James inquired about the percentage of expense for our electrically powered equipment versus fuel.  He also asked if electricity is something RTD can negotiate the same way we do for diesel.  Jannette Scarpino said that traction power was budgeted at $7.2 million and gas and diesel was budgeted at $38 million for 2015.  Terry Howerter stated that RTD has the best rate available for electricity but that Director James was correct that it is not negotiable in the same way fuel is.

##### a. 2015 requested budget 090914

#### 5. Fiscal Sustainability Committee Recommendations Update

Jannette Scarpino stated that since the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations were made in 2011, the following have been completed:

- Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections

- Service Optimization

- Fund Balance Policy

- Sales and Use Tax Exemptions

- Technology and Energy Innovation

She said that the items currently being worked on are:

- Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews

- Naming Rights

- Partnerships and Privatization

Director Bagley stated that he is very pleased that RTD has taken these Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations seriously.  He believes the work of the Task Force was really critical and greatly benefits RTD.  He pointed out to the Directors that were not on the Board that the Task Force was comprised of many experts external to RTD.  Director Bagley said he also appreciates that we are able to work with former Director Barbara Brohl at the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR).

Director Menten asked when staff might have the results of some of the audits being conducted.  Terry Howerter stated that it is a very lengthy process.  Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, explained that our contractor, Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), must first identify vendors to submit to the DOR.  The vendors are approved by RTD to send to the DOR who then ultimately approve the audits.  He said that we initially submitted 113 vendors that were whittled down to 37 by the DOR.  After the DOR approves the vendors for audit, RRG will request various records from the vendors which can take quite a bit of time.  Doug MacLeod said that RRG will continue to identify vendors so we have a steady stream of audits.  He stated that he anticipates having some results over the next several months.

#### 6. Second Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

There were no questions on the Second Quarter Performance Measures.

##### a. 2014 performance measures-second quarter

#### 7. July 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod noted that ridership and fare revenue are falling slightly short of the budgeted increase of about 3%; however, he said that Sales and Use tax is up and overall our financial position is good.

Director Bagley expressed a concern that the fare revenue will be down significantly related to the budget by the end of the year.  He said that this is very important to factor in as RTD conducts its Fare Study/Task Force.  He reminded the other Directors that in 2011 there was a recommendation to cut $10 to $11 million in service.  He stated that he does not want RTD to be in a similar position again.
