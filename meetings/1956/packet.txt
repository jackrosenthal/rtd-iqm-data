BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: September 4, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

September 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Contract Extension
Financial Advisors

for

First

Southwest

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the second option year of the contract with
First Southwest (FSC) for Financial Advisory Services, which will extend the performance period through
December 31, 2015 and increase the total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000. Funding for
the 2015 option is included in the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense
budget for FasTracks.
BACKGROUND
In August 2010, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for financial advisory services. Six proposals were
received, and First Southwest was selected as the most qualified proposer. The contract was structured
as a three-year contract with two one-year options to be exercised at RTD’s discretion, at a price of
$120,000 per year. The original period of performance ended on December 31, 2013. RTD exercised
the first option to extend the performance period through December 31, 2014. The original contract
and the first option were awarded within the General Manager’s contract authority of $500,000.
Exercising the second option will increase the contract amount above the General Manager’s authority.
DISCUSSION
Over the first four years of this contract, FSC has performed extensive financial modeling and analysis
for the FasTracks program. FSC provided the financial modeling in support of awarding the contracts to
complete the I-225 Rail Line and the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue. FSC also supported the
delivery of the 2011, 2012, and 2014 Annual Program Evaluations, SB208 submittals to DRCOG in
2011 and 2012, Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendments in 2012 and 2013, and the 2014
Baseline Report approved by the Board at the July meeting. FSC also supported the annual financial
plan updates required by the terms of the TIFIA loan for the Eagle project. Through all of these projects,
FSC has provided RTD with high-quality, timely work product. FSC staff has been proactive and
responsive to RTD questions and concerns, and has helped RTD respond to comments from DRCOG,
TIFIA, and corridor stakeholders.
FSC also has played a significant role in RTD debt issuances and refundings over the same time period.
FSC brought forward the three debt refundings that were executed in early 2013 to provide the capacity
to extend the North Metro Rail Line to 72nd Avenue, and structured the COP issuance that allowed RTD
to extend the line to 124th Avenue. FSC also acted as financial advisor for the two sales tax bond
refundings in 2013, and structured the COPs issued by RTD in 2013 to give RTD the lowest cost of
capital through combining a refunding with a new issuance to fund buses and other capital equipment.
Under new rules imposed by the Securities Exchange Commission in 2014 and as required by the 2010
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, municipalities that wish to have open and
productive conversations with investment banks must now retain a Municipal Advisor who is a qualified
financial professional such as an investment banker or financial consultant who counsels municipalities

Packet Pg. 26

1.C.2

on financial transactions such as bond offerings. The Municipal Advisor must be registered with the
SEC and must have a fiduciary responsibility to the municipality. The FSC professionals that work with
RTD are registered Municipal Advisors with the SEC. This allows RTD to legally continue to work with a
variety investment banks to find creative and innovative methods to efficiently finance projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2015 contract amount of $120,000 is included in the FasTracks financial plan for 2015,
and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
authorize the second option year of the contract with First Southwest for Financial Advisory
Services, which will extend the performance period through December 31, 2015 and increase the
total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000. Funding for the 2015 option is included in
the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, issue a new Request for Proposals for financial
advisory services. This is not recommended because First Southwest has performed its work
well and has provided value to RTD in excess of its contract amount.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use in-house staff to perform all necessary
financial modeling and debt services. This is not recommended because of the new SEC
Municipal Advisor rule and would hinder RTD’s ability to communicate with investment banks and
to continue to find creative and innovative ways to efficiently finance projects.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 HORIZON COACH LINES
FUEL COSTS CONTRACT
AUDIT REPORT # 14-04-03

RTD has contracted with Horizon Coach Lines to supply Access-a-Ride services using
RTD vehicles. As part of this arrangement, Horizon maintains a storage tank on their
property for the unleaded fuel which is used in providing Access-a-Ride transportation.
RTD reimburses Horizon for direct fuel costs incurred in operating these RTD owned
buses.
During 2013, RTD reimbursed Horizon approximately $758,000 for fuel consumption by
the Access-a-Ride vehicles, which average between seven and eight miles per gallon.
Horizon supplies a monthly fuel invoice to RTD which includes weekly details of fuel
consumption for each bus, with the number of driven miles and calculated Miles per
Gallon included.
Each submitted fuel invoice is reviewed and approved for payment at RTD by
appropriate individuals who are involved with the Access-a-Ride contracts. Approved
documents are forwarded to Accounts Payable for check issuance.
AUDIT SCOPE
The review included the process by which Horizon monitors fuel used by RTD Accessa-Ride vehicles and bills RTD for those fuel costs. Internal Audit also reviewed the
controls over RTD processing and payment of Horizon fuel invoices during 2013.
CONCLUSION
Testing of paid invoices identified a December 2013 Horizon fuel charge that was in
error and resulted in an overpayment of $5,114. RTD management has since reviewed
all 2013 fuel invoices from Horizon and has met with Horizon to revise processes in an
effort to prevent any similar errors going forward. RTD management will also review
Horizon’s revised fuel processes after Horizon relocates to their new facility, later in
2014.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

1.D.3.a

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 CELL PHONE STIPENDS
AUDIT REPORT # 14-05-05

RTD developed Management Directive # IT-1 Cell Phones, dated May 2012. The
Directive was originally established to help address the issue of employees being
charged for work related calls and messages that were being sent and received on their
personal phones.
In accordance with IRS regulations, the stipends are considered taxable income, are
included as income on RTD employee paychecks, and are reported to appropriate
taxing authorities at year end. Per RTD Management, the stipends were structured to
include the cost of the phone or equipment charges and the tax impact for employees
receiving the stipend. The current total annual cost for RTD Cell Phone Stipends is
approximately $386,000 for 367 employees.
AUDIT SCOPE
The audit concentrated on the Cell Phone Stipend process including initial authorization,
tracking, and periodic reporting of stipends. Internal Audit did not review individual
employee’s personal cell phone records.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing verified that required approvals were on hand for employees who
are receiving Cell Phone Stipends. However, there is concern with the number and
related cost of employees currently receiving the stipends. As such, Internal Audit has
recommended that Management Directive # IT-1 be clarified to more clearly indicate
who qualifies for a Cell Phone Stipend. We have also suggested that all current
stipends be reviewed for propriety.
Internal Audit has also recommended that all employees receiving a stipend ensure
their cell phone number is included in RTD internal phone records so that they can be
reached when necessary, particularly if out of the office.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal

CHECK REQUEST
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-03-04

The Check Request Audit was suggested by Management. Check request procedures
were established to handle certain expenses routinely incurred without the issuance of
purchasing documentation. They should be used where there are no standard
contracts.
Check request authorizations are not authority for the purchase of new goods or
services but rather to make payment for previously budgeted and approved items or
payments of a constant or recurring nature.
During 2013 staff at RTD processed 8,274 check requests for a total of $471,983,805.
There were 3,674 check requests totaling $181,576,875, between January and May
2014.
SCOPE & OBJECTIVES
The audit period covered check requests from January 2013 to May 2014.
The objectives of the audit were to:
 Ensure policies and procedures are in place to control the use of check requests
and they are being applied as prescribed.
 Determine that the policies and procedures contain sufficient internal controls to
prevent fraud loss and misappropriation.
 Ensure that the processed check requests are authorized and approved as
required.
CONCLUSION
Internal Controls within the policies and procedures covering check requests could be
strengthened in the following areas.



Oracle procedures for handling check requests including authorization and
approval should be included.
Responsibility for reviewing check requests should be clearly defined.

Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

Fiscal
Sustainability
Recommendations Update

Committee

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently
approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation.
The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The status
of those Task Force recommendations is as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, some service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances, therefore,
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance

Packet Pg. 47

1.D.5

policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. This target was established based on levels recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further categorizes the
available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital Replacement Fund and
an Unrestricted Fund. At FYE 12/31/13, fund balances for the Base System totaled $45.2 million,
consisting of the Board Restricted Fund of $16.2 million, the Capital Replacement Fund of $9.0 million,
and the Unrestricted Fund of $20.0 million. Combined fund balances (including FasTracks) totaled
$62.7 million at the same date.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. Exemption parity was identified by the Task Force as providing a
benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes and
vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different
taxable items than the state. RTD introduced legislation that was passed in May 2013 to establish
parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity took effect
1/1/14. RTD estimates that parity will generate a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on 2012
figures, however, this will be difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems; however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. Based on this information, RTD has
budgeted for energy upgrades throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan, and we will continue
to address energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are completed. RTD received a
grant to install solar panels at East Metro and this project is completed. Facilities Maintenance has also
done lighting upgrades replacing older metal-halide fixtures with energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures at
the East Metro, Boulder, and District Shops operating facilities. We are now able to quantify our savings
and are realizing average savings of approximately $3,000/month at East Metro due to the combination
of solar and lighting upgrades; Boulder is showing approximately $500/month in savings with a lighting
upgrade, and to date District Shops is even.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function and is intended to provide the DOR
with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by vendors. In
2013, an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and the DOR was completed. Subsequent
to issuing an RFP, RTD contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), an audit firm with substantial
experience providing compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities. After a series of
meetings among RTD, DOR, and RRG to discuss procedures, audit candidates were identified and
several were released by DOR for RRG to begin audit review. The actual audit program was launched on

Packet Pg. 48

1.D.5

April 1 of this year. To date, 37 audits are underway but none are final so no dollars have been
recovered yet. Of these, so far six have been identified as having recovery potential. We continue to
work with RRG to identify audit candidates and qualify them with DOR.
Naming Rights
The Board approved RTD securing the services of a corporate sponsorship and naming rights consultant,
and RTD entered into a contract with the internationally known firm IMG. IMG presented to the Board in
2013 an inventory and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that may lend themselves
to naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. IMG completed the valuation of RTD assets for corporate
sponsorships and naming rights and was given the green light to begin pursuing potential clients. On
July 1, a legal notice and news release officially announced the launch of the program. IMG has been
actively meeting with potential partners. Any proposed naming rights/corporate sponsorship contract
will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Near-Term Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
near-term priority and their status are as follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could be
perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking was
amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running times,
allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and provides for
maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into agreements with
CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use tax
compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself, the
Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement with

Packet Pg. 49

1.D.5

DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with simplification of
state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items taxed.

Second Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2014. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 23 performance
measures tracked, RTD met 19 of the goals in their entirety in the second quarter vs. 17 in the first
quarter. Improvement occurred in most measures over the first quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q2; however, we are
experiencing improvement in Q2 in nearly all categories. Only RTD Local and First TransitLongmont Local slipped below Q1 results. Both Veolia and First Transit-Denver exceeded goal in
Q2. Staff continues to study the worst performing routes and identify the resources needed to
improve. As staff targeted efforts continue, on-time performance is showing improvement.
Light Rail on-time service also improved over Q1 and exceeded goal. The issue with the faulty train
APC sensors that affected Q1 results has been resolved.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due
to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavy/longer
load times; the level of complaints has been consistent. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the
valid issues.
In Q2, the three carriers RTD, First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont met or
exceeded goal. Veolia remained static and First Transit-Denver slightly missed goal. Staff provides
an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue, EcoPass Revenue, and Total Revenue
The District did not meet its goal for overall increase in fare revenue in Q2, largely due to the
timing of pass revenue recognition. We recognize pass revenue over the year based on accounting
rules and this does not coincide with actual sales (and seasonality). Also, the timing of actual pass
sales in purchased transportation results in adjustments to revenue recognized for a period and this

Packet Pg. 51

1.D.6

appears to be a factor as well. As a result, Q2 fare revenue does not mirror the ridership increase
but the variability is expected to smooth out during the remainder of the year. We will continue to
research the factors causing these variances as we are reporting a decline in fare revenue from Q1.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high level of vacancies
in this category and recruitment is on-going. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth,
and the strong local economy.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.

Due to the CAD/AVL and APC systems, on-time performance data is being generated on-line and is more accurate. We continue
to focus on the worst performing bus routes and identify the resources needed to improve. The GM is reviewing the action steps
currently being taken and considering changes that may be necessary. RTD Local, Veolia, and First Transit-Longmont showed
improvement over last year. Regional & Express on-time service also improved over 2013.
3
Performance is directly related to faulty train APC sensors which resulted in a much smaller than normal sample before the
problem was discovered and rectified. This has skewed the results.
4
Improvement in Q2 is evident in nearly all categories. Only RTD Local and First Transit-Longmont Local slipped below Q1
results.
