## II. August Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Sisk asked Interim General Manager Genova if there were any concerns or new items added to the agenda.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve moving the agenda forward to the full Board meeting of August 18, 2015.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Sisk began walking through the agenda and asked if there would be a General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update.  Director Bagley indicated that he was here to talk about this item when we get to the action item of the 2016 General Manager goals.

Chair Sisk noted that under item C, Authorization of fiscal authority to the General Manager for North Metro Rail Line project, that Director Anderson had voted no.  He asked her if her questions had been answered.  Director Anderson responded that they had been addressed by staff both in writing and via phone call.  She had also learned that Commerce City is taking on the issue to address condominium law and she had received the amounts for the in-kind services.

Chair Sisk noted that item D, Approval of the SBP Budget Plan that five Board members had votedagainst it.  Interim General Manager Genova indicated that Heather Copp, CFO, is in the process of contacting the Board members to see if she could address their concerns.

Several of the Board members commented on how well Heather is doing and how she just jumped into this.  Interim General Manager Genova indicated she is a great addition to the team.  Director Tobiassen noted that she is also an asset to the Salaried Pension Plan Trustee Board.

On item E, award contract for the supply of 36 mall shuttle buses, Director Menten indicated that she still has some open questions and would be getting in touch with Steve Gieske on this issue.

For item F, it was noted that Director Folska had abstained on this motion of sponsorship naming rights.  Chair Sisk asked if this should have still shown up on unanimously               consent.  Paula Perdue indicated that she understands an abstention is treated as a no vote.  Some of the Board members expressed they felt the proper course of action would have been that Director Folska excused herself from participation in any of the discussion.  The question arose on the proper way to handle abstention and if members need to provide an explanation.  Paula Perdue shared that yes, the Board members should provide an explanation for abstaining.  What happened in the last update of the Bylaws is language was changed to add what a person needs to do if they have a conflict of interest.  In the process, the language requiring them to provide an explanation for their reason was omitted from the Bylaws.  Board and Committee members should ask for a reason for abstaining; however, the Bylaws do not require it at this time.

Director Walker asked what the recourse was if a person did not provide a reason.  Paula Perdue said she is not sure but as elected officials, they should govern themselves accordingly.

Some of the discussion centered on if the Board member should have recused herself, by not participating in the conversation or even leaving the room.  There were feelings expressed around if recuse should be treated differently than an abstain.   Director Tobiassen expressed there is a difference.  There are specific parameters around when a person should recuse and a person can abstain for a number of reasons, not all a conflict of interest.  There are tests which should be applied.  He felt legal should have been consulted on this issue.  Paula Perdue shared that legal was consulted on if she should abstain.  Abstain is the umbrella under which several things fall including recuse.  There are different reasons why a person may abstain but the reason should be stated.

Director Bagley expressed that everyone needs to be educated on the issue of abstaining and what the normal procedures are.

Chair Sisk expressed that as Chair, he will start requesting members for a reason that they abstained.

Item G, Approval of Interim General Manager’s 2016 goals—Director Bagley indicated that was the primary reason that he and Director Anderson were at the meeting.  He will miss the Board meeting next week and he wanted the Executive Committee to understand what went down in the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee.  Director Bagley indicated that 5 members of the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee were at the Executive Committee meeting.

He provided a precursor to the discussion. We normally do a survey monkey twice a year, once in the first quarter and again in October.  Because the General Manager left around that time, we did not do one in the spring and the GM Oversight and Performance Management committee voted to not do one in the fall of 2015.  Pertaining to the General Manager’s annual evaluation, we had a contract with Phil Washington but since he has left, this contract is voided.  Interim General Manager Genova does not have a contract. The option exercised by the Committee to provide a discretionary performance payout were terms in General Manager Washington’s contract and would only apply to the new General Manager should these be terms added to his contract.  The State Auditors in 2010 were concerned with how we had done bonuses and provided some pretty restrictive language about the need for good measurements and goals.  Any plans for a new contract will take this into consideration.

What we have now are five core goals that come from the General Manager’s job description.  Given the updated job description that the GM Executive Search Committee has created for the vacancy, it makes sense to look at these goals for the new contract. The concern he has is in the preparation of the task goals in having a new General Manager and what criteria we will have to have.  These task goals should drive the budget and for the 2016 budget, we are already 1 month late.

Director Menten had provided some correspondence with proposed changes in three of the core goals and two of the task goals.  Director Bagley noted these goals were discussed in the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee and all of them were voted down either by 4-2 or 5-1 with Director Menten always dissenting.   The overall vote on this action item was five in favor and one opposed (Menten).  He wanted to share this information for it is important that we get these goals approved.

Chair Sisk asked a fundamental question.  Did Interim General Manager Genova take on the 2015 goals?    Dave indicated that he did.  Will Dave be eligible for the consideration of the discretionary performance payout?  Committee Chair Bagley indicated there are no contractual obligations but it is the discretion of his committee to provide a recommendation for a discretionary performance payout to Dave for the 2015 accomplishments.  Dave will have been in charge for about 9 months of that time.

Chair Sisk asked Director Menten if she had any comments pertaining to the statements by Director Bagley.  Director Menten indicated this was her first time on the committee so she was learning how things go.  She had noted that in the committee’s discussion, they had not discussed the core goals.  In looking at the core goals, she had some concerns and felt it was the right time to bring them forward.  She thinks the core goals are stale and need to be looked at by the Committee.  This was not an option that was provided by the Committee Chair.

Director Bagley indicated there was the whole issue of employee survey.  Director Menten had thought one of the goals should be changed to require an employee survey with 90% rating.  Staff had already hired a firm to do an employee survey and there were no ratings higher than 50%.  He does not feel we should change horses in mid-stream.  Director Bagley referenced the corrected August 4 minutes and asked if they could be sent out to the full Board.  Paula Perdue indicated that was his choice but as a matter of course, we have not been sending out the minutes from the General Manager Oversight and Performance Evaluation Committee nor the GM Executive Search Committee.  However, everything is open if requested.

Director Bagley stated that Director Menten had first requested 90% and then shifted to 70% without any thoughtful discussion or rhyme or reason for the relevancy of this percentage.

Director Menten indicated she would like all of the minutes put on the website.  She had received inquiries from a constituent who was looking for the minutes.

Director Menten also indicated that she had started with a 90% rating from internal survey but had moved that down to 70%.  If you look at the results provided by Interim General Manager Genova from the employee survey performed, this 70% is not too far off.

Chair Sisk concluded the discussion by stating he thought the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee was the appropriate place for the discussion and he is happy that they had the discussion.  He agrees with Director Bagley that the minutes should be disseminated to the full Board.

## III. Other Matters

- Director Menten had pulled up Robert’s Rules on her Smart phone and according to what she saw, it said abstaining should not be counted as a no vote.  She stated she agreed that Director Folska should not have participated in the discussion leading to the vote where she abstained.  Paula Perdue indicated it was her understanding from Rolf in legal that an abstain is treated the same as a no.  It really does not matter in this discussion anyway.  Just the mere fact that there was an abstention would have moved this item to recommended action, not unanimous consent.  She will do further research.

- Director Tobiassen announced that John McCuskey with E-470 has announced his retirement.  This is another important position with a vacancy.

- Interim General Manager Genova provided a couple of items:

o        The link to the new RTD promotional video has been provided to the Board and the community.  This is a good promotional video that tells the RTD story of the family of services that we provide.  As he has been meeting with employees and Board members, they indicated that our story is bigger than FasTracks so this video incorporates some of these other services like call-n-ride.

o        He wanted to provide an update on the Health and Welfare negotiations.  The Committee may recall that we had replaced the representation with three new trustees who are doing a better job of keeping the leadership informed.  They have been working with the represented to make changes in the plans that are offered.  It is important to know that with these changes, RTD costs could go up.  They are actively studying this but appear at a stalemate.  RTD recently received a letter from the union requesting this issue goes to arbitration.  When we made the last change, the employees’ contribution costs increased and RTD also had to increase the amount for the plan.  We are not sure with arbitration what this could look like.  Director Menten reminded the Board she was not in favor of the stopgap measure that was approved in August of 2014 that was supposed to go through the year of 2015.  What she noted was although some of the union employees may not be participating in the plan, RTD still made contributions based on every employee to the tune of approximately $1.7M over 17 months for employees not in the plan.

o        Interim General Manager Genova reported that on August 21, the acting FRA Director will come to Denver to look at some of the things we are doing including positive train control.  He also said someone from Phoenix will be coming to Denver next week.

o        Interim General Manager Genova reported that the Office of Inspector General will be doing reviews of several projects around the country.  The RTD Eagle project is one of those selected to be reviewed.  Linda Gerske is working with them to determine the scope of the review.

- Chair Sisk stated that we need to find a way to shorten our meetings.  We have got to shorten our committee meetings.  Interim General Manager indicated staff has discussed this and is sensitive to this as well.  Director Anderson suggested that perhaps one way is by Board members being more responsible to read their packets ahead of time and get their questions answered before coming to the meeting.

## IV. Adjourn

The meeting adjourned at 1:05 p.m.
