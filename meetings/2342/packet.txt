Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

Subject:

Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2015

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On July 14, staff provided an update on the 2015 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. There have been no changes to the
project information since that presentation. However, at that meeting, the Board requested additional
detail on the miscellaneous projects included in the FasTracks program. The July 14 presentation and
the additional requested detail are attached.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2014 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$3.6 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2014.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily
reflect updates to the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation.
The project cost increases for the 2015 APE capital budget are summarized below:



Construction of additional passing sidings to improve service reliability along the corridor and
facilitate the future completion of the full corridor to 162nd Avenue, approved by the Board in
October 2014.
Additional improvements to the North Metro Corridor:

Packet Pg. 5

2.12.A

Additional hazardous materials costs resulting from additional engineering and soil
testing along the corridor, as well as from negotiations with adjacent property owners
o Property-related impacts resulting from detailed engineering, relocation of the single
remaining freight shipper along the corridor to mitigate impacts on its operations, and
mitigation required at the National Western Stock Show
o Operating and maintenance interface with the Eagle Project, including equipment for
additional North Metro vehicles in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, developing
and integrating the North Metro communications and control system, and improving
service reliability along the corridor.
 Updated planning and cost estimates for the Central Rail Extension
 Additional funds required for interface between I-225 and East Rail lines at Peoria Station
 Additional closeout work for the West Rail Line
 Additional funds for staffing, marketing, education and promotion of the five corridors
scheduled to open in 2016
 Funding to conduct a federal funding feasibility analysis to identify the best candidate project
for future New Starts or Small Starts funding out of the remaining partially funded projects.
This analysis will not proceed unless a preliminary in-house analysis determines that at least
one of the remaining projects meets the current FTA criteria for entry into the New Starts or
Small Starts process.
The 2015 APE also identifies several projects that will not require the full amount of funds budgeted in
the 2014 APE, and contingency funds that are available to meet project needs:
o



Projects completed under the APE budget
o Denver Union Station
o Free MetroRide
o Wadsworth and Sheridan parking garages
 Other projects with updated cost projections
o Additional light rail vehicles
o Programwide capital costs
 Contingency funds available to meet project needs
o FasTracks Railroad Compliance Contingency
o FasTracks Environmental Mitigation
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the changes to the project scopes, net of the transfer approved by the Board in
October 2014 for the North Metro Rail Line project, is $48.8 million. These changes will be funded
through the reallocation of $34.7 million from contingency funds and projects completed under budget,
and a reduction of $14.1 million in the FasTracks Management Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors approve the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.

Packet Pg. 6

2.12.A

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the 2015 APE. This is not recommended
because FasTracks would not have an updated capital budget in place to manage the program
through 2019.

RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy Update

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the
attached advertising policy.
BACKGROUND
Currently, RTD operates an on-vehicle advertising program that accepts both commercial and non-commercial forms of
advertising. Under current policy, RTD’s advertising program creates a ‘limited public forum’ by which public service,
nonprofit and political advertisements are allowed within the guidelines established by the policy.
RTD’s Current Advertising Policy is as follows:
Advertising Policy and Objective:
It is the policy of the RTD to utilize space on the interior and exterior of its buses and light rail vehicles for commercial
advertising, RTD advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages. The primary objective of the
commercial advertising program is to maximize the net revenues to the District within the policy and standards of the
District.
Advertising Standards:
All advertising matter displayed on or in buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles shall be of a reputable character as
determined by the RTD. Objectionable advertisements shall, upon the request of a responsible officer of the RTD, be
removed immediately. All advertisements must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and Municipal laws,
ordinances and regulations within the District.
Political advertisements may be displayed only within six months of the election date. Said advertising must contain the
following disclaimer: "This Ad Paid for by (sponsor/advertiser)" and shall be subject to prior approval by RTD.
The following standards for advertising, as adopted by the RTD Board of Directors, shall be strictly adhered to by the
Advertising Company:
1. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is false, misleading, or deceptive;
2. The RTD will not display advertising copy which relates to any illegal activity under local, state or federal statute;
3. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is obscene;
4. Any advertisement not relating to a commercially available product or service including political advertising shall
include a clearly visible phrase "This Ad Paid for by (the identity of the sponsor/advertiser)". These ads shall be
subject to prior approval by the RTD; and
5. The RTD will not display advertising copy, which promotes the sale and/or use of tobacco products.
RTD has Non-Commercial Advertising Disclaimer Specifications under the current policy.
DISCUSSION
The proposed RTD Advertising Policy would establish uniform, reasonable, and viewpoint-neutral standards for the
display of advertising in and on the facilities, vehicles and other property (together "Property") of the Regional

Packet Pg. 26

2.12.B

Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and restrict the use of RTD's
Property for First Amendment political speech.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on the Property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary capacity as a
provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its transportation operations.
Starting from the Effective Date of the new Policy, the RTD does not intend that the advertising permitted to be
displayed in and on the Property be created, designated, or used as a public forum for expressive activities or
general discourse or opinions.
In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary capacity would be
limiting advertisements it will accept for display in and on the Property to paid commercial advertising, certain
public service announcements that will help provide information to the public about RTD’s own and other
government activities to help build goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the Property by subjecting all proposed
advertisements to the Advertising Standards included in the proposed RTD Advertising Policy. This proposed
advertising policy is attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is currently contracted with Lamar Advertising to receive a minimum guarantee of $4,000,000.00 in 2015,
$4,100,000.00 in 2016, and $4,200,000.00 in 2017 in advertising revenues. Non-commercial advertising accounts for
approximately $1,000,000.00 annually of those revenues. Adoption of the revised Advertising Policy may result in
an initial decrease of advertising revenue, as some advertisers will no longer qualify to participate in the RTD
Advertising program. Please also note that those advertisers are currently paying a lower rate for ads than the
commercial rate, and under the proposed updated policy, we will have only one rate. Staff also observes that some
non-commercial advertisers will be able to participate in the proposed advertising program as commercial
advertisers.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the attached proposed advertising policy, effective August 18, 2015. This alternative is the staff
recommendation.
2. Retain the existing RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended due to the creation of
a ‘public forum’ on RTD property.

RTD ADVERTISING POLICY
Advertising Program Policy and Objective:
It is the purpose of RTD’s advertising program to
 utilize space on the interior and exterior of its busses and rail vehicles for advertising purposes,
RTD Advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages to generate
revenue for the construction, operations and maintenance of the District’s facilities and
services,
 to provide information to the public by or about the District and which are produced by the
District
 to provide information to the public about federal state and local, government, programs and
activities when requested specifically by other government agencies (Government
Communications)in furtherance of RTD’s efforts to promote the welfare of the citizens of the
state of Colorado and to cooperate with its federal, state and local partners
Scope of Advertising Policy:
RTD uses the space on RTD rolling stock for the purpose of placement of advertisement only in those
locations made available by RTD for that purpose. This policy applies to sale of that space for advertising
purposes. Any naming rights or sponsorship of RTD lines or facilities will be governed by separate
policies and programs.
Designation of Forum:
It is RTD’s intent that advertising be permitted only on RTD rolling stock Advertising will not be placed in
stations, buildings, or available through RTD electronic media. RTD’s advertising space is not intended
to provide or create a public forum. RTD does not intend to accept transit advertising for noncommercial purposes except for government speech specifically describing government programs or
services. No private, non-profit, or government speech intended to advocate or oppose political
candidates, political issues, religious discourses, or advocacy of social policies will not be accepted. RTD
reserves the sole right to determine to determine the size, location and placement of advertising space
made available for sale.
Type of Advertising Permitted.
RTD will permit only commercial advertising. Commercial advertising is advertising that is designed to
promote the sale of goods or services or events promoting goods and commercial services, regardless of
whether the advertiser is a for-profit, non-profit, or government entity. Notwithstanding the above
general rule requiring Commercial Speech, the following content are allowed:
RTD Operations Advertising that promotes RTD transit services, programs or products, including cosponsorships with commercial or governmental third parties that would increase ridership or otherwise
support RTD’s mission.
Public Service Advertisements from Local, State or Federal Governmental Agencies regarding public
programs, public services and public events that are not otherwise prohibited under this Policy.

CEO

Date: July 29, 2015

Date:

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

Subject:

Updated Authorization of Fiscal Authority to
the General Manager for the North Metro Rail
Line Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”)
increase the authority granted to the General Manager or designee to enter into all contracts, real
property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56
million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and
execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications; agreements for the
acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and intergovernmental agreements that are necessary
or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project
budget. This action is consistent with previous board actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation
(APE).
BACKGROUND
As part of the RTD FasTracks Plan, the full North Metro Corridor is an approximately 18.5-mile-long
Commuter Rail line extending from Denver Union Station through the City and County of Denver, the
Cities of Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and parts of Adams County.
In November, 2013, the Board authorized actions related to the North Metro Rail Line project:
 Award of a design/build contract to Regional Rail Partners (RRP) for construction of the North
Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue, with options to extend to 162nd
Avenue as funds become available.
 Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts and
intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Rail Line Project in the amount not to exceed
the remaining project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million.
 Provided the General Manager or designee with authority to accept grants or other contributions
and to increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work
without further Board approval.
 Approved intergovernmental agreements (IGA) with the City of Commerce City, the City of
Thornton, and the City of Northglenn regarding the North Metro Rail Line project. Each IGA
includes specific terms defining the local agency contribution, coordination, and the rights and
responsibilities of each party within the boundaries of each municipality.
 Approved an IGA with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) regarding the North
Metro Rail Line project, including specific terms defining the coordination between CDOT and
RTD and the rights and responsibilities of each party associated with the construction of the
North Metro Rail Line, especially regarding interface with the state highway system.
In May, 2014, the Board approved the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs) to fund a portion
of the North Metro Rail Line project, using the section of the corridor from Denver Union Station to 104th

Packet Pg. 31

2.13.C

Avenue as collateral for the COPs. RTD issued the COPs in the par amount of $441 million in July
2014.
In October, 2014, the Board authorized the transfer of $16 million from FasTracks Railroad Right of Way
budget to a project to construct additional track sidings on the North Metro Rail Line to improve
operational reliability. The Board did not increase the General Manager’s contract authority for the
project at that time.
DISCUSSION
The intense nature of construction projects requires quick decision making capability at the project level.
Failure to provide direction to contractors in a timely manner can result in delays or expensive rework.
Delays in approving change orders can also delay payments to contractors and subcontractors.
Similarly, the ability to acquire, dedicate exchange or dedicate property and property interests, enter into
third party agreements for goods, services, funds or mutually desirable change orders may be required in
time frames that are more abbreviated than board cycles.
Providing this delegation is consistent with previous Board actions for major corridor projects. Based on
this experience, the Board delegated fiscal authority to the amount of the remaining project budget at
the same time that it approved the contract for construction of the project.
Since that time, changes to the project scope and external conditions have necessitated changes in the
project budget, as described below:


Construction of additional passing sidings to improve service reliability along the corridor and
facilitate the future completion of the full corridor to 162nd Avenue.
 Additional hazardous materials costs resulting from additional engineering and soil testing along
the corridor, as well as from negotiations with adjacent property owners
 Property-related impacts resulting from detailed engineering, relocation of the single remaining
freight shipper along the corridor to mitigate impacts on its operations, and mitigation required at
the National Western Stock Show
 Operating and maintenance interface with the Eagle Project, including equipment for additional
North Metro vehicles in the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, developing and integrating the
North Metro communications and control system, and improving service reliability along the
corridor.
The breakdown of the requested fiscal authority for the North Metro Rail Line is detailed below:
Original Project Budget
Recommended Contract Authority Increases
North Metro Sidings - Approved October 2014
Hazardous Materials, Property Impacts, O&M
Interface with Eagle - August 2015 Approval
Subtotal – Recommended Contract Authority
Increases
Updated Contract Authority

$633.8
$16.0
40.0
$56.0
$689.8

FINANCIAL IMPACT
In November, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a total budget of $633.8 million for the remaining
construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue. Funding for this
contract and the associated RTD cost of construction was provided through the staff identified and

Packet Pg. 32

2.13.C

Board approved $90 million from the Eagle project savings, use of existing fund balances, and issuance
of COPs to provide $430 million in construction funds. These funds were augmented in October 2014
through a transfer of $16 million from the FasTracks Railroad Right of Way contingency fund, and will
be augmented by $40 million in August 2015 through reallocations of budget funds from other existing
contingency funds, reallocations from other projects completed under budget, and a reduction in the
FasTracks Management Reserve.
Funding for the years 2013-2018 is included in the FasTracks financial plan to be approved by the Board
of Directors in August 2015, with the aggregate amount of remaining funding not to exceed $689.8
million. Any further increases to the project budget will be permitted only where the increase is fully
funded by a third party.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors (“Board”) increase the authority granted to the General Manager or
designee to enter into all contracts, real property transactions and intergovernmental agreements for
the North Metro Rail Line Project by $56 million to a total authorization of $689.8 million. This
authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders; change orders
and contract modifications; agreements for the acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and
intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Rail Line
within the scope of the North Metro Rail Line Project. This action is consistent with previous board
actions and the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not increase the fiscal authority granted to the General
Manager or designee for the North Metro Rail Line Project, and leave the current limit of $633.8
million in place. This is not recommended as it could delay critical project actions resulting in delays
to the project efforts, expensive rework and delays in payments to contractors and subcontractors.

Approval of 2016 - 2021 Strategic Budget Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the
District. The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the sixyear time period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will
have adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to operate within
the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.
The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are
included in the TIP.
The 2016-2021 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2016-2021 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 34

2.13.D

The attached SBP incorporates the 2015 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates at this time. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee on August 11th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on August 18th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2016-2021 projected cash flow through the extension of
the 2015 Amended Budget. The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2015” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and
subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
March sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, and reductions, eliminations or
deferrals of SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this
period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2016-2021 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $131.3 million in 2016 is forecast to be 10% higher than 2015 due to
a fare rate increase in concert with the new fare structure to be rolled out in 2016.
Fare revenue increases by 10% again in 2019 per Board policy of consideration of a
10% fare rate increase every 3 years. No fare rate increases have occurred since
2011. The SBP conservatively assumes zero ridership increase through 2021. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March quarterly update from the CU-Leeds School
of Business for the years 2015-2021. (Line 2)
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known
proceeds, and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area
Consumer Price Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2016. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates as follows: (Line 6)
2016:
3.1%
2017:
3.5%
2018:
3.3%
2019:
3.1%
2020:
2.8%
2021:
2.8%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be
operated by RTD in years 2016-2018 to include service enhancements on Routes L
and 324, Route 73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and
Anschutz Medical Campus Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP.
RTD costs will be reimbursed in full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from
the applicable municipalities. Determination will be made in future years whether to
continue such service at RTD’s cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide and I-225 are
allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers, and thus, Base total
expenses are reduced by the amount of the allocation. (Line 8)

Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 then escalated at the CPI rate for 2018-2021. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is budgeted at the 2016 lock price of $2.23/gallon, for a savings of $6.7
million from 2015, and then escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2016:
2.6%
2017:
2.7%
2018:
2.7%
2019:
2.5%
2020:
2.3%
2021:
2.2%
 Gasoline is budgeted at $3.00/gallon in 2016, down from $3.40 used in the 2015
Amended Budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense projects”)
are included. This is detailed in Exhibit III. (Line 11)
The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year beginning in 2014. (Line 12)
Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year
(both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Projected
interest payments on future debt issues use current municipal interest rate forward curves
incorporated in debt amortization schedules. (Line 16)
Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects and
replacements. This is detailed in Exhibit II. (Line 19)
The capital carryforward estimate is shown for 2015 and 2016. (Line 20)
Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund,
staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund be maintained at a minimum of $3.0 million each year until each fund reaches the
minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur in 2019. (Lines 21, 22, 32,
and 33)
Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in accordance
with fleet schedules, and debt issued for building construction (assumed to be a LRV
maintenance facility in 2019 and bus maintenance facility in 2021). (Line 24)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. (Line
25)
The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted yearend fund balance. In 2019, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to exceed
the target balance of $30 million. (Line 31)

Exhibit II attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned capital projects during the
SBP period in uninflated 2015 dollars.
Exhibit III
Exhibit III attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned operating and maintenance
projects during the SBP period in uninflated 2015 dollars.
Exhibit IV

Packet Pg. 36

2.13.D

Exhibit IV attached to this document is a listing of capital and operating projects deferred from
2016 that were submitted for consideration during the SBP development process. The SBP
was balanced largely by deferral from 2016 to 2017 of these projects requested for 2016. In
2017, the SBP generates sufficient cash flow to support these deferred projects from 2016.
Exhibit V
Exhibit V attached to this document is a chart of capital projects by type for the current and
last three SBP periods.
Exhibit VI
Exhibit VI attached to this document is a chart of operating and maintenance projects by type
for the current and last three SBP periods.
The 2016-2021 SBP planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI rate
starting in 2016:

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts
are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted yearend fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales
tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to
have an impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the
2016 budget period.
Current key financial (fund balance) indicators for the SBP are:

ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 37

2.13.D

1. Adoption of the 2016-2021 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2016-2021 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2016 budget
process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2016 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2016-2021
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2016 budget process.

Project Description

LRV Purchase of 12
LRVs

This is the first request for purchase of 12 LRVs to
increase the fleet size to 184. O&M costs are for
oversight meetings and on-site inspection.

Rail Operations

LRV Purchase of 15
LRVs

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the
demands of the existing LRT system and accommodate
the opening of the I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to
the current procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was
included in the 2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to
bring the spare ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet
the anticipated growth in ridership, we need to purchase
fifteen (15) additional vehicles by 2020 (Base System=15,
FasTracks=2). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201.

Capital Requests

Project is an annual program consisting of $300,000 for
Districtwide
transit and/or passenger related improvements, upgrades,
and/or supplemental funding of requested transit
improvements by local governments such as bus pads,
passenger waiting areas, passenger shelters and
benches. In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive
a FASTER grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good
Repair type projects. These funds will be used to fund
RTD projects that would otherwise have been funded by
RTD base system funds. However, as part of this stipend,
CDOT expects RTD to provide an additional $150,000 of
grants to local governments for transit projects. The funds
from this SBP request will be added to the SBP Local
Government pool so that RTD can meet the terms of the
FASTER stipend and have a meaningful pool of funds to
respond to local government requests.

Asset Management
Program Planning and
Implementation

Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system District Shops that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or Operations
group. IT asset management is the set of business
Center
practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic
decision making for the IT environment. This is also one
of the processes defined within IT service management.
The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for
the current and future computing size of the District. A
more robust integrated system is needed for
hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration
control, and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes
the tracking of computers, servers, software, mobile
devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops, monitors,
etc.

This project will implement a district-wide comprehensive Districtwide

consolidate 65 existing systems that create, capture or
store content at RTD. The project scope will include the
development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and
metadata for the consistent identification, storage,
maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of data.
The project also will include identification of personnel
and tools required to implement the policies and
procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the
ongoing utilization of the system.
The current project cost estimate assumes that RTD will
own and maintain the hardware and software in-house.
The first phase of this project includes an evaluation of
potential ECM tools, which will include externally hosted
systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems. If a
hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project will change.

The Call-n-Ride vehicles are equipped with DLT rugged

Operations
used by RideChecker personnel to gather infield ridership Center
information, being managed by the same group.
Currently, there are a total of 67 mobile tablets in use: 52
Call-n-Ride and 15 RideChecker. In 2013, 20 machines
were replaced with the Panasonic H2 Tablet, leaving 47
needing replacement in 2015, with 15 in dire need. Even
though the tablets are ruggedized, they still have a higher
break rate than a standard PC that resides within an office
setting. The total number of on-shelf inventory needs to
increase to accommodate time involved with break/fix full
turnaround. An additional 8 tablets are needed in order to
reduce service interruption that has been an issue for
several years. Also, the unit hardware will be set to a 3
year life cycle. Request is based on increased unit
numbers: 55 Call-n-Ride, and 20 RideChecker for a total
of 75 in service and ready inventory tablets.

TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the
Civic Center
past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult Plaza (CCP)
to use and limited in its functionality. Various
departments/projects like Communications, Fastracks,
and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to
collect customer feedback that is not integrated. The
recommendation from the Smart Card Business Process
Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD procure and
implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would
meet the needs of all departments and projects. The first
phase (2015) of this project is to initiate an enterpise-level
study to perform a needs analysis, develop processes
and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and
future needs of RTD. The second phase (2016) is to
purchase and implement an enterpise CRM. If the CRM
study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding
would drop and be replaced with annual expense and IT
would only need to request 1 new FTE.

The Light Rail SCADA team and IT Network group are
Civic Center
spending a significant effort in 2015 to separate the
Plaza (CCP)
SCADA network and the corporate network infrastructure.
This separation is necessary in order to isolate and
protect the SCADA network for the safety and security of
the District. Once complete, a need still exists for RTD to
collect data from the SCADA network, which will consist
of train location data (based on track sensors) to support
the real-time project. This can be accomplished in a safe
and secure manner by implementing a bi-directional flow
of network traffic from the SCADA network to the
corporate network without allowing any access to SCADA
assets. This is implemented through a waterfall (unidirectional) firewall device. This request is to procure the
hardware necessary to implement this solution. Real
Time Passenger Information (RTPI) will provide RTD
passengers with predictive arrival times for their next bus.
IT and Marketing are working toward providing predictive
arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems:
General Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or
GTFS-RT (which will provide the information to Google
Maps and some third party application developers),
Passenger Information Display (PID) signs, and the RTD
website.

New functionaity will include:
1) Automated attendance (through self-service portal and
IVR - integrated voice recording) for processing routine
attendance requests (for example, requesting a sick day).
2) Automated run bidding and vacation bidding.
Elimination of paper and manual communication and

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District Shops - $
District information and computing services. A wide array Operations
of departments and applications use these storage units Center
to store mission-critical data. Computer data storage,
often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting
of computer components and recording media used to
retain digital information. It is a core function and
fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates
raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts
fast but expensive and small storage options close to the
CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther
away. In computing, a portfolio of storage products,
including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and
backup software are required to run the Enterprise.

Currently, whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license
agreement), it utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to
establish the location of that property right on the ground,
and prepare Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and
exhibits. The contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of
2016. Jacobs has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD)
files, information on adjoining properties, subdivision
plats, ALTA surveys, legal descriptions, and other
electronic and paper records regarding RTD properties
going back to 1997. The extent of this information is
estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be equated
to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information. These
documents also include information on utilities that cross,
or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.Organizations that have assets in various
geographic locations typically utilize Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) to record and analyze their
asset base. Utilities and local municipalities are examples
of such organizations. RTD has been using GIS systems
for about 15 years. Currently, these systems are used
mostly used by the Telephone Information Center (TIC),
Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is also getting
started on projects like real-time train arrival information,
which would also need GIS support.This project request is
to sort through Jacobs property survey records, bring this
information within RTD, and organize it on an engineering
GIS platform. Initially, the system will house information
on properties, utilities, track, pnR’s, crossings, and
structures. The system can be expanded to include other
items like the catenary system.

Real-Time Passenger
Information Integration
with Light Rail SCADA
System

The real-time project team is working on collecting track- Mariposa Light
based train location information from the Light Rail
Rail Division
SCADA system. In order to obtain real-time train location
information for LRVs, modifications to RTD’s light rail train
tracking system (SCADA) are needed to provide a realtime data feed from track-based events including when a
vehicle passes through TWC (train to wayside
communicator) and the beginning and end of track
segments (included in the Integration request). During a
feasibility study, we identified an issue in the Denver
downtown area where the frequency of TWCs along the
tracks are not frequent enough to provide optimal train
locations. This has been referred to as a "dark territory".
To enhance the data feed, auto-scopes (cameras) can be
used to augment data through the following events: 1)
Video track segment occupancy (VTO). This update will
occur when the control system has determined from input
received from a video camera that a train has arrived in a
section of track associated with that specific camera. 2)
Video track segment vacancy (VTV). This update will
occur when the control system has determined from input
received from a video camera that a train has departed
from a section of track associated with that specific video
camera. This request is to install new auto-scopes at key
downtown stations to enable this.

delivery of real-time data to PIDs and the website is
expected to be ready no later than Q2 2016. The majority
of effort in making RTPI available lies in gathering existing
information from various sources, converting this
information into a common format that in turn can feed
multiple end-user sources including mobile devices.
Current scope of the project only includes bus
information. Request is to extend scope to include data
from our LR system. To do so, we need to make
modifications to RTD’s light rail train tracking system
(SCADA) to provide a real-time data feed from track

Station
savings was accomplished by eliminating Automatic Bus Complex
RFID Reader Technology and In Ground Emergency
Portal Pop-up Barriers. A physical network connection to
existing “Starters Stations” and the DUS Security Office
was also eliminated. The project has been redesigned to
work in conjunction with Phase 1 Guard Booths that will
be manned by security 24/7. The project will include
redesign work and the addition of Electric Gate Arms at
each entry portal and will be manually controlled from the
Guard Booth as authorized vehicles approach. The
project will also include additional signage and a "Red

Opportunity grant to fund a capital project to reduce travel
time and increase security and ridership for 15L bus
route. The project includes: stop amenity improvements
(repair and replace existing amenities, lighting, shelters,
security cameras), bus bulbs at a few locations, transit
signal priority (TSP), and bypass lanes/queue jumps. The
project includes East Colfax from Broadway east to
Potomac (near I-225). It is important to note that from
Yosemite to Potomac, the project will only include
improved stop amenities. RTD local match is $1.83M.

Northwest Rail
Bus Rapid Transit @ SH Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor to connect
Line
119
Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the
recommendation of the Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS). It is anticipated that approximately half of the
total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The
establishment of BRT in the corridor would raise ridership
from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000 daily
weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and
design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance study and preliminary
engineering, previously approved in the SBP. The project
is anticipated to take two years to construct. This request
is for the first year of construction.

DRCOG, through the Transportation Improvement
Districtwide
Program (TIP), has allocated $1 million in funding for FY
2017 for this project. RTD would be required to provide a
25 percent local match of $250,000. Given the results of
the Northwest Area Mobility Study, which showed
substantial bus ridership increases from modest capital
improvements made to arterial corridors, there has been
much interest from other areas of the District for RTD to
make arterial BRT investments in other corridors. The
purpose of this study will be to examine the potential for
arterial BRT investments throughout the entire District and
prioritize for future capital investment those corridors
which perform the highest.

strategies could include:
- additional bus transfer facilities
- pedestrian improvements
- bike access improvements
- improved bike storage
- expanded or new drop off/pick up areas
- transit speed and reliability improvements on bus routes
connecting to the station
The plan would identify potential partnerships with other
public and private entities to implement these strategies.
Finally, the plan would prioritize potential improvements
based on their impact.

Datacenter Cloud Study A data center is a facility used to house computer
systems and associated components, such as
Station
(WO)
telecommunications and storage systems. Large data
Complex
centers are industrial scale operations using as much
electricity as a small town.RTD remains as dependent as
ever on its primary data center located at District Shops to
meet its objectives. Rigorous data center capacity
planning and management is critical to serving today's
enterprise. These disciplines are required to insure that
the data center can accommodate the needs of the
business. RTD's District Shops datacenter has reached
the number of equipment / devices it can reasonably store
without causing damage RTD must look to expand the
datacenter.

Enterprise Content
Management
Implementation + 4
FTEs

This project will implement a district-wide comprehensive Districtwide
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution to
consolidate 65 existing systems that create, capture or
store content at RTD. The project scope will include the
development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and
metadata for the consistent identification, storage,
maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of data.
The project also will include identification of personnel
and tools required to implement the policies and
procedures, implementation of the system, and the
training and audit tools to support the ongoing system.The
current project cost estimate assumes that RTD will own
and maintain the hardware and software in-house. Six
new FTEs planned for post-implementation after mid2018 (5 records analysts, 1 ECM systems analyst).

Unit Replacement

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District Shops - $
District information and computing services. A wide array Operations
of departments and applications use these storage units Center
to store mission-critical data. Computer data storage,
often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting
of computer components and recording media used to
retain digital information. It is a core function of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a
computer is what manipulates raw information by
performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU
and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.

IT Managed Services Tier 1 Support

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to
Districtwide
compete effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the
resources needed to support this increasingly complex IT
environment may not. In many areas, IT resources are
limited and can be quickly overwhelmed.
We have seen from prior instances that if we fall behind in
keeping up with things such as backups, patches and
security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD
rolls out real- time information to the customer and we
have an outage, it will negatively impact customers' view
of RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: August 4, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: August 18, 2015

Subject:

Award Contract for the Supply of 36 Mall
Shuttle Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract with BYD Motors, Inc. for
the supply of 36 – 45’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare components in an amount not to exceed
$27,100,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has initiated the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance mall shuttle sub-fleet.
RTD’s existing TransTeq mall shuttle buses are currently between 14 and 15 years old. They have
exceeded their service life of 12 years, become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep
them in service. Some of the mall buses have experienced structural fatigue failure or other major
problems that have kept them out of service. The bus manufacturer, TransTeq, went out of business
over 10 years ago. Many of the parts required for the repair of the buses are no longer available. The
current mall bus fleet is not sustainable for continued passenger service.
The mall shuttle buses are unique because of the many unique features necessary for the bus operation
in the pedestrian mall environment, such as right hand operator position, 45’ in length, 3 to 4 wide
passenger doors, completely low and flat floor, etc. Industry standard bus manufacturers, such as Gillig
and New Flyer, do not have such bus type in production and do not want to expend their resources in
the engineering and manufacture of the buses because of their low potential sales volume. A small
number of specialty bus manufacturers that produced the mall bus type in the past, such as TransTeq
and DesignLine, went out of business after a short time in existence. To allow more bids for the supply
of the new mall buses, RTD opened up the procurement process not only to domestic market suppliers
but also to the larger international market. Only two companies, both international, submitted their
proposals. No high-volume legacy US bus manufacturer’s submitted proposals. Other international bus
manufacturers that could produce buses meeting RTD requirements did not submit their proposals
because of the high cost to bring the foreign-produced buses into compliance with the US vehicle safety
regulations.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FK-005 in June of 2014. Two proposals were received on
September 9, 2014. Shaw International, Inc. proposed conventional CNG buses, and BYD Motors, Inc.
proposed fully electric buses. The proposed pricing is listed below.

2.13.E

Shaw International, Inc. – CNG Buses
BYD Motors, Inc. – Electric Buses

$666,855 per bus
$748,051 per bus

Shaw International is a distributor for King Long Bus of China. King Long Bus is one of China’s largest
coach and bus manufacturers, annually producing 25,000 buses and over 30,000 mini vans. The
proposed buses would be produced entirely in China and imported into the US.
BYD Motors is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BYD Ltd, which is 50% US owned through shareholders.
Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway is the company’s single largest shareholder with 9.9%. BYD is a
large international corporation established in 1995 with over 200,000 employees worldwide. BYD is the
world’s largest manufacturer of rechargeable batteries. It is also the largest Chinese auto manufacturer
and the world’s largest electric bus manufacturer. BYD produces over 1000 electric buses a year. BYD
has built buses similar to the mall buses with the driver position on the right for countries that have
adopted the British road rule. BYD proposed the bus chassis to be built in China, and shipped to its final
assembly plant in Lancaster, California for completing the manufacturing process. The BYD buses will
meet all US vehicle safety standards and Buy America Requirements.
Staff has evaluated the two proposals based on several criteria such as costs for initial purchase and
lifetime operation, compliance with RTD technical requirements, company’s technical and manufacturing
ability and its experience in the US transit bus market.
Costs:
Staff has performed a life cycle cost analysis of the two proposed buses to determine which bus power
configuration would result in the most cost effective, energy efficient and best value proposal.
The electric bus provides the best energy cost efficiency. Over the 12-year life span, it is estimated the
electric bus would yield a savings of $99,956, at current prices, in energy consumption over the CNG
buses. This savings would more than offset the bus purchase cost difference of $81,196. In addition,
the electric bus would eliminate many major bus components such as engine and transmission and allow
additional savings in maintenance and repair cost. The cost of ownership to include bus purchase and
operating costs over the 12-year life of the electric bus would be $139,500 per bus less than those of
the proposed CNG buses. Both power systems require modifications to the maintenance facility;
however, the cost to modify RTD’s Platte maintenance facility for operating the electric buses is
estimated at only half the cost to upgrade the CNG fuel station for operating the CNG buses,
at$405,000 for electric buses vs. $900,000 for CNG buses.

In addition, the proposed BYD electric bus cost is equally competitive to the cost, inflation adjusted, of
the diesel electric hybrid bus in previous mall bus purchases. It is lower than the RTD internal cost
estimate. It is also within the RTD existing budget for unit bus cost.

2.13.E

Technical Specifications:
The BYD proposed bus meets all of RTD’s technical requirements to include some desirable features
such as efficient use of the bus floorplan to allow a large passenger capacity of 111, full rear window,
passenger air conditioning, zero emissions and low noise, etc. The proposed King Long bus is less
efficient in passenger capacity caused by the large space occupied by the full sized CNG bus engine and
transmission connecting to a regular low floor rear axle. This results in a smaller passenger area behind
the rear axle. Its passenger capacity is 18% lower than the BYD electric bus, at 94 vs 111. The Shaw
proposed bus does not have a full sized rear window.
The electric bus is much cleaner and quieter than the CNG bus in terms of exhaust emission and noise
emission. The electric bus produces zero tailpipe emissions and is nearly silent. The CNG bus produces
higher exhaust and noise emissions. At this time, the bus industry appears to be headed toward an allelectric-bus future. In the past, the primary constraints to purchasing electric buses have been battery
capacity and cost. BYD has overcome both concerns. The BYD proposed system has demonstrated the
battery capacity to perform the mall duty cycle at a reasonable purchase cost. BYD has also eliminated a
major cost concern associated with the potential need to replace the expensive batteries, by offering a
12-year warranty on the batteries.
Bus Manufacturing Capability, Build Location and Experience in US Transit Bus Industry:
BYD buses will be assembled in Lancaster, CA. The bus build process is similar to the process employed
by a number of current bus manufacturers such as MCI and New Flyer. The bus chassis will be
manufactured outside of the US, in China, but the majority of the bus will be assembled in the US. By
being assembled in the US and containing 60% or more US contents, the proposed BYD buses will meet
the current Buy America Requirements. The BYD build process with final assembly in the US allows
RTD a greater degree of oversight during the manufacture process and faster responses to issues. As
part of its due diligence process, RTD staff has visited BYD plant in Lancaster, CA. Staff has verified
BYD’s capable bus manufacturing ability provided by its modern and efficient assembly facility.
The buses proposed by Shaw International would be built entirely in China. This provides significant
challenges for inspection, design verification, and issue resolution due to distance and language barrier.
BYD has a number of buses in service with various agencies in the US. It has recently delivered five
buses to Los Angeles MTA. It has won the contract award in Long Beach for 10 buses with options for
additional 50 buses. RTD has visited Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA) in California to review its
BYD bus operation. AVTA has two BYD buses in operation since last year. The buses have been reliable
and allowed more than 200 miles of service before needing a battery charge. In contrast, Shaw
International/King Long Bus has no buses in service in the US.

Conclusion:
The evaluation by Staff indicates the proposal by BYD as the best value, lowest risk proposal providing
the most advanced and clean power technology desirable for the 16th Mall Street operation at a
reasonable initial purchase cost and lowest lifetime operating cost. BYD has proposed an accelerated bus
production process. The first pilot bus is scheduled for completion of manufacturing and delivery for
testing and evaluation in April 2016. The rest of the buses are scheduled for completion between May
and September 2016.
The 45’ mall shuttle buses are fully low and flat floor with three wide passenger doors for ease of
passenger boarding and de-boarding. For safety reasons, they have the driver platform on the right
hand side similarly to existing mall buses. They will be equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two
wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their clean battery electric power system
produces zero vehicle exhaust emissions. The buses will have a passenger air conditioning system to
improve passenger comfort. They will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a
security digital camera system. They can carry up to 111 passengers to meet the heavy demand of
mall service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This mall shuttle purchase was included in the adopted 2015 Amended Budget by a carryforward and
new capital totaling $24,147,350. The remaining amount needed to complete the purchase will be
funded by a FASTER grant of $3.9 million that became available subsequent to approval of the Amended
Budget, providing for total available funding of $28M. The FASTER grant requires an equal match of
$3.9 million from local funds that will come from the budgeted $24,147,350. The $405,000 needed to
modify the maintenance facility to accommodate the enhanced charging needs associated with the
electric buses has been requested as part of the 2016 requested budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, BYD has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to award the contract to BYD for the purchase of 3645’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare parts. This is the recommended alternative.
2. To award the contract to Shaw International/King Long Bus. This is not a recommended
alternative since the company has proposed CNG bus, requiring a higher cost of owner ship. It is
also a riskier alternative due to the lack of experience of the manufacturer in the US transit
market, its entire manufacturing process in China and its non-compliance with the Buy America
Requirements. This would also contradict the results of RTD’s procurement process.
3. Do not authorize the contract award and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it may result
in a no-bid situation in the repeated procurement process with limited qualified bidders, and at the
very least would result in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the
project. This would also result in increased problems with existing mall service due to the
difficulty in keeping the TransTeq mall buses in safe and reliable operation.

Sponsorship Naming Rights Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to enter into an agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the
sponsorship naming rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer line for
a five-year period, with a mutually agreed upon right to extend this agreement for an additional five
years. Under the terms of the agreement, RTD would receive $905,000.00 in the first agreement year
with a 5% escalation factor for each contract year through year five, with the right to mutually extend
this agreement for an additional five years, also with a 5% escalation factor each year. Over the initial
five-year period of the contract, RTD would receive a gross amount of $5,000,696.00. It is further
recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board Reserve Account, which gives
the Board flexibility in determining its specific usage.
BACKGROUND
The Long Range Fiscal Sustainability Task Force, convened by the RTD Board in 2010 to explore longrange cost reductions and revenue enhancements, issued its report to the RTD Board in June, 2011.
Under the “Revenue Enhancement” category of the report, Naming Rights were included as a
recommended source of additional revenue. Specifically, the report stated, “Consider fees for naming or
‘sponsoring’ facilities (such as stations) or services (such as rail lines).” In 2012, the RTD Board of
Directors authorized the General Manager or designee to issue a Request for Proposals for a Corporate
Sponsorship/Naming Rights partner to act as an agent for RTD to seek additional revenue through such
naming rights sponsorships. RTD received five proposals, and through the procurement process the RTD
Board approved the contract award to WME/IMG In December of 2012, Notice to Proceed was provided
to WME/IMG, to pursue Naming Rights Sponsorships on behalf of RTD. Following a comprehensive
market review, research and valuation process, RTD officially announced its Sponsorship Naming Rights
program to the public in July of 2014.
DISCUSSION
Through our agent WME/IMG, RTD staff is presenting the RTD Board of Directors for review and
approval a proposed sponsorship naming rights agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the
sponsorship naming rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer. Rights
and benefits to the sponsorship naming partner are detailed in the term sheet that will be included with
the final agreement and include: naming rights to the specified rail line, advertising category exclusivity
on the rail line and advertising category exclusivity on the bus line, signage on the dedicated rail
alignment, exterior advertisements on the rail and bus vehicles, and sponsor name and logo use on RTD
digital assets and RTD printed collateral which refer to the sponsor-named line. CU will also have the
right to promote this naming rights partnership through its materials. Note that CU’s payments will be
subject to annual appropriation by their Board of Regents. A copy of the term sheet (that will be included
with the final agreement), is attached to this Board Report as Exhibit A.

2.13.F

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed sponsorship naming rights agreement will result in $5,000,696.00 in gross revenue to
support the operation of RTD services. In the first year of the agreement, a portion of the revenue will
need to be utilized for the implementation and activation of the naming right partner benefits, including
signage and updating of collateral materials. Per the Board’s previously-approved contract, our agent
WME/IMG will receive an annual payment of 12 percent of gross revenues.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or
his designee be authorized to enter into an agreement with the University of Colorado (CU) for the
sponsorship naming rights on the A Line and an exterior advertising position on the Flatiron Flyer line
for a five-year period, with a mutually agreed upon right to extend this agreement for an additional
five years. Under the terms of the agreement, RTD would receive $905,000.00 in the first
agreement year with a 5% escalation factor for each contract year up through year five, with the
right to mutually extend this agreement for an additional five years, also with a 5% escalation factor
each year. Over the initial five-year period of the contract, RTD would receive a gross amount of
$5,000,696.00. It is further recommended that the revenue from this contract be placed in the Board
Reserve Account, which gives the Board flexibility in determining its specific usage.
2. Do not enter into the proposed sponsorship naming rights agreement presented. This alternative
is not recommended because it would result in the loss of sponsorship revenue.
