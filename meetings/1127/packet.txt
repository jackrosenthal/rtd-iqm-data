C. Updates

• Government Relations Updates (State, Local, Federal)
State – Brandeberry-McKenna
Julie McKenna thanked the Board for allowing Brandeberry-McKenna to
represent RTD. They will support a bill carried by Senator Nancy Todd and
Representative Kevin Priola. They are working to help RTD increase the
sales tax collection and streamline the process in collecting what RTD should
be collecting. They are working with the Department of Revenue to make
sure that RTD is not over or under inclusive. Another legislative initiative is
to ensure that RTD is collecting taxes on items like soda pop and candy that
the State collects tax on but RTD does not.
Director Bagley stated that he looks forward to working with Julie and
Jennifer and thanked them for their past work.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 8, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Natalie Menten
Paul Solano

5.A

Director Lasater stated that in a previous meeting with a past Director, the
Director suggested self-collection for RTD. He stated that Parker and Castle
Rock entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement and began selfcollection. Between the two cities they found an additional $1.2 million and
he encourages RTD to continue this process and hopes that RTD will be able
to accomplish a similar ability which will help the agency better serve the
community with the correct funding.
Julie expressed they appreciate the support from the Board.
Local – CRL Associates
Roger Sherman congratulated all the newly elected Board members as well
as the newly elected Officers. He stated that CRL has met with a number of
county commissioners from Arapahoe, Boulder and other areas. He also
mentioned that there are some vacancies in different City Councils and they
are continually tracking those vacancies and will keep the Board informed.
He said they continue to work with the Metro Mayors and other counties
about long term transportation issues and how that ultimately helps RTD.
Director Deadwyler asked how large CRL’s staff is and how many are
working on these initiatives. Roger stated that they have 3 staff members
from CRL working for RTD. Director Deadwyler stated that she would like
to see a report that includes the outcome of the meetings instead of just a
list of meetings. Roger responded that they are the liaison with the local
officials. They can provide a government relations plan that has the goals
explained. Director Deadwyler would like to see the plan but also would like
to see what the results of those conversations are. Roger stated that it
allows them to have a better understanding of the elected officials’ point of
view.
Federal – Patton-Boggs
Mike Dino also congratulated the newly elected Officers. He stated that the
team is doing what they need to do to represent RTD. In Washington the
Government delayed the sequestration which would have taken effect last
week and reduced much of the budgeted amounts across federal agencies
including defense. They delayed sequestration because they raised revenue
on those who make $400K and above per year. He explained that most
employees will see an increase on their FICA tax for Medicare and Social
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 8, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy asked if the tax collection is being done through the State
Revenue Department or through the State Legislative Process. Julie stated
that they are working through the Department of Revenue in making sure
that the citizens within RTD’s boundaries are paying the right taxes.
Director Hoy asked if the parity portion was going through the State
Legislature and Julie stated that was correct.

Security. One of the positive things is that they increase the pre-tax dollars
for transit benefits from $120 to $240; this will encourage businesses to
invest in transit passes. He also stated this is only a two month solution;
they did not deal with debt ceiling. By the end of March they will have to
deal with the debt ceiling, the end of 2013 fiscal year since it has only been
approved until the end of March, and the budget cuts. Patton-Boggs is also
working with RTD staff on final rule by the FTA related to ridership
calculations and New Starts grants.

B. Denver Union Station Update
Bill Mosher congratulated the newly elected officers. He explained that the Denver
Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) is a consortium that includes
representatives from Denver City Council, RTD, DRCOG and DUS Metropolitan
District; it is a very diverse group which hired them to manage the project.
To-date they have spent almost $366 million. Half of the money is paid by
FasTracks and the rest by the Downtown Redevelopment Authority.
Most of the activity is on the CRT as most of the LRT is substantially completed.
The light rail plaza has been open since May 2012 and it’s a fully operational
facility.
The Bus facility has been divided into three phases, with several aspects already
completed and the rest underway. All the concrete work has been completed
behind DUS. Escalators and elevators installation is underway. They are using
skylight in order to bring light into the building. The ticket booth is in progress in
the center of the facility. Granite installation in public restrooms is nearly complete.
All venting facilities are in the west end due to the historic nature of the building.
On the commuter rail, steel fabrication for the CRT canopy is almost complete. Pier
drilling is underway for the pedestrian bridge foundation. They have canopies that
cover every train platform. The Wewatta pavilion PTFE roof is installed; glass will

be going in next. Touch up painting on north train hall canopy structural steel is
underway.
Moving toward Coors field, the rail and concrete tie storage within the throat area
is underway, but will have to wait on a portion of it until the Amtrak station is
relocated. They have started the installation of the overhead power for Tracks 1
and 2.

The Denver Union Station Renovation is underway and the goal is to finish by April
of 2014. He mentioned that on October 2011 RTD received 2 developers’
presentations. RTD selected the developer by December 2011; this renovation
includes 21,000SF for transit units, 110 hotel rooms, 19,000SF or retail and
restaurants.
RTD signed a lease contract in December 2012. They expect to
move the Amtrak station back to DUS in the spring of 2014.
Public involvement continues through ongoing communications via website and
email. Most coordination has been for the construction projects going on in 3
blocks: Wynkoop/DUS parking lot closure, Wewatta detour to Chestnut and the
two-way mall shuttle traffic.
With regard to private development, they have expedited the expectation to-date
and it is expect to be done by 2019. The total public cost of the project would be
$570 million. Parking spaces are substantially available in evening and weekends.
Bill presented a list of projects plans which the city has seen. These include 1900
16th Street, DaVita World Headquarters, North Wing Building: IMA Financial Plaza;
South Wing Building: One Union Station; Cadence Apartments; Historic Denver
Union Station; Block A – 1650 Wewatta has already been sold. 1601 Wewatta is
planned to be under construction within the next 3 months.
More information can be found at their websites: www.denverunionstation.org and
www.unionstationdenver.com.

Director Folska thanked him for the presentation and stated that she is very excited
that the project is on time and within budget. She also asked what the exact
dimensions and cost are for the pedestrian bridge. Bill Mosher stated that he is not
sure. Jerry Nery stated that it is almost 200ft, and goes over the 8 tracks. It has
mesh fencing, but it is not enclosed. It has one escalator and one elevator. The
project was priced as a whole project, but he will try to get the price for that
specific portion calculated, including elevator cost.
Director Daly asked if it will be similar to what is in DIA. Bill Mosher stated that it
is, they feel very comfortable with it, and there is air that flows through it.

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 8, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Streets and Plazas that have been completed include: LRT Plaza, 17th Street Garden
Plaza and the 16th Street from Chestnut to Wewatta. The 16th Street from
Wewatta to Wynkoop is expected to be completed in February 2013. Wewatta
Street construction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2013 and the
Wynkoop Plaza completed by November 2013.

5.B

Director Bagley asked for clarification if the multi-family around the station is for
rental. Bill stated that it is for rental and that most of the project if not all of them,
offers less than one parking space per unit.
Director Deadwyler asked if this is low income housing. Bill stated that there is a
requirement for the central plan from the city, but he was not sure on the
percentage.

C. Recommended Actions

• FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors reappoint four members of the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to an
additional three-year term and appoint one new member to the Committee to
the remainder of a three-year term to fill a vacancy.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated that they
advertised the recruitment of citizens interested in serving through the
FasTracks Website, local publications and stakeholder e-mail distribution.
Interested citizens were asked to provide a one-page letter stating their
interest and specific qualifications, related experience and resume if
available. They received 60 applications. The current members are eligible
for reappointment and four of the five current members expressed interest in
continuing to serve on the committee.
Based on attendance, participation at meetings and committee consistency,
the nominating committee recommends the reappointment of Melvin Bush,
Anne Hayes, David Lewis and Debra Wilcox. It also recommends the
appointment of Jeff Kraft to a three-year term expiring on December 31,
2015. Mr. Kraft was present at the meeting and resides in Boulder (RTD
District O). He is the marketing director for AT&T.
Motion:

Director Tayer made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at
the January 22, 2013 Board

Director Bagley thanked them for the presentation and asked if later in the year
they could offer a tour for the members of the board. Bill stated that they can give
them a walking tour in the spring. Director Bagley will work with them to
coordinate this.

Discussion:

Director Lubow asked about the nominating committee. Scott
Reed stated that it includes Scott Reed, Directors Bagley and
Cohen and Bill Van Meter from the Planning department.
Director Lubow asked if they look into socio-economic
diversity during the review.
Scott stated that all the
information is in the report. There was a fair amount of
diversity, and the selection was made based on experience.
Director Bagley stated that he has been on the committee for
several years. They received 60 applications and the Virtegic
Group screened all of them and narrowed the applications
down to 9 for interviews. Only 7 showed up for the interview
and there were several age groups, from age 22 all the way to
the mid-60s including female applicants. Mr. Kraft was the
first person interviewed and showed a phenomenal passion to
help RTD.
Director Tobiassen welcomed Mr. Kraft and acknowledged the
work of the CAC, especially Mr. David Lewis.
He also
mentioned that he is working with David Lewis and Director
Folska to put together a speakers group for the I-225 project.
Director Folska stated that this is a great initiative and that
Transit Alliance is also a great organization. She asked for the
criteria for evaluating the candidates for the CAC. Scott will
provide both the criteria and process for review. Director
Folska also asked how long has the CAC operated on behalf of
RTD. Scott responded that they have been operating since
2005. Director Folska asked if they have outreached to the
youth of the community. Scott responded that they have
worked through the colleges.
Director Folska wanted to
know if they have included youth under 18. Scott stated that
he would have to check on the requirements; he doesn’t think
there is an age limitation. She would like to see if they can
reach out to that group to participate.
Director Solano stated that the outreach needs to also extend
to the Hispanic population in Denver and include a bilingual
outreach.
Director Deadwyler asked if they can have the information
requested by Directors Folska and Solano before the Board
Meeting, especially the outreach information.
Scott will
provide the information. Director Bagley requested the
requirements to be outlined.

D. Updates

• West Rail Line Update
Jim Starling stated that through November 2012 they had the different
aspects of construction at a 97-100 percent completion, with an overall
progress 97%. November through December they conducted static testing
of individual elements. January and February they expect to conclude the
integrated testing of full systems. During March and April they will conduct
the operator/schedule testing and tie into existing system.
Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations stated that
they are in the transition point where Jim’s group is preparing to hand it over
to operations. Their rail operations staff is functioning as support for the
test activities. As the system moves alone on March 1st they will have a
system that is largely completed and all critical safety system in place with
staff trained and certified. The first 2-3 weeks in March will be training.
They will test the schedules but will not tie into the existing systems yet.
They will act as if they were in service but will not be carrying people. They
will simulate accidents and Broncos pull away.
Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security and Facilities
stated that they have a certification process in order to reach certain
milestones, including getting the system ready to go into revenue. At each
stage they issue a certificate. If there are any issues, they will create
criteria to evaluate the successful accomplishment of those milestones.

They check for hazards that they might not have anticipated and they don’t
have that many issues on the West Corridor. They will do their pre-routing
on March 1st. They will review any open item and once they have the sign
off they can move forward.
They also have a lot of reviews and
assessments by the FTA. The FTA came out in December and allowed RTD
to move forward with the integrated testing.

David Genova stated that they are also conducting safety outreach at
schools in the area, fairs/info booths, tours, website pages. They are
working with the school kids to show them how to safely cross.
There is an art selection committee made up of elected officials, citizens and
public art professionals. Staff expects to have art along different parts of
the line; some will be in place for opening day.
David Genova also mentioned that the 6th Avenue Bridge lighting will be on
January 23rd. The Grand Opening is scheduled for Friday, April 26th; they
will provide further information on this. On Saturday, April 27 th, they will
host Station Parties and on Sunday, April 28th the revenue service begins.
General Manager (GM) Phil Washington mentioned that in addition to all the
certifications and testing, the Government Relations team is working on
getting dignitaries invited to the grand opening. They will brief the Board as
they get more information.
Director Folska stated that they have done such a wonderful job and the
staff has showed incredible passion for the job. She asked about the
audible. Jim stated that they have completed the installation and will switch
over. Director Folska asked if those are the ones that have 45 decibels and
adjust to 90. Jim affirmed that was correct.
Director Folska asked if there is a blue line phone for emergencies. Dave
Genova responded that all parking structures and stations have emergency
phones. Director Folska asked if they have a “ping”. Dave responded they
do not. Director Folska asked if they can check if it is possible to have that
added. Dave stated that they have looked at it, but the option doesn’t seem
to exist. Director Folska asked if RTD could invent it, patent it and make it
available for other agencies.
Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs stated that
they have a Task Force that monitors the gate crossings. They will keep the

5.B

Task Force active to monitor if there are any changes that need to be made.
They will continue to assess if what they have is accurate. Director Folska
stated that she has talked to other transit agencies about this.

Director Daly asked about the light rail wrap. Jim stated that they will have
some additional safety messages. This is a new wrap totally dedicated to
safety. It is not sponsored; it is RTD safety messages.
Director Walker asked if there has been any feedback from the residents.
Jim stated that they just started with the testing. Although they are not in
service right now they have seen some questions come through.
Director Solano stated that the art needs to be done multicultural to show
the diversity on the community. Jim stated that there is a committee in
place that takes care of that.
Director Bagley thanked them for the presentation.

E. Other Matters
Director Anderson congratulated the elected members and stated that she looks
forward to working with them and understanding what specific issues they will

Director Folska also asked if they have thought of connecting the art
students to those stations. Jim stated that the Lamar station is being done
by the art school. Director Folska asked if they could look at getting other
elementary schools art programs to get involved. Jim stated that the art
they are looking for is from professionals. There are some kiosks that
change periodically and they might work for that purpose.

an amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract amount
$295,100.
Motion:

Director James made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the January 22nd, 2012 Board
meeting.

mapping services to the Farnsworth Group. He explained that
Farnsworth Group was originally selected in late 2009 and
have been providing these services for the past few years. Bill
Van Meter said that returning Board members may recall that
in addition to the boundary mapping, Farnsworth also provided
very strong service in the Board re-districting effort that was
performed in late 2011-2012.
He believes they have
performed these services well since they have been brought
under contact.

January 8, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting.

D. Other Matters
Director Tayer stated that as many of the Board members and staff is aware, he
was honored to get the appointment as the new Boulder Chamber of Commerce
President and CEO. He explained that this is a wonderful position and a great
opportunity to support his community in a different capacity but it is also a pretty
monumental undertaking. Director Tayer said that he was taking this opportunity
to give notice of his resignation from the RTD Board. He passed around a note to
the Board that is available in the Planning and Development agenda packet for
January 8, 2013. He said that it has been such an honor to serve the community
on this Board. He believes it is such a pleasure to work on such a critical issue for
our environment, economy and quality of life.
Director Tayer explained that he would be giving notice to the Boulder County
Commissioners so that they could begin their process to appoint a new Board
member. He stated that he will remain on the Board until an individual is selected.
General Manager Washington said that on behalf of the staff, the drivers and
mechanics, the service and cleaning, and the Senior Leadership Team, they want to
congratulate the incoming Board members on their swearing in; they also want to
congratulate the Board members that were selected as officers. He stated that
staff looks forward to working with this new Board as the governing body of RTD.

B. Recommended Actions

• Oracle Hardware and Software Contract Approval
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract (22DJ010) to DLT solutions LLC in the amount of
$2,020,472 for Oracle hardware, software and services.
Terry Howerter explained that this would be authorizing the General
Manager to enter into a contract with DLT solution for hardware, software
and services related to replacing some of our aging servers.
Trent Ratcliff stated that this contract was the outcome of 18 months of
comprehensive needs analysis and research on the technology architecture
that we needed and was sustainable for the future to meet our current and
future needs. He said that the infrastructure comes from the business unit
staff, IT staff and throughout RTD. This is a foundational set of hardware
and software that over the next 12 months will allow us to have a 5x
reduction in the number of servers that we maintain our critical business and
operations systems. Trent explained that we received two proposals and
this is being requested to be awarded to DLT Solutions as the most
responsible low bidder.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the January 22, 2013 Board
meeting.

Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Folska and Menten participated by telephone.

5.D

Director Tobiassen seconded the
motion.
Director Folska said that the $2 million for the hardware and
software seemed like a very low cost. She asked staff to
explain this low cost. She feels it would be a terrible mistake
to not budget enough to support proper implementation.
Trent Ratcliff explained that what we really are doing is
expanding on the infrastructure that we put into a trial
approximately a year and a half ago. RTD purchased two of
these database machines at that time and migrated most of
our critical applications onto those servers. He said that this
procurement is to purchase one additional database machine
and two engineered application servers. He states that the
original database machines exceeded staff expectations so
staff wants to move forward with more of the hardware and
software for operational and business efficiencies.
Director Lubow noted that the Board Report indicated this will
replace equipment that is five years old. She asked if the
expectation was that this new equipment would last for five
years as well. Trent Ratcliff stated that the hardware could
last for five or six years. He said that we can also expand the
hardware by 2x if we need to instead of replacing them;
Oracle will support these machines for many years if needed.
Director Lubow asked for the breakdown of cost between
hardware, software and maintenance. She also asked what
the expected expenses would be next year when we did not
need to purchase the hardware but needed to do another
contract for maintenance. Trent Ratcliff stated that he had
somewhat of a summary but not an exact breakdown. The
database hardware and enterprise database licensing which
includes compression of the data, high availability failover
capabilities and disaster recovery licenses costs in the
$340,000 range with $90,000 in maintenance. The
applications servers (2) cost $610,000 with approximately
$134,000 in maintenance. The various additional software for
different business applications is in the $600-$700 thousand
range with approximately $140,000 in maintenance. Trent
Ratcliff explained that maintenance would be 22% of the
original purchase price which includes patches, upgrades for
the hardware, and on-site issue support within four hours. He

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Discussion:

5.D

stated that the maintenance costs have been included in the
Strategic Budget Plan as well.

Director Lasater noted that with a maintenance cost of 22%
of the value over a five year period we are looking at on
overall maintenance cost of 110% of the value of the original
contract. He said that he is not familiar with this type of
environment but he feels the cost is high for a maintenance
contract. Trent Ratcliff explained this is not just a standard
server with processing; it has a storage array unit built in.
Trent stated that means we will not need to purchase an
additional $500 thousand dollar storage network appliance.
Trent said that while 22% may seem high it provides us 24/7
monitoring and alarming of the systems by Oracle customer
service and they do all the patches and upgrades on a
quarterly basis. This has allowed RTD to offload tremendous
growth in Database Administrator (DBA) Resources. Trent
explained that these servers will reduce our need for half of a
DBA, offsetting most of the maintenance cost.
Director Solano asked if this new acquisition would make the
Board Paperless Packet more secure. Trent Ratcliff explained
that the MinuteTraq system is hosted securely in the cloud by
our vendor so this would not have any impact on the Board
Paperless Packets.
Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater asked for the life expectancy of the hardware.
Trent Ratcliff said the hardware came out three years ago. He
explained that RTD’s refresh cycle is 5 years. If the hardware
is meeting our needs and we can get parts for it, then we can
keep the hardware for a sixth year. Trent stated that after a
sixth year we are taking a risk of potential hardware failures
that could be catastrophic.

C. Updates
Terry Howerter introduced Robert McNown from the CU Leeds School of
Business. He explained that RTD has contracted with CU Leeds to provide
sales and use tax forecasts that we use for short and long term projections
and forecast models. He informed the Board that we receive an update from
CU Leeds every quarter.
Robert McNown reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that
can be found in the January 15, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet. Robert informed the Board that the model is
grounded in well accepted economic relations. He stated that the CU Leeds
forecasts are not wildly different from other units doing similar exercises.
Robert McNown highlighted that recovery from the 2002 recession took
longer than 2009 recent recession. Colorado is making better progress in
terms of employment, wages, and State taxable retail sales. He stated that
the picture is one of steady, moderate growth but the economy at the
National and State level is still subject to some uncertainties.
Robert McNown stated that CU Leeds is predicting only a 1.23% revenue
increase in 2013 over 2012. This is attributed to data anomalies causing
high collections in January 2012, extremely robust consumer spending,
slower forecasted national and state economic growth, and Moody’s
forecasts of higher gas prices in 2013. He stated that he understands this is
not great news but CU Leeds wants to be realistic. He explained that most
of this sluggish growth will be happening in the first half of the year; by
2014 we will see growth exceeding 5% so we will be more on track with
our current moderately high rate of growth.
Robert McNown explained that they rely on the population forecasts from
the US Census and Colorado Office of Demography in their long term
forecasts. They analyze how the composition of the population will change
over time and apply their understanding of how spending patterns will
change with population composition changes. Robert stated that these
population forecasts are also subject to interim revision. The US Census just

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• CU Leeds Sales and Use Tax Forecast Update – No Backup

5.D

provided a revision in which the projection of the population in 2040 is 6%
lower than was projected 10 years ago.

Director Anderson asked if the retail sales collected by RTD outlined on Page
10 of the presentation included internet sales. Robert McNown stated that
it does include internet sales. He explained that when retail sales are
measured at the National level that would be comprehensive; by measuring
retail sales for the State, if there are out of state sales through the internet
they will not show up in the data. He stated that his team is trying to keep
their eye on internet sales. Brian Lewandowski provided an analysis of this
in CU Leeds full report of how this may effect projections going forward.
Committee Chair James asked Robert McNown if he had any comments on
whether or not anything would be done at the political level about collecting
tax on internet sales. Committee Chair James stated that he has not seen
much done on the issue. McNown said that they have seen in other states a
move to make more of the internet sales taxable. Some states have
extended their reach particularly if companies have a facility in the state that
gives the state some jurisdiction over internet sales but that is a very
contentious issue. Robert stated that as internet sales grow he anticipates
there will be some political forces on the part of groups like RTD that want
to capture more of the internet sales for their revenues and then there will
be countervailing pressures on the other side. He said that he is not in a
position to forecast how those political forces will work out either in the
internet sales context or the budget negotiations that are ahead of us.
McNown explained that is why CU Leeds provides us with the high and low
forecasts to take into account some of the uncertainties.
Director Bagley noted that in reading about gasoline prices locally versus
nationally, Colorado seems to be about 50 cents lower than the national
average. He asked if this could have a contributing factor to possibly
increasing our retail sales tax. McNown explained that the issue is not so
much the relative level of our gas prices compared to the Nation’s but what
the direction of change will be. He stated that even though our prices may
remain below the average they will still rise over 2013.
Director Bagley stated that he assumes all the CU Leeds forecasts were
based on RTD not collecting a tax on candy or soda. He said there could be
benefits that might come long later in the year or 2014 that we may not yet
know about. McNown explained that it would be possible if CU Leeds knew
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Robert McNown concluded by saying CU Leeds realizes their forecasts could
be too high or too low but the important thing is that the forecasts are
generated from theoretically sound economic relations and modeled with
state-of-the-art econometric procedures.

5.D

Director Bagley stated that in looking at the projections from December,
2011 RTD was significantly advantaged over what the projections were. He
asked if Robert McNown had anything to attribute that to. McNown said
this was in part from the data anomaly that lead to a postponement for
some collections from December, 2011 to 2012. He explained that CU
Leeds had no way of knowing about that; his team actually did not learn
about the anomaly until March through their conversations with staffers at
the Department of Revenue. Robert stated that a more important piece was
that Colorado and the District households were much more aggressive in
their spending behavior than CU Leeds would have expected.
Director Hoy stated that the population projections in the report were
negative numbers but that he believes this was pointing out that the
increase in the population was less than first anticipated. Robert McNown
said yes; the projections are about 6% lower than the Census Bureau was
reporting 10 years ago.
Director Tobiassen asked what the top three retail sales generators would
be. He also asked if retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have stores in the
District do they collect tax when selling something over the internet.
McNown said the top three retail sales generators are car sales, restaurants
and hotels, and clothing/department stores. Robert explained that retailers
in the District are required to collect tax on internet sales but he is not sure
if RTD get their tax. He believes they are required to collect for the state
but does not think RTD receives any of that collection. Terry Howerter
stated that the state uses the same basic data process for those taxes as inperson purchases to RTD would receive some of the tax collected.
Director Lubow said that scientists say we are in a situation of climate
change that could lead to water problems, less snowfall, etc. These
changes could factor into the economy. She asked if the CU Leeds team
took situations like these into account when generating their forecasts and if
it was even possible to take them into account. McNown stated that his
team did not factor anything with the climate into their forecasts. He
explained that their forecasts are much more conservative than other
forecasts he has seen because CU Leeds takes into account the
demographic drag. McNown said he is not sure how they would address
those situations but thinks it is worth giving some further thought to.
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that next year there would be a step up in the effective tax rate because of
a change in exemptions they could build that into the forecast. For example
in the model CU Leeds does have an effective tax rate that takes into
account that the vendor allowance has been phased back in. That changes
the effective rate of taxation in the same way changes some of the
exemptions would.

5.D

Committee Chair James thanked Robert McNown for his presentation.

• Web and Document Accessibility Briefing

Director Hoy asked how the scope of work for the RFP was developed; was
this done by internal employees or did we contact outside sources. He also
asked if this was phase one of the project. Trent Ratcliff stated that it was
written by internal employees but there is information available online and
they also consulted with local and national vendors as to what might be
included in the scope. Trent explained that we will have the vendor evaluate
our website and provide us with remediation. Once staff feels they have
remediated the website the vendor will conduct another assessment. Trent
stated that we can include more assessments by the vendor if needed.
Director Tobiassen said that when we originally began looking at this RFP
there was some discussion about having someone from the local disabilities
community involved in the evaluation. He also asked if he and Director
Folska could have a copy of the action plan when it becomes available.
Trent Ratcliff stated that was correct; Jim Pilkington with the Division of
Vocational Rehabilitation was on the panel.
Director Solano asked if the website would be accessible to our Spanish
speaking community. Trent Ratcliff explained that is not part of this
assessment but it is something marketing is looking into with the website
redesign.
Director Lubow asked if there was a process for the public to evaluate our
progress. Trent Ratcliff informed the Board that staff has been working with
the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the Colorado School for the Blind,
and several other organizations that make up an advisory panel. Trent
shared that he also reached out to a number of his peers in a consortium of
transit agencies in North America. He sent out 30 inquiries and only
received 4 responses as to what other agencies were doing in this area.
Director Malpiede asked how much the implementation was going to cost
RTD. Trent Ratcliff stated that the accessibility contract was $36 thousand
to have the two assessments. He explained that after the assessments it is
his hope that this company will be able to offer training for staff. Once staff
is trained all the work will be internal.

B. Recommended Actions

• Purchase of Up to 34 Mall Shuttle Buses
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to
exercise the option of Contract 19FK001 with DesignLine USA for the
purchase of up to 34, 45-foot mall shuttle buses to replace the existing
TransTeq mall buses at a price not to exceed $24,147,350.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
meeting on January 22, 2013.
Director Daly seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that in 2010 the Board approved the purchase of two
(2) DesignLine mall buses. The RFP included the option to
purchase 57 additional buses for a five year period with pricing
for additional buses being based on the initial base pricing plus
a price adjustment set by the US Department of Labor
Producer Price Index (PPI).
The mall buses are unique due to their length, number of
doors, low floors and demanding service. These units will
replace the existing TransTeq mall buses. TransTeq went out
of business and many of the components are obsolete and
there are no replacement parts and the buses are 12-13 years

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Folska and Menten participated by phone.

5.E

Director Lasater asked about the cost per bus. Lou Ha,
Manager of Technical Services, stated that the cost is
$735,000 per bus. Director Lasater asked for clarification on
the statement about purchasing 57 buses. Lou stated that the
RFP included the 57 additional buses, because at the time
staff did not know what the 18th Street circulator would
require. Bruce Abel mentioned that they are not anticipating
using the buses for the 18th Street circulator, and don’t
expect to use the full 57 bus option. The cost of the buses
takes into consideration the unique specifications RTD has for
the mall shuttle.
Director Malpiede asked if they are looking at air circulation
inside the buses, since during the summer months it can get
very hot inside the buses. Lou stated that they are negotiating
two changes; they will add fans to aid on the air circulation
and the skylight windows will be tinted so they don’t absorb
too much solar energy. Director Malpiede also asked if they
are looking at the rear wheel issue. Lou stated that due to
government regulation which requires a dual rear axle, there is
less space at the rear of the buses. Bruce Abel stated that
another modification they are negotiating is the movement of
the doors location; the manufacturer will move the middle door
to facilitate the boarding and will also work on the rear axle. It
will be more user friendly. Director Malpiede thanked them.
Director Daly asked if there is still an issue with the delivery by
DesignLine. Lou stated that the original two vehicles were
prototypes, and because they were still working with the
manufacturer on the design, they had some delays; however
they don’t expect delays in the future. Director Daly asked
what the delivery timeline is for the new buses. Lou stated
that the forecast is one year from notice to proceed. Director
Daly asked what kind of engine the buses will have. Lou
stated that they will have micro turbine engine similar to the
ones on planes, but in a smaller scale. This will generate the
energy to charge the battery and provide electricity to drive
the vehicle. It is a hybrid and will run on battery half of the
time and the other half will run with help of the turbine engine.

old. Staff has asked for feedback from users and operators
and they have decided to move ahead with the purchase if
approved by the Board.

Director Hoy asked what the capacity of the new buses is
versus the current fleet. Bruce Abel stated that the current
vehicles allow 150 passengers and the new buses capacity is
100. Director Hoy asked if this will require making
adjustments on the service. Bruce Abel mentioned that since
the mall shuttle will work with the 18th circulator, the staff
will evaluate the need for more vehicles and service changes
once the circulator opens. Director Hoy stated that cost to
maintain the current fleet should be higher than the cost of
purchasing new buses. Bruce Abel stated that because the
manufacturer of the current fleet went out of business, some
parts are not available anymore.
Director Walker asked if they will look at reducing the number
of trips of the mall shuttle. Bruce Abel stated that they will
review the impact once they open the 18th circulator. He also
stated that they have budget for 32 buses and they are
currently negotiating the adjustments which might allow
purchasing an additional bus.
Director Solano asked for the location of DesignLine. Lou
stated that they are located in North Carolina.
Director Folska asked who pays for the mall shuttle operation.
Bruce Abel stated that RTD pays for the operation of the mall
shuttle service while some local businesses pay for the mall
maintenance. Director Folska asked if there are any other
agencies that could share in the cost of the buses, or if there
is a model that we can look at for the operation of the shuttle
and circulators. Director Tobiassen asked to take that
discussion offline as it is not part of the agenda.
Director Tobiassen asked if the current fleet is running on
biodiesel. Lou stated that in the last few years the
government has reduced the diesel exhaust emission which is
now very similar to CMG emissions.
Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• April 2013 Service Change

Motion:

Director Daly made the motion to
move this item to the full Board
meeting on January 22, 2013.
Director Walker seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel introduced Jesse Carter, Bus Operations Manager,
who stated that due to the completion of the West Light Rail
and adoption of the West Corridor Service Plan, some changes
in bus and light service are slated to begin on April 28, 2013.
Additional routine service changes not associated with the
West Corridor Service Plan are also necessary to maintain
system on-time performance. They will continue to focus on
adjusting services in response to the January 2012 service
revision and changes in ridership and operational performance.
The service changes that will take place in April 2013 reflect
the continued budgetary challenges faced by RTD while
continuing to observe the guiding principles for service
changes such as service performance evaluation based on
RTD’s Service Standards; effects on the overall integrity of the
transit network and transit dependent markets; availability of
alternative services to affected riders; cost-effective
distribution throughout the district and family services; Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act and response to changes in the
communities where services are provided.
Bruce stated that they will use the passenger alert system to
send messages to the users of the three routes impacted.

Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve moving the proposed April 2013 Service Change
on to public review and comment.

5.E

Director Lubow stated that constituents do not like service
changes especially if service is reduced. She asked if when
changes are needed, the staff can provide something in
writing as why the changes are made. Jesse stated that
usually they create a brochure for the public and they have
open lines for public feedback and questions. Bruce Abel
stated that typically they bring a full report to the Board
detailing the proposed changes and why they are being
proposed. That Board Report is then translated into
pamphlets, brochures and signs for buses and light rail.
Depending on the severity of the changes they hold very small
or large meetings. Director Lubow stated that she would like
to see a package before it is approved. Bruce Abel stated that
the usual process is to go to the stakeholders first, then the
staff comes to the Board with the proposed changes and asks
for authorization to go out to the public for feedback. Once
public outreach has been done they come back to the Board
with that feedback and amended recommendations.
Director Deadwyler stated that it seems no matter what we do
in terms of public hearings, participation is very low. She
asked what else we can do to get the information out. She
mentioned that she has received complaints from her
constituents when they have not heard about the changes.
The two step process we have in place does not seem to be
working. Bruce Abel stated that no matter how much they
reach out, they always get complaints once the changes take
place. They are always trying to find new ways to
communicate. Jesse stated that they went to the business
community and neighborhood associations and that seemed to
have yielded higher participation.
Director Daly followed up to Director Lubow’s question and
stated that the staff usually provides a very detailed package.
Director Solano asked if they are looking at the Spanish
speaking demographic for those outreaches. Jesse stated that
they have to do a Title VI review on any major changes and
English language proficiency (ELP) is part of that evaluation.
They also look at how to put together the document and if
they need translation.
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 15, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tayer asked what changes would be occurring to the
Skip route. Jesse stated that they will have the bus out a
little bit later.

5.E

Director Folska asked what the impact is in the area of
passenger with disabilities. Bruce Abel stated that there is no
ADA impact as a result of these changes.
Director Tobiassen mentioned that he has had good feedback
on the alerts systems and he likes the idea of using the system
for public outreach.

C. Updates

• Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Bruce Abel introduced Eric Farrington, Project Manager, who is in charge of
the project. Eric stated that the report is in the packet and asked for any
questions.
Director Daly congratulated the staff for not having red in the report. Eric
stated they adjusted the delivery date; that way they will only get red when
issues are really falling behind.

• Smart Card Project Status Update
Bruce stated that the Smart Media fare collection system went live on
January 1 for the ECO and College pass customers. Employees serving as
“ambassadors” staffed RTD light rail platforms from December 27, 2012
until January 11, 2013 with some area colleges’ platforms staffed until
January 21, 2013.
Director Tayer congratulated the staff. He stated that this is a change and a
challenge but he complimented the staff for the way they handled the
customer service part of this project.
Director Deadwyler also congratulated them and thanked them for
responding to the issues and keeping her informed so she could get back to
her constituents on a timely basis.

Election of 2013 Board Officers
Chair Pro Tem Tayer explained that this is the Board’s annual opportunity to elect
the leadership of the RTD Board. He stated that this is very important in terms of
how the meetings are run.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer reviewed the process of nominating and voting on a candidate
with the Board. The positions up for appointment are Chair, First Vice Chair,
Second Vice Chair, Secretary and Treasurer. The first step is to ask for
nominations from the Board for the position and then Chair Pro Tem Tayer will then
ask for a second for each of those positions. When it appears there are no more
nominations he will close the nominations. Each Board member who made the
nomination will be allowed to speak for three minutes and the nominated Board

Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 8, 2013 7:30 PM (Approval of Special Board Meeting Minutes of January 8, 2013)

7.1

member will be allowed to speak for three minutes. The Board members will be
given a secret ballot to vote and those will be tallied by two Board members
appointed by Chair Pro Tem Tayer. RTD’s Deputy General Counsel Rolf Asphaug
will work with the two Board members to tally the votes.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer explained that in order for a candidate to be elected they must
have eight affirmative votes. If there is a round of voting in which no candidate
has eight affirmative votes, the voting process will be repeated. Chair Pro Tem
Tayer said he will ask each nominee if they wish to continue in the process and the
floor will be opened for additional nominations. If there are additional nominations
the Board member who made the nomination will be allowed to speak for three
minutes and the nominated Board member will be allowed to speak for three
minutes. The voting process will be conducted again and this process will continue
until a nominee receives eight affirmative votes.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer asked the Board if this was an acceptable process. Director
Anderson expressed that parliamentary procedures do not allow for additional
nominees after the nominations are been closed for the first time. Chair Pro Tem
Tayer asked if this was acceptable to the rest of the Board and the Board was in
agreement. Rolf Asphaug confirmed that this was in compliance with Robert’s
Rules.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer began by entertaining a motion for the Chair of the Board.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to nominate Director
Folska to the position of Chair of the Board for 2013.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Tobiassen extended a warm welcome to the newly
installed Board members for the first Board meeting of the
New Year. Director Tobiassen stated that for the past five
years the Board has been Chaired by a phenomenal person,
Lee Kemp. He believes that Chair Kemp went above and
beyond the call of duty, making himself available five days a
week. In Director Tobiassen’s opinion he really raised the bar
for the Chair position. He believes the bar was set so high
that the Board expects someone to sacrifice as Chair Kemp
did. He stated that Board members are all equally elected by
their constituents to represent their interests in the Board of
Directors and all have one vote. He believes that all Board

Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 8, 2013 7:30 PM (Approval of Special Board Meeting Minutes of January 8, 2013)

7.1

members are equally eligible to fill this position. There are no
rules, qualifications, time in service, experience, leadership
qualities or IQ that have been laid out in State statute or Board
rules as to who can be elected as Chair. Director Tobiassen
explained that he makes his decision on who he will choose
based on criteria that is important to him: passion, intelligence,
integrity and experience. He stated that most importantly he
is looking for someone that will really work to build strong
relationships through a careful listening, patient and caring
process. He believes observing how one responds under
pressure or how they respect the varying and diverse opinions
of other members of the Board are very telling signs of how
they might lead. He explained that for these reasons he is
nominating Director Folska. He believes she has proven
herself time and again in many of the qualities that are
important to Director Tobiassen. Her passion for public
transportation though her involvement in working to make
RTD the best it can be is very important. Director Tobiassen
also believes that Director Folska’s election to Chair will send
a very strong message to our constituents that the RTD Board
has the vision and guts to elected a transit dependent Chair
from the disabled community. He feels that race and gender
do matter to our constituents but he also believes that
disability matters.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to nominate Director
Anderson to the position of Chair of the Board for 2013.
Director James seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley expressed his appreciation to the Board for
their time. He stated that he has known of Lorraine’s
background for some time because of his strong and longtime
relationship with the former Mayor of Littleton, his hometown,
but he did not know her personally until after her election in
November of 2010. He said that shortly after the election he
asked to meet with Lorraine to discuss RTD and FasTracks.
Lorraine was more than happy to give him the tour of
Downtown Arvada. He was interested in her perspective of

Lorraine shared about her and Arvada’s involvement in the
completion of the Gold Line. This meeting and subsequent
meetings have revealed that Director Anderson’s involvement
and support in the completion of the Gold Line have really
been critical. Director Bagley stated that the issues that relate
mostly to the Gold Line are her specific support of Transit
Oriented Development and enhanced attention to looking at
transit parking in Arvada a different way. Director Bagley
believes this shows a tremendous background and reservoir of
knowledge on Director Anderson’s part. He feels this can be
transferred to other corridors. Director Bagley shares that he
is astounded at Director Anderson’s accomplishments at the
municipal level and as a small business entrepreneur. She has
a background of working with local governments to come up
with win-win solutions to complex problems. He believes her
efforts as a former member and Chair of the Denver Regional
Council of Governments and as a member of the Colorado
Municipal League demonstrate her ability to work
collaboratively with others and get issues resolved in a
nonpartisan manner. Director Anderson’s vision for the future
of RTD is consistent with what needs to be demonstrated by
the RTD Board. He stated that this includes the necessity on
the part of the agency to be held as a trusted partner by all of
our stakeholders. This includes the Federal Government, the
State Government, the State Legislators, Metro Mayors,
significant contractors such as Kiewitt, and the public.
Director Bagley feels that her 24 year background in municipal
governance is a significant demonstration of this grass roots
citizen perspective. Director Bagley stated that 2013 will be a
significant year for RTD and having a Chair with the previous
demonstrated qualities of cooperation, collaboration and trust
as all level would be paramount in the agency’s continued
delivery of transportation mobility option.

neighborhood groups, grant writing, and land-use planning to
having a critical eye on the policies that the Board sets forth.

vulnerable constituents. Director Malpiede has worked to

be an excellent Chair to lead through consensus and
consensus building to complete FasTracks by the year 2020.
She understands that RTD has focused on a lot of different
communities, particularly those that are most vulnerable. She
believes one of the gold standards for RTD is the blind model.
If RTD can create transportation systems that provide
accessible transportation to people who are blind or otherwise
disabled then anyone can use them. She said she is very
excited to be here and looks forward to working with everyone
collaboratively. Director Folska stated that voting for her will
take a lot of courage and vision but she believes she will be a
good Chair.

to the community that she was going to serve to ask them

every facet of our community. Director Malpiede said that she
has worked with the Stapleton Foundation for the last 12

methodologies. Director Malpiede has served as the

the community and as the Chair she would represent a broad
perspective.
Director Anderson stated that she is a native of North Denver.
She said that she has spent over 24 years working as a grass
roots citizen in Arvada. She served on the Arvada City
Council for 24 years. She explained that one of the major
interests in Arvada was to have rail transit serve the city. The
City Council worked to make the City transit friendly by
changing the zoning codes early on to allow for higher density.
Director Anderson said if there is one thing people do not like
more than sprawl it is density. She said that it was not an
easy job to get the City transit friendly. Director Anderson
stated that she worked with Susan Thornton on the
Southwest Corridor and Bert Melcher on many transportation
projects through DRCOG. Director Anderson stated that she
knows transportation in the Denver Metro Area. She stated
that she has also served on the State Transportation Advisory
Board for CDOT. Director Anderson said that she understands
Chair Kemp left big shoes to fill but he also set an example of
a person who had experience, compassion and knowledge.

funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and added to a new
budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The status of the FISA
will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will be
incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures
from the FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals
identified below in the Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD
Board project goals for the FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations
at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;
2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction
milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has
been received and RTD has better information on the growth of sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to
two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation –
complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of
2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide
RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are
the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number
one legislative priority. Begin working immediately with government relations staff,
lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to initiate and support the
introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.
Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks
capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300
million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could
fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017. The Board directs staff to

MOTION:

Director McMullen made the
motion to item K, Moving
Forward: Filling the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

DISCUSSION:

Director McMullen stated how pleased he was to move the
motion that will get FasTracks done sooner than later. This is
a sound plan and he hopes for unanimous consent.
Director O’Boyle stated he will support this action for the good
of the whole organization.
Director Bagley stated he will support this motion. He has had
discussions with the staff and is pleased with the staff
response in relation to item 4 of this proposal, defer
Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad
relocation. He looks forward to the communications to the
Southwest Corridor on the plans.
Director Cohen states he enthusiastically support this
proposal. When he first came to the Board his first action was
an approval of approximately $8M item. How pleased he is to
be leaving having approved a $300M action item which is
moving FasTracks in the right direction. He thanked Phil and
the staff for their confidence in the Board to make the right
decision.
Director Gore also stated he supported this plan. When he
came on the Board five months ago, things for the north
looked dismal. He is amazed that in this short time, staff has
come up with a proposal for generating $277M which can
move the north forward. He applauded the General Manager
and staff for their fortitude and diligence in listening to the
voice of the people.

continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the RAM analysis process
in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.

Director Deadwyler stated that while this appears to be a good
proposal, she remains concerned over the lack of a sunset or
policy for rubber tires. Therefore she will vote no for this
action item.
Director Hoy stated he is very enthusiastic about this. He
feels this is a good step for the north and has now put people
on speaking terms and willingness to re-engage.
Director Daly stated he was enthusiastic about this proposal.
This is a risk that is realistic.
Director Tayer expressed that he will support this proposal
with the understanding that this program will not prioritize
corridors who contribute over the 2.5% above the corridors
that do not; and that cuts or changes to rubber tire services
will not preclude BRT service.
Chair Kemp stated this has been a long time coming. We
must follow the money. Getting the North line is essential to
moving forward.

Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims with
Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the General Manager
or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one
agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”)
project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another
agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned
Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”). The Bridge
Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable,
and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in
an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount
from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it
through termination of the Bridge Easement. RTD would receive $10,000,000 from
Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the
Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of $9,163,580 to RTD, which
would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished
out of the $10,000,000 to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline
Easement.

Subject:

Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option
- Farnsworth Group

Van

Meter,

Assistant

Date: January 3, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 22, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a one year
contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing contract through 2013 in an
amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract amount $295,100.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Farnsworth Group in late 2009 following a competitive bid of 5 submitted
proposals. Farnsworth provides RTD with boundary mapping services. These services include tracking
annexations by jurisdictions along the District’s boundaries, and the corresponding changes to the
respective Director Districts, as well as ensuring RTD is up to date with the appropriate precinct rolls by
county for each Director District.
The contract included five option years; this requested action would be to exercise the third year option.
The Contract Not-To-Exceed amount for 2013 is $68,900.
DISCUSSION
The contract support is critical to RTD so that staff is able to maintain an accurate, up-to-date boundary
map that allows RTD to determine which residents and businesses are in or out of the District thereby
maximizing RTD’s sales tax collections. Also, the boundary map is used to determine who is eligible for
in-District parking privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates. Additionally,
counties within the District often modify precinct boundaries. It is imperative for RTD to have the most
up-to-date precinct boundaries whenever a general or special election is required so that RTD can certify
the precinct list for the respective Director District.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District to exercise the option from Farnsworth Group is for an amount not to exceed
$68,900. Sufficient funding has been included in the 2013 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to exercise a one year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the
existing contract through 2013 in an amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract
amount $295,100.
2. Do not approve the option to extend the contract with Farnsworth Group.

This action is not

RTD will not be able to determine when annexations have occurred by local jurisdictions along
the District boundary and will thereby lose sales taxes generated in newly annexed areas; and
RTD will not be able to accurately determine who is eligible for in-District parking privileges
and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates; and
RTD will not have an accurate list of County precincts and will not be able to certify precinct
lists for Director Districts for regularly scheduled or special elections thereby compromising
the election process.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a contract (22DJ010) to DLT solutions
LLC in the amount of $2,020,472 for Oracle hardware, software and services.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s current core server and data storage infrastructure reached its end of useful life of 5 years in early 2012. This
procurement is part of a 5 year IT strategic plan included in the 2012 and 2013 strategic budget plan (SBP).
To meet operational requirements of the many new systems, RTD’s business applications have increasingly required
more processing and storage capacity, higher availability and recovery capabilities.
With this foundational hardware and software, over the next 12 months, the Information Technology team will be able
to consolidate over 30 servers into just 6 servers, increase system and application performance by over 600% and
provide critical system failover and disaster recovery.
RTD currently runs all critical business and operational systems using Oracle hardware and software. Below is a list,
although not all inclusive, of the services impacted by this procurement:
1. RTD’s finance, accounts receivable/payable, payroll and budgeting
2. Human resources employee management, benefits and recruiting
3. Purchase requisition, procurement, contracts and RTD’s inventory and warehousing
4. State of Good Repair (SoGR)
5. Rail and bus maintenance and work order system, operator management system
6. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) such as Trip Planner, Farebox, Smartcard, CAD/AVL, passenger

5. Improve new software release quality assurance (QA) testing
6. Dramatically improve system performance and reliability
7. Provide the required hardware and software licensing infrastructure for continuation of operations disaster
recovery site located at the State of Colorado disaster recovery site (eFort)
The scope of this procurement includes the following:
 One additional engineered Oracle database server and storage (Exadata) plus required database licenses and 1
year of maintenance.
 Two engineered application servers and storage (Exalogic) plus required licenses and 1 year of maintenance.
 Foundation software licenses plus maintenance for real time passenger information systems.
 Foundation software licenses plus maintenance for an enterprise data warehouse.
 Software licenses plus maintenance for advanced reporting and business intelligence.
 Software licenses plus maintenance to provide business operations efficiency such as automating the purchase

o Expert assessments and recommendations, incorporating best practices throughout the deployment and
asset lifecycle from Oracle advanced support engineers.
o Installation and configuration services for all hardware and associated software.
o Proactive quarterly patch and upgrade services for all hardware and software throughout the lifecycle of
assets.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District for this long term foundational hardware and software is $2,020,472. Funding has been
appropriated in the 2013 IT operational expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
Approve the request to replace legacy hardware and associated software licensing and continue to:
 Create operational efficiencies throughout the District
 Provide new services to our riders and constituents such as real time passenger information and automatic stop
announcements

Board Meeting Date: January 22, 2013

Subject:

Purchase of Up to 34 Mall Shuttle Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 19FK001 with
DesignLine USA for the purchase of up to 34, 45-foot mall shuttle buses to replace the existing
TransTeq mall buses at a price not to exceed $24,147,350.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the purchase of two (2) DesignLine mall buses on March 23, 2010
to accommodate the changes to the operation of the Free Mall Ride Shuttle resulting from the
construction and reconfiguration of the Denver Union Station. The original procurement was the result of
RTD Request for Proposals (RFP), for which proposals were received on September 10, 2009.
DesignLine was determined the most responsive and responsible proposer. The RFP allowed RTD to
purchase up to 57 additional buses for a five year period with pricing for additional buses being based on
the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment set by the US Department of Labor Producer Price Index
(PPI).
The mall buses are unique because of their length, number of doors, completely low floor and highly
demanding service. Industry standard bus manufacturers do not produce the mall bus type and do not
want to expend their resources in the engineering and manufacture of the buses because of their low
sales volume. Currently, there may be only two specialty bus manufacturers that are interested in the
production of these buses.
The new DesignLine buses will replace the existing TransTeq mall buses. The TransTeq mall buses are
currently 12 to 13 years old. By the time the new buses arrive, the current mall buses will be more than
13 and 14 years old. The bus manufacturer, TransTeq, went out of business several years ago. Many
components of the buses have become obsolete and there are no replacement parts. The lack of support
and replacement parts have caused extreme difficulty in keeping the buses in service.
DISCUSSION
The DesignLine mall buses are low floor buses, 45’ long with three wide passenger doors for fast and
easy passenger ingress and egress. The buses are powered by a hybrid electric system driven by a
micro-turbine engine. When the batteries are fully charged, the engine shuts down and the bus runs on
full electric mode. In normal operation, the buses operate in full electric mode about half of the time. To
comply with ADA, the buses have a wheel chair ramp and two wheelchair tiedown positions.
The first two DesignLine mall buses, Bus #1640 and #1641, were received and put into service in
November 2011 and April 2012, respectively. The buses have received positive acceptance from the
riding public and the Denver Downtown Partnership. The Partnership has endorsed the purchase of
additional DesignLine buses for the replacement of the existing buses. Passengers have given the buses
mostly positive reception. In term of mechanical performance, the buses have performed better and
more reliably in initial service than the previous two generations of mall buses. With the knowledge from

Packet Pg. 80

11.C

the bus evaluation service, we are including a number of improvements to the buses in the manufacture
of additional buses to allow better maintenance service accessibility and passenger comfort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the change order to exercise the purchase option for a guaranteed quantity
of 32 mall shuttle buses in the amount not to exceed $24,147,350. The quantity may be increased up
to 34 buses depending on the final price negotiation with DesignLine. The purchase is funded partially in
the amount of $6,500,000 by the State of Good Repair Grant from the Federal Government. The
remaining funding is in the District’s 2013 Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, DesignLine has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a change order to DesignLine for the purchase of thirtytwo (32) additional mall buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the change order and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Board Meeting Date: January 22, 2013

Subject:

April 2013 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
moving the proposed April 2013 Service Change on to public review and comment.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of construction of the West Light Rail Line and Board adoption of the West Corridor
Service Plan on October 23, 2012, significant changes in bus and light service are slated to begin April
28, 2013. Additional routine service changes not associated with or included in the West Corridor
Service Plan are also necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate
level of service according to customer demand. For this year we will continue to focus on adjusting
services in response to the January 2012 service revisions and changes in ridership and operational
performance.
The proposed April 2013 Service Changes contained herein reflect the continued budgetary challenges
faced by RTD. The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
•
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
•
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
•
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
•
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services
•
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin
•
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Routine Service Adjustments

designed to inform the public of the proposed service changes and to obtain public input which will be
summarized and reported to the Board at its February meeting, when final service change proposals will
