## IX. Chair's Report

The newly installed Board Chair Anderson congratulated the nine Directors who had been re-elected or elected.  She noted that the five new members had undergone a rigorous orientation process.   She is pleased with the diversity on the Board which represents the makeup of our District.  She had watched the celebration of the Martin Luther King Anniversary and also the second inauguration of our President Obama.  She was impressed with the significance of this event and Obama’s words that all people need to be treated with respect and dignity. She had appointed Directors Deadwyler and Malpiede as co-chairs of the Civil Rights Committee with hopes that they can help elevate civil rights not only at RTD but also in this metropolitan region.  She had also appointed Director Tobiassen to this committee because of his passion to help the disabled.  She is looking forward to the Board teambuilding session and she is impressed with the civility of the Board in their interface with the community, staff, stakeholders and each other.  She hopes that we will continue to treat others with respect and dignity.

## X. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington indicated that he and a couple of his senior leadership members participated in the Transit Research Board conference January 15-17.  He indicated this was a prestigious group of academians and scientists with over 11,700 in participation.  They were interested in RTD and he and his team were able to share.

- General Manager Washington participated in the “Planting the Seed Conference” which took place at Montbello High School.  This event was in conjunction with the Martin Luther King celebration and creating sustainable communities.

- General Manager Washington thanked the Board for their approval of the RAM matrix which provided eight initiatives that staff will pursue for funding sources for FasTracks. He introduced a new initiative to the Board members for the North Metro initiative which offered three financial market opportunities in the next 6-8 months:

o        Refinancing three RTD debt issues as lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash flows and provide additional capacity under TABOR

o        Issuing the bridge financing debt for the Eagle project to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) at a lower interest rate than assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR

o        Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd segment

General Manager Washington staff will be bringing this item before the Board in February and ask permission to do an RFP.  Questions from Board members included:

- Is this amount over and above the projected $277M from the initial 8 initiatives on the RAM?  General Manager Washington responded yes.

- When does construction start?  Prior to the release of the RFP.

- The CFO had referenced 3 debts-what is included?  Issuance of new debt, finish up of final design and construct to 72nd Avenue.  CFO Howerter indicated this was a good plan.  This will be a request to refinance; it will free up TABOR capacity and this can be done smoothly.

General Manager Washington added that the DUS to 72nd leg is the most expensive and difficult to construct.  We will save money in the long run.

- Director Bagley inquired about the refinancing and difference in basic interest rates.  CFO Howerter responded that the 2006 FasTracks refinancing would result in approximately $70M of interest savings. He anticipates refunding of these bond issues of $236M;$99M and $37M.

- Director Lasater asked about the cost and requested a cost per mile comparative analysis with the East, West and SW corridor lines.

- Director James asked what was the percent of the overall debt.  CFO Howerter indicated about 10%.  He also asked what was the difference with this line.  General Manager Washington indicated we have benefited from the lessons learned that we had done.  This line will be a design-build-build.  Rick Clarke added that when working with multiple jurisdictions, it becomes challenging to work out the technical changes and community issues.

- Director Folska complimented the staff on working with the TRB and asked if the extra cost to go to 72nd has to do with dealing with more existing infrastructure.  General Manager Washington indicated this is a big part of it especially when you think of something like utility relocations, but there are just a number of technical challenges.

- Director Hoy asked about the potential for accelerating and the response from the stakeholders such as Denver and Adams Counties.  General Manager Washington indicated they are aware of this and are supportive.  RTD will be asking them to sign off before the release of the RFP.  We need to finalize the IGA’s and hope they will be supportive.

- Director Lubow thanked the staff for their creative ideas and movement for up north.

- Tobiassen also thanked staff for the out of the box thinking and asked if having the RFP on the street for 30 days is sufficient.  General Manager Washington indicated a draft RFP will be out this summer.

- Director Walker asked if there is a window where construction could start and stop.  General Manager Washington indicated we will not piecemill this solution.

- Director Folska inquired about the interplay between the Northwest Mobility Study and the North Metro Initiative.  General Manager Washington indicated there is not much interplay.

- CFO Howerter added that on the $236M, the face amount of the bonds was at 4.375 to 5%; the replacement bonds will be at or below 3%.

### A. Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option - Farnsworth Group

### B. Oracle Hardware and Software Contract Approval

### D. 2013 - 001 : Appointment of Trustees to the Rtd Pension Trust and Defined Contribution Plan

##### a. 2013 Resolution - 001 Appointment of the Trustees to the RTD Pension Trust and Defined Contributions Plan

### E. April 2013 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve moving the proposed April 2013 Service Change on to public review and comment.

### F. Purchase of Up to 34 Mall Shuttle Buses

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 19FK001 with DesignLine USA for the purchase of up to 34, 45-foot mall shuttle buses to replace the existing TransTeq mall buses at a price not to exceed $24,147,350.

Chair Anderson asked for a motion to approve item C, Purchase of up to 34 mall shuttle buses that had been pulled from the unanimous consent.

Motion:              Director James made the motion to approve the purchase of up to 34 mall shuttle buses.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Subsidiary

Motion:              Director Menten asked to postpone this action until November after New Jersey has had a chance to test their similar product and allow more time for Board review.

Director Solano seconded this motion.

Discussion:              Director Menten passed out handouts from research she had done on the design-line bus.  Her research indicated concerns with quality, financial stability of the vendor and the fact that two other transit agencies had a bad experience with this vendor.  She also raised issues pertaining to why DreamLine was selected over a Colorado company.

Director Lubow expressed concern and asked if staff was aware of these legal and technical issues with DreamLine and the product.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations and Dean Shaklee, superintendent of maintenance, responded to these questions and allegations.  RTD is very aware of these issues and the problem has been correctly.  We have currently had 2 prototype design- line vehicles on the mall and have experienced no problems.  In fact, this vehicle has proven more reliable than other prototypes.  RTD has done our due diligence on this product.  The type of product being used in New Jersey is an over-the-road model and is different from the mall shuttle model that we are purchasing.  AGM Abel also indicated that when we had issued RFP for the busses, our finance department had reviewed the financial records of the vendor.  RTD has had a positive experience with the vendor on the two prototypes in use and has noticed a decrease in cost per mile.  We have negotiated several modifications to the buses and the vendor has been responsive.

Director Solano inquired about the battery fires and how does this differ.  Dean Shaklee indicated this is the same type battery just as what is used in a number of different devices and applications.  The issue of fire was in the overcharging of the batteries.  Dean also noted that the transit manufacturer for our current buses is no longer in business and the propulsion system is obsolete.  The current buses are over 12 years, have exceeded their useful life and parts are not available.  The RTD maintenance shop is performing their own maintenance and has “created” parts on which to operate.  Very soon they will be unable to do this. Bruce Abel indicated that before the complete purchase would be made, after the initial bus, it will be run through strenuous testing at the Altunna plant.  Dean Shaklee indicated that the Altunna testing is required by the FTA.

Director Lubow stated there are several red flags about this company.  They have a pretty bad track record and she does not feel RTD did due diligence in not sharing this information with them.  Bruce Abel indicated that much of this had already been discussed prior to the new Board members coming on board and apologized for not providing this information.

Director Lasater echoed the concern that this information was not shared and asked when did TransTech (maker of current buses) go down.  Dean Shaklee responded about 18 months ago.  RTD acquired all the inventory that we could.

Director Solano wanted to know how extensive was our inventory and did we have enough inventory to maintain the buses.  Dean Shaklee responded not really and we are already out of some parts.

Bruce Abel re-stated these vehicles have exceeded the recommended state of good repair and we need to plan accordingly.

Director Folska inquired if the bidder from outside of US met requirements for Buy America.  She also asked if we execute a contract, how long before the vehicle will be on the street.  Dean Shaklee responded the vehicle would go through the Altunna testing in May or June and delivery could be late this year or early next year.

Director Lubow stressed a potential liability with this new bus and asked if it was possible to order only a few.  AGM Abel indicated the cost was determined by the CPI index and an increase in the CPI will drive an increase in the cost.

Vote on Subsidiary

Motion

(To Postpone):              The amendment failed with 2 in favor (Menten and Solano) and 12 against (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Deadwyler, Folska, Hoy, Lasater, James, Lubow, Rivera-Malpiede, Tobiassen, and Walker)

Chair Anderson declared the amendment FAILED and called for a vote on the primary motion.

Chair Anderson declared the Motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 19FK001 with DesignLine USA for the purchase of up to 34, 45-foot mall shuttle buses to replace the existing TransTeq mall buses at a price not to exceed $24,147,350.

### G. FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors reappoint six members of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to an additional three-year term and appoint one new member to the Committee to the remainder of a three-year term to fill a vacancy.

Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to approve the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Scott Reed spoke to the diversity of this Committee.  He indicated there were 17 members and that 14 of the 15 districts are represented.

Director Folska stated she appreciates the work of this committee and understand that their efforts only apply to FasTracks.

Director Lubow stated that the appointees all seem to have wonderful qualifications with advanced degrees.  She asked if we look at the socioeconomic diversity for the committee as she does not think the CAC members are representative of the ridership.  Director Solano added there should be a look at the blue collar workers.

Director Bagley shared that he and Sherman Hamilton were a part of the selection committee.  They had 60 applicants that had been narrowed down to 9 candidates.  Two of them were a no-show.  All of them had significant presence in the community, did an outstanding job, and were from high level functioning groups.

Director Anderson indicated that at the planning advance (retreat) we could look at ideas on how to get the local communities involved.

Vote on

Motion:              The motion passed with 12 votes in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Deadwyler, Folska, Hoy, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Rivera-Malpiede, Tobiassen and Walker) and 1 against (Solano).  Director James had left early and Director Tayer was absent.

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.
