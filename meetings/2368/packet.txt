1.B.1.a

DRAFT POLICY FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION OF EXCESS PROPERTY:
I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. During the course of
implementing the regional transit system, the District has acquired and will in the future
acquire various real property interests for transit related uses. As the District’s needs change
over time, real property once needed for transit purposes may no longer be needed and may
be disposed of, or may be utilized more efficiently and effectively if combined with transit
supportive uses in a joint development project. This policy replaces prior District policies on
disposition and joint development, including Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and Resolution 35,
Series of 2002, and identifies procedures for authorizing the disposition of excess real property,
or the joint development of District real property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has no current or future transit
interest.
3. Fair Market Value: The amount at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
4. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project
costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
5. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.

1.B.1.b

6. Project Property: Any real property or improvements included in the costs of an FTAassisted project, or as otherwise provided under current Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) guidance.1
7. Permanent Real Property Interest: Fee simple, long-term leasehold of fifty years or
more in duration, or inclusion in a condominium or common interest community.
III. Policy:
1. District Initiated Dispositions or Joint Development:
The following procedures apply when the District initiates a disposition or joint
development of real property.
a. The General Manager and CEO (“GM”) shall review existing Management
Directives, and establish additional administrative processes and procedures as
necessary to plan for the disposition or joint development of District property,
and to secure FTA concurrence for real property matters, where applicable. The
processes and procedures shall define how fair market value is determined. All
property dispositions and/or joint developments shall require Board approval
unless the disposition or joint development meets the delegation of authority
criteria defined below.

b. If the excess real property or the property to be included in a joint development
is configured in a way that it cannot be developed as a stand-alone development
(eg: size, access, etc), and there is a single contiguous property owner with an
interest in acquiring the District property, the District may elect to negotiate
directly with that contiguous property owner.

c. All other joint development and disposition that is initiated by the District shall
be competitively advertised.

2. Unsolicited Proposals for acquisition or joint development of District Property:
The following applies when the District receives a proposal for joint development or a
purchase offer for excess property.
a. External solicitations to acquire excess District property or to enter into a joint
development of District Property shall follow the procedures outlined in the
Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property.
3. Delegation of Authority:
a. Any grant of a permanent real property interest by the District shall be approved
by the RTD Board of Directors, provided, however, that the Board delegates
authority to the GM/CEO to grant the following types of property interests:
i. All access and utility easements across and benefitting RTD property;
ii. Dedications of Right of Way to local jurisdictions;
iii. Non-permanent grants of property interests including but not limited to
temporary construction easements, licenses, and all leases under 7 years
in duration;
iv. All property interests with a fair market value under the GM’s delegated
contracting authority.2
b. This provision does not preclude the GM from seeking a separate delegation of
authority from the Board for specific projects or circumstances, and does not
modify any prior delegations by the Board.
4. Annual Reporting:
a. The GM/ CEO shall provide an annual report to Board summarizing all
permanent property interests granted to third parties during the prior year,
including location of the property, type of interest granted, and value received.
5. Federal Transit Administration requirements:
a. All project property in which there is a federal interest shall follow FTA
requirements before a transfer of that property interest can be completed.
b. If there are conflicts between this policy and any applicable Federal
requirements, the Federal requirements shall govern.

Please find attached a draft Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property. As explained
previously to the Board, currently there is no policy on unsolicited proposals for real
property. A one-page flow chart depicting the proposed joint development review process
is also attached. This flow chart has been provided to the Board previously and is a good
reference for understanding the proposed process for joint development proposals.
Staff will be presenting this for Board review and input at the November 3 Planning and
Development Committee along with the Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of
Excess Property. It is staff's intent to answer questions and provide clarifications, as well
as identify any concerns at the November P&D Committee and subsequently during the
month of November. It is expected that a final resolution and policy will be brought

I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. In 2010, the District
adopted the Revised Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution 17 Series of 2010), in order to enhance
the value and effectiveness of transit in the district by increasing ridership, and providing
opportunities for enhanced transit infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to encourage
innovation in leveraging RTD’s real property assets while establishing a consistent process and
transparent criteria for review and acceptance of any unsolicited proposals.
This policy replaces Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TOD (revised, 2010) and establishes
policies and procedures for the review of unsolicited proposals from third parties wishing to
acquire excess District Property or proposing a joint development of District Property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has determined there is no current
or future transit interest.
3. Exclusive Negotiation Period: period which is granted to an entity to exclusively
negotiate with RTD staff the terms of a property disposition or joint development prior
to Board approval. During the Exclusive Negotiation Period, the District will not market
the property or consider alternate proposals for disposition or joint development.
4. Fair Market Value: The amount at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
5. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,

costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
6. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.
7. Project Property: Any real property or improvements included in the costs of an FTAassisted project, or as otherwise provided under current Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) guidance.1
8. Permanent Real Property Interest: Fee simple, long-term leasehold fifty years or more
in duration, and inclusion in a condominium or common interest community.
III. Policy:
A. Purchase Offers for Excess Property:
The following process will govern third party offers to acquire excess District Property.
1. Availability of District Property:
a. The District will maintain a list of excess property which is available for
disposition. Anyone interested in acquiring property from the District, which is
not identified on the excess property list must submit a written inquiry to
determine if the property is available for disposition:
Senior Manager of Real Property
Regional Transportation District
1560 Broadway, FAS-61
Denver, CO, 80202
b. Upon receipt of an inquiry, the Real Property and TOD committee will review the

property is available for disposition.
2. Property Offerings:

the District property.
4. Board Approval:
