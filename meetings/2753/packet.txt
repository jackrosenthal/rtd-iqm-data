6.A

Discussion:

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the Colorado
General Assembly had passed a law in February that fixed a
mistake which had inadvertently halted the collection of
marijuana tax revenues by RTD the Scientific and Cultural
Facilities District (SCFD) and a number of other entities. The
new law, passed in February, allowed for marijuana tax
revenues to again flow to RTD provided that the Board
certified to the Colorado Department of Revenue that no
further vote of the electorate was required by the Colorado
constitution and under applicable case law by the Colorado
Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals to do so. He
indicated that the certification requirement came about as a
result of a pending Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) case
which involved RTD and SCFD being undecided at the
Supreme Court at the time that the general assembly passed
the new bill in February. That case involved a statute which
was passed in 2013 and RTD and SCFD won that case, and
relevant statements were made in the case opinion which
were helpful in deciding this issue. He noted that staff had
recently provided the Board with copies of the legal opinion
analyzing whether the legal authorities required a vote and,
now that the Supreme Court case had been decided in RTD’s
favor, his opinion was that no further vote was required to
resume collection of the marijuana tax under TABOR, other
provisions under the Colorado constitution, or other case law.
He stated that he had drafted a recommended resolution
containing the necessary certifications so that RTD could again
collect marijuana tax revenue. He noted that the SCFD had
already undergone the same exercise as the Board and had
already issued their certification to the Colorado Department of
Revenue. He added that there was some urgency, and if
RTD’s certification was not submitted by May 17th, both RTD
and the SCFD would not be able to collect marijuana tax
revenue until the following January. He commented that, if the
certification were submitted before May 17th, RTD could begin
to collect marijuana tax revenue beginning July 1st. He further
added that the new Supreme Court opinion had language
supporting the concept of being able to resume collection of a
previously voter authorized tax in a situation like this, when

Packet Pg. 6

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

6.A

Director Menten said that she provided each Director with an
original promotional flyer produced by RTD in an effort to sell
the FasTracks program to the voters. She noted that she had
highlighted one portion of the flyer, which indicated that sales
tax would not apply to groceries. She said that with the sales
tax parity, otherwise referred to as the dirty dozen bills, there
was a sales tax on certain groceries and asked if RTD was
collecting sales tax on groceries.
Mr. Asphaug stated that, if Director Menten was referring to
the bill from 2013, it was sustained as constitutional by the
Colorado Supreme Court.
Director Folska, Ph.D., commented that Director Menten’s
remarks were off topic and asked to either call the question or
get back on topic.
Chair Tisdale asked Director Menten to be more concise with
her question.
Director Menten remarked that RTD staff waited to bring
forward the marijuana reinstatement of a retired tax because
of the Supreme Court ruling for the tax of some grocery
products and added that she would like to continue with this
discussion as she thought it was appropriate.
Chair Tisdale said that the Supreme Court needed to rule their
decision before RTD could move forward because RTD needed
to know if the action that needed to be taken was in
compliance with the Supreme Court decision.
Director Menten commented that the Board owed it to the tax
payers to have the discussion. She noted that one bill was
referred to as the pop and candy act. She said that if a food
product was qualified as junk food it would be taxed, and to

Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the legislature made a mistake which caused the collection of
an existing voter-approved tax to be inadvertently interrupted.
He reiterated that this was not a new tax, or a tax policy
change under TABOR, but an effort to fix a mistake so that an
existing voter-approved tax could be properly collected.

6.A

Director Mihalik noted that he too took issue with the opinion
and how it diluted the meaning and intent of TABOR and
added that this would set a dangerous precedent for future
TABOR opinions.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that it was clear to her that this
was something that the voters approved, and, only because of
an error by the Colorado legislature was the reason for RTD’s
discussion. She added that RTD was not issuing the tax, the
state was.
Chair Tisdale remarked that the legislature did admit it was a
mistake on their part and it needed to be remedied.
Director Lubow said that she would be voting in favor of this
item. She added that, while she appreciated the opinions of
those opposed, the standard of reasonableness was something
that the courts had the right to consider.
Director Catlin noted that she shared some of the same
concerns with the ruling as Director Mihalik. However, she
noted that she would rather RTD have the ability to control
that tax than to have it put into the black hole of government
spending.
Director Hoy said that there should be a distinction between
groceries and marijuana. He noted that the Supreme Court
dealt with the grocery issue, and they may have watered
down TABOR, but the issue this evening was whether RTD
should collect marijuana taxes as it did in the past. He added

Packet Pg. 8

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

her, it was immoral to tax food. She added that the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force was created to increase sales tax
and the numbers mentioned in their documents indicated that
it would raise sales tax revenue by $3 to $12 million. She
added that TABOR was very clear that tax policy changes are
supposed to go to the taxpayers. She further added that she
strongly disagreed with the policy actions and, that if the
marijuana tax resolution passed, she could not trust
government.

6.A

that the tax went away by mistake and the Board should
acknowledge that and move forward.

Director Menten asked if she could submit a minority report. She wanted to make it
clear that she was not a unanimous vote.
Chair Tisdale stated that the official record would show that she was a no vote.

B. Recommended Actions

• Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and Budget Transfer due to
Operator Wage Increases
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
increase contract authority for the following fixed-route contracts: First
Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract
#14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First
Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs
incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the
contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority
on contract #14-DH-003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the
Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a revised contract authority of
$132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority
on contract #14-DH-021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the
Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a revised contract authority of
$142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority
on contract #15-DH-064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the
Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a revised contract authority of
$72,975,454.00.

6.B

Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a revised contract authority of
$148,679,846.00.

It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize budget transfers in a total
amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018 Board-appropriated
reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased
costs incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases
for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00
 Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00
This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services;
Task Goal #1, Fiscal Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and
Human Capital.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, noted that this had
been brought up as an informational item at the committee
meeting the previous month. He said that this action item
would help stabilize the contractor workforce as there were
concerns with the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
that had been adopted. He added that this action item would
help keep some parity with RTD’s private sector contractors.
Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services,
noted that all of the information was included in the Board
Report. She added that staff had conversations with its private
contractors since the new CBA went into effect, and 125 out
of 840 contractor operators had approached them with
concerns about the disparity in operator wages. Staff is
concerned that by not allowing the contactors to increase their
wages there might be some cannibalization of the contractor
operators as they move to work directly for RTD.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the
next four (4) years while these services are rebid.

6.B

Director Broom asked if RTD’s existing contracted services
contracts had escalator clauses to deal with issues like this.
Ms. Conover stated that they did not.

Director Folska, Ph.D., echoed Director Broom’s comments
and said that it should not be a surprise to staff that
negotiations with Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) 1001
would occur every three years and the outcome of that
negotiation would affect contractor agreements as well. She
then inquired as to how much RTD’s contractors pay for the
buses that they get from RTD.
Ms. Conover stated that RTD did not charge contractors for
the use of RTD buses.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why the contractors did not
provide the increase on their own without RTD interference.
Ms. Conover explained that the new wages amounted to a
large increase. She noted that RTD’s starting operator wage
was $19.40 and the contractor’s starting wage was only
$17.50, so it was a big difference.
Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired as to what the range was for
the contractor agreements.
Ms. Conover explained that each contract was between three
to five years and they were all staggered. She noted that staff
was looking at accelerating the re-bid process for the next
contract so that they were quicker.
Mr. Ford noted that the increase would not be applied to the
contractor’s profit margin, but would be applied to the basic
wages and selected supervision of the contractor operators.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that this was about the
contractors maintaining their current profit margin and passing
on their costs to RTD.
Director Anderson said that if RTD gave their drivers increased
wages, and there were plenty of openings for operators,
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom suggested that future contracts have escalator
clauses so that staff would not have to come to the Board
every time a wage increase was needed.

6.B

contracted operators would eventually move over to RTD for
jobs. She said that those in the suburbs who were served by
contracted services such as First Transit for bus service would
not have enough operators to maintain service, therefore she
would be supporting this.

Ms. Conover stated that it would be up to the contractors to
negotiate what their starting wage would be and the
progression for the rest of their employees. She noted that
$18.00 to $18.50 would be the target pay range.
Director Lubow asked if that meant that RTD did not know
what would be spent.
Ms. Conover explained that the total amount could be less
than anticipated, but it would not be more than what the
Board had authorized.

 4:13pm: Train 4017/18 departed DIA with passengers – OCC
instructs operator to couple to the disabled train ahead and push to
61st and Pena Station
 4:18pm: Train 4017/18 reports train disabled – “will not take power”
 4:19pm: Two disabled trains are stranded with passengers on-board
– a major service disruption began to unfold
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that the problems were caused by:
 The OCC assumed the initial power problem on train 4045/46 was
due to a train-related fault
 The Traction Power System (overhead catenary system) did not
experience any faults and indicated a normal state at the OCC
 The overhead wires were intact and the traction power system
remained energized, however a piece of the hardware assembly
supporting the OCS had failed
 The “steady arm” component of the cantilever beam supporting the
OCS fractured
 The free swinging steady arm made contact with the passing trains
and broke the shear pins supporting the trains’ pantographs causing
the trains to lose contact with the overhead wire and lose power
Ms. Herzenberg stated that the recovery effort for train 4045/46, the first
disabled train was:
 4:03pm: Train 4045/46 was disabled with passengers on board
 4:42pm: OCC requested a bus bridge
 4:42pm: a third train was off loaded at 61st and Pena Station and
sent to rescue the train 4045/46 from the south
 Multiple efforts to couple to train 4045/46 were unsuccessful due to
weather conditions and a steep grade
 6:54pm: successful couple, southbound tow in progress
 7:13pm: passengers on train are unloaded at 61st and Pena
 Total time passengers were on disabled train = 190 minutes

Ms. Herzenberg commented that RTD’s concerns and criticism about its
communications with customers and RTD was well founded. Furthermore:
 Communications directly with passengers on the failed trains, with
other passengers on the line, and with RTD was disjointed, unreliable,
and inaccurate at times
 Despite considerable efforts by DTO staff:
o Communication Systems were not used effectively
o Efforts were confused with results (many messages were
made – but often proved unreliable due to the lack of specifics
or changing circumstances)
o Our passengers were just not well informed – neither was RTD
Ms. Herzenburg said that the events lead to a major disruption because:
 During initial stages, the OCC failed to accurately assess the cause
and magnitude of the problem
 Attempts to couple the first disabled train were complicated by
extreme weather conditions and a steep grade
 Severe weather affected decisions that may have led to evacuating
passengers on to the right-of-way
 Trains were stranded at least 4 miles from the closest station
 Inexperience - DTO personnel have not encountered this type of
incident before
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that lessons learned for DTO operations included:
 Treating all disabled trains between stations as a potential emergency
– understanding the potential for a prolonged event
 Operational tactics need review – focus on taking care of the
passengers first – moving the train is secondary
 Limit the time passengers are stranded before evacuation is ordered.
FRA and RTD view evacuation to the ground as a last option.
 Review SOPs and the EPREP – plug gaps
 Training for operations personnel needs to be re-examined especially
procedures and preparation for dealing with abnormal circumstances

OCC communication systems were not used effectively
Customers received inconsistent and unreliable information
The OCC was slow to realize the magnitude of the problems and, as
a result, important information flow was compromised
Reliable descriptions of the service impacts were not conveyed to
RTD via the ReadyOps Notification system
DTO did not supplement the OCC with additional customer service
staff until well into the emergency
On-board and station announcements were not used effectively
Quality matters not just quantity
During emergencies, staff the OCC with additional communications
staff
Utilize existing systems and technology better
o The OCC could have communicated directly with passengers
on-board the disabled trains – it did not
o ReadyOps messaging was too generic – notifications require
specifics
o Station public address and variable messaging systems were
underutilized
Review reliance on ReadyOps notification system
Automated communications were not enough

Ms. Herzenberg said that plans to prevent recurrence included:
 Evaluating failure analysis of fractured bracket
 Improving DTO Operational Responses
 Improving Communication with RTDC Customers
 Improving Communication with RTD Management and Staff
 Continuously test operational readiness
 Consider all the input from the after-action review – apply lessons
learned
 Augment training program (June 30)
o Incorporating quarterly table-top drills into existing operations
staff training program
o Underscore emphasis on tactical decision making during
abnormal circumstances
o Emphasis on rigor of communication protocols at all levels –
within the OCC, on trains, in stations, RTD notifications, Rider
Alerts, etc.
o Hands-on equipment training for field supervisors (interim

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that in summary:
 Operational readiness will be improved
 Communications with RTD will improve
 And improving communications with our customers is our highest
priority

Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked Ms. Herzenberg for her update and
DTO’s plans to improve service in the future. She added that people realize
that there will be some type of breakdown, but they do not understand
being held hostage while staff tries to figure out what the problem was. She
added that this incident was in her district and constituents were calling her
trying to figure out what was causing the delay. She further added that RTD
and DTO need to get people off stranded trains, no matter how long the
delay.
Director Williams asked if a big part of the issue was the location of the
stalled trains.
Ms. Herzenberg said yes. She noted that both trains were four miles from
the nearest station, and the closest gate in the fence was far off. She added
that both RTD and the FRA have said that evacuating passengers to the
ground was the last resort. She noted that in hindsight DTO should not have
attempted to couple the trains and the rescue train should have been
brought in from the beginning. She added that DTO would examine the
location and position where the trains broke down again.
Director Archuleta commented that the entire presentation seemed like a
fancy way of saying if it breaks, it will be fixed. He added that train tickets
should have a disclaimer indicating that passengers ride at their own risk.
Mr. Ford stated that RTD took this matter very seriously. He remarked that
RTD was meeting with DTO and staff to provide the best customer service,
and added that RTD did not want to have a system that people were
hesitant to use. He added that he was on one of the trains, so he had
firsthand knowledge of what happened that day. He stated that RTD was
providing more oversight and recommendations to DTO to train them for
how to correctly respond to these type of incidents.
Director Anderson commented that, while people were uncomfortable,
luckily no one was hurt. She noted that when trains couple it is a very
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Herzenberg added that in the future DTO would treat every train issue
as a full scale emergency. She commented that DTO will need to examine
the situation and be very careful about their response before taking any
action. She stated that DTO needed to improve all aspects of its
communication as well as continue to improve its operational readiness.

6.B

dangerous maneuver, and she was happy to know that no one was injured
in the process.
Director Broom asked if DTO could use tugs similar to those used by
airplanes to move disabled trains to the nearest station. He noted that, if
there was a power issue, it would need to be diesel or battery powered, but
it was something RTD and DTO should look into.

General Manager Genova commented that RTD owned a Nordco Mobile
Railcar Mover but it was only for use on light rail tracks. He said that RTD
had recently replaced its outdated Mercedes-Benz Unimog in 2016, but the
Nordco could not be used on the commuter rail tracks because it was not
FRA compliant.
Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed with Director Anderson that safety was RTD’s
number one priority, but she said that the situation that occurred on April
20th was not acceptable. She stated that, when trains break down,
passengers need to be removed from the stranded trains and bus bridges
need to be implemented as soon as possible.
Ms. Herzenberg noted that DTO had tried to find a suitable rescue train for
the past two years but they had still been unable to find one.
Director Folska, Ph.D., suggested that if DTO could not find the right rescue
train they should invent one. She noted that other train companies could
potentially need the same design too. She added that DTO should
incorporate the Japanese way of thinking of “Look, See, Say”.
Director Sisk stated that both RTD and DTO had glossed over the 230
passengers that were inconvenienced and that was part of the public
relations effort that was lacking. He said that both agencies failed its
constituents and left them stranded on two trains for hours without any
explanation and that was unacceptable. He added that a situation like that
could not happen again and both agencies need to reach out to the
inconvenienced passengers to make it right.
Chair Tisdale commented that DTO came to fall on their sword, as it was
appropriate. He noted that it did not fix the problem, but DTO was taking
the necessary steps to address their failure. He remarked that the biggest
part of the failure was the lack of communication to the individuals stuck on
the two trains and added that it was compelling for him to find out that
RTD’s own COO was on one of those trains, and the only way he was able
to find out any information was because he called internally to RTD staff.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that RTD already owned something like that.

6.B

Director Lubow remarked that what happened was very disappointing. She
asked if DTO intended to have more emergency planning exercises.
Ms. Herzenberg said yes, and added that quarterly table top exercises would
reinforce that as well.

Ms. Herzenberg stated that table top exercises put staff on the spot. She
explained that staff would be asked how they would handle a certain
emergency and their responses would then be compared against the
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). She noted that table top exercises
would be recorded so staff could see what ideas were beneficial, and which
ideas did not conform to the SOP.
Director Lubow asked what the difference was between table top exercises
and drills.
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that drills were acted out in the field and noted
that DTO had recently performed a drill on the G Line in Arvada.
Director Lubow inquired if DTO would schedule drills regularly.
Mr. Ford said yes, and he noted that was something that RTD was asking
DTO to do since they are critically important.
Director Lubow noted that coupling exercises in steep grades should be at
the top of DTO’s training and exercise list as well.
Director Menten asked if the broken bracket that was shown in the
presentation was aluminum.
Ms. Herzenberg stated that it was cast-aluminum.
Director Menten inquired as to how many cast-aluminum brackets existed on
the University of Colorado A Line.
Mr. Herzenberg said there were hundreds.
Director Menten asked if the bracket was a typical design, or if it was a
custom made piece.
Ms. Herzenberg remarked that the design was used by a lot of agencies, but
the investigation into the cause of the failure was still underway.

Director Lubow inquired as to what exactly a table top exercise entailed.

6.B

Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, said that RTD’s
requirement was that DTO performed adequate preventative maintenance.
He said that staff understood components would fail from time to time, but
those failures should be caught before a critical situation occurred.

Director Williams commented that there were trains that break all over the
country. She added that recently her staff was in Washington D.C. and their
train broke down, had to be towed, and they were stuck on the train for 90
minutes. She remarked that this was a learning experience and if RTD and
DTO move and improve on the lessons learned, service would improve.
Director Walker said that, to his recollection, there have been three well
known failures for the University of Colorado A Line. He noted that most of
the failures had occurred near the bridge heading towards Denver
International Airport (DIA) and asked if there was something significant
about that area.
Ms. Herzenberg said that the area around DIA was subject to lightning, more
so than other places.
Director Walker stated that the lack of communication was unacceptable
and he hoped that some of the steps being addressed were also transferable
to the G Line and the light rail system.
Director Hoy remarked that he agreed with a majority of the comments
made, but he was concerned with the part of the process that failed. He
noted that DTO’s investigation should consider if the broken component was
the right piece for the system and location. He added that he was
disappointed that RTD’s reputation was tarnished with this incident and it
hurt when something like this happened and hoped that DTP shared in that
pain. He asked if there was a cost associated with the problem to DTO,
such as reimbursing RTD for bus bridges.
Ms. Herzenberg said yes, DTO reimbursed RTD for bus bridges on the
commuter rail.
Director Solano asked how often DTO performed quality control testing and
inspection of components.
Ms. Herzenberg said that DTO’s maintenance program was based on
preventative maintenance and thar the line was checked every night. She
said other checks were performed at different levels of frequency.
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. Herzenberg added that DTO had an extensive preventative maintenance
program, and some work was completed during the day as well as at night.

Director Lubow urged Ms. Herzenberg and Mr. Thompson to come back in a
few months to provide the Board with another presentation that outlined
what changes had been made and implemented.

Mr. Ford noted that RTD continued to provide a steady level of service at
98.7%, but the agency was still having issues with driver retention and
operators working 6 days. He added that RTD continuined to have
challenges with bus bridges and fulfilling needs for other special events that
impacted operations. He noted that staff was monitoring and working on
operator retention and recruitment efforts and staff was increasing activity
on those fronts.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited
financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2017 as prepared
by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Assistant
General Manager of Finance and Administration, introduced
Cheryl Wallace from the auditing firm of RubinBrown, LLP
(RubinBrown).
Ms. Wallace highlighted the results of the financial statement
and single audit from December 31, 2017, from the
ViewPoints presentation included in the Board packet which
contained the communication that every auditor is required to
Packet Pg. 24

6.C

Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown provided the following
services:
 Financial statement audits for the year ended December
31, 2017
 Single audit for the year ended December 31, 2017
 National Transit Database Federal Funding Allocation
Statistics Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement for the
year ended December 31, 2017
 Report on Cost of General Manager’s Contract
She highlighted the objectives of a financial statement audit:
 Report to those charged with governance
o RTD Board of Directors
 Provide an opinion on whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement
 Obtain an understanding of the entity’s internal controls
 Audit procedures include:
o Review risks impacting the financial reporting
process
o Perform inquiries and analytical procedures
o Verify and substantiate selected account
balances or a sample of certain
o transactions
o Update our understanding of IT security risks
Ms. Wallace noted that the required auditor communication
began on page 9 of the presentation and she explained that
the left side of the report outlined the auditing standards and
the right side was the response from RubinBrown. She stated
that the audit was performed following governmental auditing
standards. Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown had issued
an unmodified opinion that was previously called an
unqualified opinion or a clean opinion. She noted that
RubinBrown planned and scoped the audit through an
engagement letter dated October 16, 2017. Ms. Wallace
explained that RubinBrown was responsible to report to the
governing body any changes in accounting practices and their
application and summarized the following findings:

Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

provide to a governing body. She stated that RTD had retained
RubinBrown to perform a single audit and a financial
statements audit because RTD had received federal awards
over $750,000, and that RTD had also engaged RubinBrown
to issue an opinion on RTD’s federal awards.

6.C



No new accounting policies were adopted, and the
application of existing policies was not changed.
We noted no transactions entered into during the year
for which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or
consensus, with the exception of the P3, which the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) had
yet to address.
No significant transactions have been recognized in a
different period than when the transactions occurred.

Ms. Wallace explained that RubinBrown evaluated the key
factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in
determining that they were reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole. She identified the most
sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements as:
 Management’s estimate of depreciation is based upon
estimated useful lives of capital assets.
 Management’s estimate of the allowance for bad debts
is based on management’s review of outstanding
receivables.
 Management’s estimate of the net pension liability is
based on actuarial valuations and employee census
data.
Ms. Wallace stated that RTD had several financial disclosures
that were particularly sensitive because of their significance to
financial statement. However, she said the disclosures were
neutral, consistent and clear. She explained the most sensitive
disclosures affecting the financial statements were:
 The disclosure of investments in Note B
 The disclosure of capital assets in Note D
 The disclosure of long-term debt in Note E
 The disclosure of employee retirement and unearned
compensation plans in Note F
 The disclosure of commitments and contingencies in
Note H
 The disclosure of the tax, spending and debt limitations
in Note K
Ms. Wallace explained that the RTD finance team prepared the
document and that there were no difficulties encountered in
dealing with the management related to the performance of
the audit. She detailed the following audit adjustments that
were proposed as a result of the audit:



Interest expense was adjusted for prepaid TABOR
Secured Interest in the amount $40,953,636. This
adjustment increased the change in net position by the
same amount.

Ms. Wallace stated that RubinBrown had one recommendation
regarding the Public Private Partnership (P3) arrangement. She
explained that impacts to financial reporting were not
consistently evaluated throughout the project to consider the
changes and that the project was nearing full completion with
several amendments and anticipated amendments to contract
provisions. She said RubinBrown recommended that
management perform a comprehensive review of the key
clauses of the P3 agreement, which included but were not
limited to, completion of project, termination clauses and
changes in service, any potential accounting, budgetary and
financial reporting impacts. Further the suggested a review at
least annually with a key member of the financial management
team related to the impacted areas.
Ms. Wallace stated that the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) had been very active implementing
future financial disclosures and that RTD would need to report
on the following:
 GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than
Pensions
o Effective for 2018 RTD year end
o Similar effect to GASB 68 for other
postemployement benefits (health and welfare
plans), i.e., ATU Division 1001 Health and
Welfare Trust. RTD would be required to report
the benefit plan’s projected liability.
 GASB Statement No. 87, Leases
o Effective for 2019 year end
o Established a single model for lease accounting
based on the principle that leases were
financings of the right to use an underlying asset
o Application of this standard would go beyond
the previous guidance related to the recording of
Packet Pg. 27

Ms. Wallace stated that professional standards required her
firm to accumulate all misstatements identified during the
audit, other than those that were trivial, and communicate
them to the appropriate level of management but she said
there were no uncorrected misstatements in the RTD report.

leased assets. The standard would require
additional leased items on the books be recorded
as intangible right-to-use assets and related
liabilities.

Ms. McKillop explained that the FFGA had been withheld
because the G Line had not opened and that, as soon as the G
Line opened, the funds would be released. She added that the
funds from the FFGA were not an accounting issue and that
the money had been appropriated but could not be withdrawn.
Ms. McKillop stated the RubinBrown recommendations
regarding the P3 project were regarding what to classify as
reimbursable and set accounting standards of the funds for the
future.
Director Broom asked how pension reporting had changed in
the last few years.
Ms. Wallace explained that the GASB found significant
differences
in
pension
reporting
between
for-profit
corporations and governments. She stated that in the past, if
the actuary stated that payments had been made, then there
was no issue, and in 2008 some pension plans lost retirement
funds and that brought about the new requirements for
government pension reporting. Ms. Wallace explained that
government appropriate budgets yearly and the pension
reporting needed to include what the total benefits payments
would be, assets, investments, and expenditures in order to
assess the total liability for benefit plans.
Director Broom asked if an agency could have a negative net
worth by booking that liability.
Ms. Wallace described the issue with Public Employees
Retirement Association (PERA) and that the previous reporting
standard had a negative impact on net position for many
governmental entities.

RTD paid off 22 years in advance.

• Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party Services
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82
million from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the commuter rail
operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to
compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work
associated with third party agreements. The FasTracks Management
Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds
that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the
impacts to its operation.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1
– Fiscal Sustainability.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018
Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Ms. McKillop stated that RTD had worked with third party
partners, including stakeholders, local governments, and

third parties requesting the work would reimburse RTD for all
costs associated with these betterments, so these betterments
were done at no net cost to RTD, and that RTD must pay DTP
for its costs related to these improvements.

Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance stated that the two
largest projects are for the City and County of Denver (CCD)
road related projects such as the Central Park Road widening
and the Wewatta viaduct structure.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why CCD was not doing their
own projects.
Ms. Cohen explained that if CCD performed the work they
would impact RTD rail and have to coordinate with RTD
projects in order to perform any work. She stated that RTD
may see service impacts from third party construction projects
that require access to the right-of-way. She explained the
project varied from utilities that pass under the track, or
construction on bridges over the track and that in these
instances, DTP may be required to provide access to the track,
or to modify service, to allow the third party construction.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked how long it would take for CCD
to reimburse RTD for the city’s projects.
Ms. McKillop stated that CCD pays within thirty to sixty days
of invoicing.
Director Hoy asked for clarification between the FasTracks
Management Reserve and what Ms. McKillop stated was the
Board Reserve.
Ms. McKillop stated that it was one and the same and
explained that the FasTracks Management Reserve was a
reserve that the Board set aside out of the base system, but in
order to draw money from that reserve, it must be Board
approved.

C. Updates

• Salaried Trust Actuarial Report
Ms. McKillop introduced Wendy Londa from Rael and Letson to provide the
update on the salaried employees’ pension plan fund status.
Ms. Londa reminded the Board that the Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan
was reviewed each year by an actuarial for a fund status report.
Ms. Londa reviewed the following information from the presentation that
was included in the Board packet:
Valuation Highlights as of January 1, 2017
 Total participant count decreased by 12 (from 687 to 675)
 Plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008

Trust “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the
Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer to contributing.
Last year, based on January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation results and
an estimated 2016 net investment return of 9.4%, the Plan was
projected to reach 100% funding in 2043 with a $4.6M contribution
each year if all assumptions were met in the future.
What has changed since last year?
 The actual net investment return for 2016 was 9.3% based on
the 12/31/2016 Plan audit.
 The Plan experienced a $2.3M salary gain in 2016 (2.5%
average salary increase for continuing actives compared to an
expected weighted average increase of 5.0%).
Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, the Plan is projected to
reach 100% funding in 2042 (1 year earlier) with a $4.6M
contribution each year if all actuarial assumptions were met in the
future, including a net investment return of 7.5% per year beginning
in 2017.
What happened since the final January 1, 2017 valuation results
were issued?
 The Board approved a $5.1M contribution for the 2018 Fiscal
Year; the actuary’s recommended contribution was $7.3M.
 The investment return in 2017 exceeded the 7.50%
assumption – the preliminary 2017 net return is 14.2%.
Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, a $5.1M contribution in
2018, and a 14.2% preliminary net return on assets in 2017, if all
actuarial assumptions were met each year, including a net investment
return of 7.5% per year beginning in 2018:
 If future contributions were equal to $5.1M (or the
recommended contribution if lower), the funding level is
projected to reach 100% in 2031 (end of the 14-year
amortization period) with recommended contributions dropping
below $5.1M in 2022.
 The recommended contribution ranges from $4.9M in
2022 down to $0.8M in 2032.
 If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2019,
the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2031 (end of
the 14-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $5.1M in 2022.
 The recommended contribution ranges from $5.9M in
2019 down to $4.7M in 2022 and $0.8M in 2032.
Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a
significant impact on projected liabilities – we would keep the Board
apprised of the impact of the Plan’s investment performance on
future costs.

Projections
 14.2% preliminary net return in 2017, 7.50% in all future years
 Reflects a $4.6 million contribution in 2017 and a $5.1 million
contribution in 2018.
 Assets reflect a preliminary market rate of return of 14.2%, net of
investment expenses, in 2017, and assumes a market rate of return
of 7.50%, net of investment expenses, in each future year thereafter.
 Assumes all other assumptions were met in 2017 and each future
year.
 As of 1/1/2017, the amortization period is 14 years.
Next Steps
 We would continue to monitor and review the following items going
forward:
 The Plan’s funding level and recommended contribution
amount.
 Actuarial assumptions and methods:
 The Trustees of the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension
Plan were considering lowering the interest assumption
– which would increase Plan liabilities and lower the
benchmark for future investment returns.
 Policies adopted by other public pension plan systems.
 All such items would be reviewed by Rael & Letson and discussed
with the Board annually.
Director Hoy asked what would be the disadvantage of funding more in
order to reach full funding faster.
Ms. McKillop stated that RTD should be funding closer to the level of the
actuarial recommendation of 7.3%. She added that the agency had not been
had a situation where performance for investment was up in some time.
Ms. Londa stated that the 14.2% return for 2017 painted a different picture
for the funding status of the pension plan.
Ms. McKillop explained that the trustees concern was that it was unlikely
that the investment rate would continue at the same rate of return and that
was why she recommended a slight increase rate of investment each year in
order to get achieve full funding of the plan earlier than projected and to set
the agency up for better plans for the future.
Director Hoy clarified that the goal was to get to full funding sooner.
Director Hoy ask who made the investment decisions.

concession agreement
- Begin seven years after corridor opening
Ms. McKillop explained that at this time last year RTD was forecasted to
have to transfer money from the base system to FasTracks, and currently
that would not have to happen. She added that the FISA account was
already being drawn down and that also was not needed. Ms. McKillop
stated that the financial position was substantially better than last year due
to the revenue forecast and was expecting to maintain this through 2024.

Opportunities and Challenges
 Opportunities
- Board strategic priorities and GM tactical plans
- Fuel lock for favorable outcome
 Challenges
- Sales/use tax volatility
- Fuel price uncertainty
- SOGR commitments and needs
- Project prioritization, project deferral
- Financing capacity, funding constraints
- Continued refunding of reserve fund balances
- Increased O&M costs
- Completion of ongoing FasTracks projects
- Funding of currently unfunded FasTracks corridors
- Debt service coverage (combined) of 1.2x may require
o Higher reserve balances
o Reduction in expense projects
o Other sources of funds
Next Steps
 June 26 – Adoption of 2018 Amended Budget
 July 10 – Presentation of second draft mid-term financial plan at FAAC,
first draft long-range financial plan
 August 14 – Presentation of third draft mid-term financial plan, second
draft long-range financial plan
 September 11 – Presentation of final mid-term and long-range financial
plan, and 2019 Requested Budget at FAAC
 September 18 – Adoption of mid-term and long-range financial plans
Ms. McKillop stated that this is the planned schedule but she said that the
outcome of the Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) would have an impact
on the schedule because the current plan assumes a fare increase and that
there may be revisions due to adoption of the PPWG recommendation.
Director Broom stated that listed under uncontrollable variables were interest
rates on debt and asked if the agency had variable rate debt, how much of
this type of debt, and how much the rates increased.
Ms. Scarpino explained that must be a mistake and the RTD debt was all at
a fixed rate.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for examples of the deferred capital projects.

Ms. McKillop stated that she would provide that list of all the projects being
considered for the $65 million in project requests (capital and expense) that
need to be eliminated, reduced, or deferred in Base System.
Director Lubow asked if the North Metro Line would be completed to State
Highway 7 or to 124th Avenue within the six year plan.

Director Lubow asked what the consequences would be for not making the
1.2 times debt service coverage requirement.
Ms. McKillop stated that she had met with the rating agencies because the
agency had not met the required debt ratio and were not expected to meet it
the last plan. She added that rating agencies would receive a copy of RTD’s
short-term and long-term model to be aware of any problems the agency
may encounter. Ms. McKillop stated that the consequences would be that
both RTD COPs and outstanding bonds were downgraded, that RTD had
high ratings which meant that RTD interest rates when bonds were issued
were lower, and that RTD had been able to take an advantage because the
agency was well respected in the investment community for high, solid
COPs or bonds. She stated that RTD was not expecting issued debt in the
near future and any issued debt would be subject to a new rating. Ms.
McKillop stated that the other issue was that the agency may be violating a
Board policy by not maintaining the required 1.2 times debt service
coverage. She explained that in the financial plan last year the agency was
expected to meet the requirement in 2026 and this year was expected to
meet it in 2023, so there was improvement. Ms. McKillop stated that the
financial department was working on determining what it would take to
meet the debt service coverage requirement in 2019 and if the agency could
afford that.
Director Lubow asked when the Board would receive a cash flow graph.
Ms. McKillop stated that the cash flow graph would be included in the long–
term financial plan.

Fare Box Revenue targets were set by the RTD Board of Directors
The Board’s Fiscal Policy Statement directs staff to plan on a fare
adjustment every three (3) years to adjust to inflation
 Policy directs staff to review potential fare adjustments to establish a
fare structure to ensure that it:
o Is understandable
o Is implementable
o Is equitable
 Achieves the revenue levels established in the Mid-Range Financial
Plan (Formerly SBP & APE)
 The current Mid-Term Financial Plan for 2018-2023 incorporates a
planned fare increase assumption in both 2019 and 2022.
o Approximately 10% in 2019 and 10% in 2022
Current Fare Structure
 $2.60 for Regional
 $9.00 for airport
2019 Fare Change Proposal Three Alternatives
 Primary Fare Change Proposal Elements:
o 3-Hour Pass to replace One-way Trip with 3-hour transfer
o EcoPass, NECOPass and CollegePass - Price based upon the
previous year’s utilization
o FlexPass – Retain without discount
o MyRide – Retain without discount ($0.25)
o 10-Ride Ticket Book – Retain without discount (10%)
o ValuPass – Discontinue (purchase 12 monthly passes instead)
 Three Alternatives Summary
o No Increase in the Base Fare
 Doesn’t generate enough revenue to meet fare targets in
current SBP/APE
 Insufficient revenue generated by eliminating discounts and
transitioning to utilization pricing for pass programs to
introduce 70% discount for Youth or Low Income Program
o Regularly Scheduled Fare Change
 Local One-Way $2.60 to $2.90
 Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.00
 Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.00
o Pass Program Working Group Recommendation
 Local One-Way $2.60 to $3.00
 Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.25
 Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.50
 70% discount for Youth
 Maintain Nonprofit Program (Adult & Senior/Disabled
products offered at 50% discount on the full fare;

Youth at 70% discount)
 70% discount for Youth

 40% discount through the Low Income Program
o Alternative 1: No Increase in Base Fare: Modeling Results
 Leaving the Base Fares unchanged results in a sizeable
revenue shortfall (-$36 million) compared to the cumulative
Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021
 This revenue shortfall remains sizable, even with the
elimination of some fare discounts (e.g.: FlexPass, MyRide,
ValuPass, etc.)
 Compared to the Baseline, this alternative results in higher
ridership, due to the lower Base Fare
o Alternative 2: Regularly Scheduled Fare Change: Modeling Results
 The Regularly scheduled fare change would result in
revenue slightly below (-$2 million) the cumulative
Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021
 Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in
a very slight increase in ridership, due in part to the greater
discount offered to Youth customers
o Alternative 3: PPWG Recommendation
 The PPWG recommendation is slightly below (-$2 million)
the cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target
for 2019-2021
 Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in
a slight increase in ridership, due in part to the introduction
of the Low Income Program
Still Evaluating: Staff continues to evaluate implementation of the LowIncome program and Youth discount:
o Low-Income Fare and Youth Fare
o What will it take to apply the discount to all products
o Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the lowest
implementation cost
o Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the soonest
implementation
o Which fare product(s)/media would allow for the simplest
operator/customer interaction
o Is mobile ticketing an accessible option
o Administration: means-testing, proof of eligibility, fare product
acquisition, etc.
o Is the 12 and under free enforceable
Public Engagement Strategy: Guiding Principles
o Community Centered – Engaging the community where they were
and when they’re most available
o Culturally and Linguistically Inclusive – Engage the community
through their culture and use their language
o Strategic Stakeholder Partnerships and Engagement – Identify and

Director Broom asked what the cost would be to implement the change that
kept the existing fare schedule and increase all fares by 10% and offer the
40% discount.

Director Sisk stated that it was expensive to provide the program.
Ms. McKillop explained that was why it would be difficult to implement the
alternative and that the PPWG option balanced a new fare structure.
Mr. Washington stated that the revenue loss was shaded with that
alternative because it was largely dependent upon the type of fare media
and the fare to apply the discount. He explained that if the discount was
applied to unlimited monthly pass there would be a much greater revenue
loss than if the discount would be applied to a stored value MyRide card.
Ms. McKillop agreed with Mr. Washington and explained that the shortfall
was dependent on how the discount would be offered to the public.
Director Broom asked if there would be costs estimates provided for several
different discount percentage amounts.
Ms. McKillop explained that there was not enough money to offer several
different discount options and that it would require a significant raise in the
current base fare.
Director Williams stated that the modeling results of the three alternatives
reported that the revenue loss was relatively small and that, by not
implementing a new fare program, what the agency may lose in public
opinion and reputation would be significant. She added that there was not a
dollar value to be placed on the reputation of RTD by trying to provide the
discounted service to the public and that the agency needed to make the
best out of all the work that was done. Director Williams asked what
percentage of ridership would bear the fare increase to provide discount for
other riders.
Mr. Washington stated that he did not have that information with him but
would send it to Director Williams.

Ms. McKillop stated that the total cost of the program was between $11
and $12 million to implement the 40% discount. She explained that
approximately $6.8 million was applied to the current discount program and
it would cost an additional $7 to $8 million because RTD actually only
receives about half of the $6.8 million to implement the 40% discount
alternative.

Director Anderson stated that she was concerned the outreach would not
include the people that pay the regular fare. She added that she did not
agree that part of RTD riders should be paying for others, which she stated
was unfair. Director Anderson stated she agreed with the plan for children
riding free with a parent or responsible person. She added that the income
level needed to be transparent and that she would like to see an option
where the agency reduced all fares in order to increase ridership. She asked
what routes and services would be impacted by implementing any low
income program.
Ms. McKillop stated that an option to eliminate all discounts, except for
federally mandated discounts, to try to get fares as low as possible was
examined but that resulted in a tremendous amount loss in ridership.
Director Anderson stated that RTD should figure out how to provide the
lowest fares possible and increase ridership and have the taxpayers
subsidize that amount.
Ms. McKillop stated she would provide the modeling results of reducing all
fares option.
Director Anderson stated that the agency had provided the Eco and college
passes and that the options appeared to eliminate those programs.
Ms. McKillop stated that all options keep the ECO, NICO, and college
passes.
Director Anderson stated that the person that does not receive discount
passes and fares pays for the people who do.
Director Lubow stated that the ridership declined on both option 2 and 3 and
why would RTD provide a low income pass that caused ridership to go
down.
Mr. Washington explained that ridership decline was due to the sensitivity to
price increases and that people would ride less if it cost more to ride. He
added that using fares to gain the revenue needed to provide a discounted
pass begin to eat away at the goal to gain ridership.

Director Menten commented that there needed to be more than five
outreach meetings and that five meeting would possibly work if there was
enough advertising and the meetings were held at convenient locations and
hours. She added that the meetings should share the information to the
taxpayers regarding the subsidy and what the current cost was and how it
would increase.

6.C

Ms. McKillop stated that both options 2 and 3 tried to keep the ridership as
high as possible by how passes were implemented.
Director Lubow asked if in option 3 if there would no longer be a nonprofit
program but still have the 50% government requirements.

Director Lubow asked whether nonprofit organizations be negatively
impacted from option 3.
Mr. Washington stated that it would allow nonprofit organizations to expand
the rate at which they can contribute to the transportation services
provided.
Director Lubow asked if there was data that showed ridership decreased
because of the deletion of MyRide and the ten-ride fare book.
Ms. McKillop stated that it was a very small portion that impacted ridership
related to those passes.
Director Lubow asked if those people who were low income but did not
qualify for the low income pass were losing a discount and had to pay
increased fares. She also asked who the riders were that RTD was losing.
Mr. Washington explained that ridership loss came from the increase of the
base fare to $3.00.
Ms. McKillop stated that it was hard to measure exactly which riders RTD
would lose and that currently there was no statistical information to
determine if it would impact cash fare payers.
Director Lubow suggest having a Telephone Town Hall to reach plenty of
people.
Chair Tisdale stated that in the presentation option 2 included senior and
disabled discounts but noted that those are not included in option 3 and
asked to verify that those discounts were federally mandated and regardless
of the option that was being assessed.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 15, 2018 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Washington explained that nonprofit organizations would be able to
purchase fare media on behalf of individuals but that it would not be the
nonprofit program in place currently. He added that there would not be a cap
on the amount of fare media to be purchased on behalf low-income
individuals as there currently is a limit.

6.C

Mr. Washington explained that wording was difficult but that it was
supposed to communicate that there would not be a way to receive a
discount on a discount.
Chair Tisdale asked if the information on page 14 regarding ridership
numbers was equivalent to boardings.

Chair Tisdale stated that RTD reported that in 2017 the agency had 101
million boardings and was projecting, in any of the options, to significantly
fall short of that number.
Ms. McKillop stated that data reports a 1% to a 1.5% decrease in ridership
every year.
Chair Tisdale stated that the Board was interested in the public comments.
Director Archueta asked if the agency would consider changing the fare
increase timing to every five years rather than every three years.
Director Walker stated that he looked at the way these options as a
household benefit and that he did not agree that it was RTD’s mission to
increase ridership but rather to provide the needs to the customers. He
expressed concern that ridership loss would resulted in service cuts and
eliminating discounts to pay for discounts would hurt a lot of riders that
would not qualify for the low in come pass. He asked if the cost of gas was
included in the model.
Mr. Washington explained that gas was not included and the study was a
sensitivity to price model.
Director Walker stated that gas, parking, and transit oriented development all
impact ridership.
Director Hoy stated that all options showed that when the agency gave
something away, the fares increased and it shows that someone else pays
for someone else’s fare. He added that the person who pays the cash fare
was paying for someone’s discounted fare. He asked how the 70% youth
discount was calculated.
Mr. Washington explained that it was calculated at 70% discount off of the
base fare.
Director Hoy stated that, as a director of a suburb, he would not underwrite
the Denver Public School district because children that go to school in other

areas do not take the RTD bus. He added that means that the people in the
suburbs subsidizes the urban areas. He stated that he was surprised that
there was not an option 4 that was just a fare increase and that every
option that had a fare increase there was a new discount and that the pass
program was tied to increasing the fares.

Director Hoy agreed with Director Anderson and stated that RTD was not a
social agency but a bus company and responsible for moving people. He
added that was not an RTD decision was who should receive discounted
fares and that it was RTD’s decision to give a great service to all the district.
Directory Hoy stated that the issue with the programs was that someone
would pay more money to give somebody else a free ride and that it was
taking money from A to give it to B, and the taxpayers all pay more.
Mr. Washington stated that the 10 cent difference in Alternative 2 and 3
was to allow the low income program to not have a cap on the amount of
discounted fare revenue to be purchased for low income individuals and was
not to pay for a discounted youth fare.
Director Catlin asked to see more information on the cost to implement any
of the alternatives or similar programs and to have the in formation available
for the public.
Ms. McKillop explained that was being worked on and would be provided.
Director Catlin expressed concern that RTD was presenting the PPWG
alternatives to the public at the same time as making service changes.
Director Menten agreed with Director Hoy and stated that she believed that
ridership was decreasing because of time. She stated that RTD should get
rid of low discount fares and should keep the ECO pass and flex pass.
Director Menten stated the Board members were to be the stewards of the
taxpayers’ money.

• 2018 1st Quarter Performance Measure Report
Ms. McKillop asked if there were any question regarding the 1st Quarter
Performance Measure Report that was included in the Board packet. She

goals except in ridership, fare revenue, and operator headcount.

• March 2018 Monthly Financial Status Report

• Quarterly Investment Report
Ms. McKillop stated that the agency investments were performing well and
the rising interest rates had resulted in an estimated few million dollar
increase. She added that the report included new charts that show the
benchmark for earnings and the agency’s benchmarks were ahead of the
earning curve.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten asked where the agency would take money from reserves to pay
for the betterments for other entities and when the Board would receive a report on
the local matching amounts for these projects.
Ms. McKillop stated was working on the report.

the Motion:

Other Matters
Chair Tisdale suggested that meals for the Directors and staff required to attend
meetings of the Board be served on the third floor of the Blake Street building,
rather than in the Boardroom, referred to internally as R, T, & D. He offered several
reasons for doing so, stating that the food would not appear on camera during the
recorded meetings, that the food could be seen as distracting to the viewing and
visiting public, and that Directors might be self-conscious eating during meetings
knowing that they were being recorded. He said he had made it a point to eat before
Tuesday night’s meeting to avoid eating on camera.
Director Deadwyler said that she had always been uncomfortable eating in front of
the public in the Boardroom. She said she fully endorsed moving the meals to the
third floor.
Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed and said she felt strange eating in front of others. She
asked whether staff would eat downstairs.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that staff would
also eat on the third floor. She said that the Directors could eat in their own offices
on occasions when the conference room was unavailable.
Director Lubow said she appreciated the ability to eat as the meetings started,
because she had a tendency to be late, but she agreed that the appearance would
be better if meals were served upstairs.
Chair Tisdale said that some sort of accommodation could be devised for Directors
who ran late.
Director Deadwyler said that serving food on the third floor would also give close
access to a microwave.
Ms. McManus said that the food would not be left out until the end of the meeting
or meetings.
Director Walker said he agreed with the proposal. He said he usually tried to eat
before the meetings, because he did not like the optics of eating in front of others.
He said that guests from the public took time off from work in order to attend
meetings and would likely have to delay eating dinner themselves. He said he would

be fine stopping meals altogether, except for those provided to staff required to
attend meetings.
Director Menten said she had no comment.

General Manager Genova said that the rules were changed so that security
personnel were allowed to eat the food, so long as they were not eating while
carrying out their duties.
Chair Tisdale said he had neglected to inform the committee that he had spoken
with General Manager Genova about that change. He said the problem had been
addressed and resolved.
Ms. McManus said that the Board Office had previously shared pizzas and boxed
lunches with security personnel, but she said that foods that could potentially cause
illness if not properly stored were not shared.
Chair Tisdale said the committee would need a motion to adopt this policy.
Director Lubow asked whether the rest of the Board should be included in the
decision.
Chair Tisdale said the policy needed to be addressed immediately, but he said the
other members could provide feedback.
Director Deadwyler suggested that a memo could be sent out, but she said the
change should not present a problem.
Chair Tisdale said that the change would only apply to meals served before
committee meetings, as meals preceding Board meetings were already served on the
third floor. He said a better way to phrase the motion would be to state that the
serving of meals prior to committee meetings would now follow same model as
meals served at Board meetings.

Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the
motion to allow for a change in
Board procedure for the serving of
meals.
Director Folska, Ph.D., seconded
the motion.

Vote on
the Motion:

The motion passed with 5 in favor
and 0 opposed.

Director Lubow said she was surprised and saddened to hear about the late Mayor
Steve Hogan. She asked whether his passing would have an effect on RTD, given
that Mayor Hogan was a great supporter of the agency.
General Manager Genova said that RTD had a good relationship with the
management and staff of the City of Aurora. He said he was planning on attending
Mayor Hogan’s memorial services.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said she would attend as well.
Chair Tisdale noted that he was in Aurora the previous evening to attend auditions
for persons interested in appearing in segments regarding the R Line, which would
air on the local public access station. He said he had suggested the idea of such
programming to Mayor Hogan the previous year. He said the number of people
auditioning was evidence of the fact that everyone in Aurora was invested in the
continued development and success of the R Line.
Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that the R Line featured prominently in the City of
Aurora’s marketing materials.
Director Deadwyler said she wanted to follow up on an earlier discussion about
compensating individuals inconvenienced by the recent shut down of the A Line.
She said one gentleman in particular had missed being able to attend a baseball
game, for which he had paid a large amount of money.
General Manager Genova said that the agency responded to the gentleman via the
General Manager’s Response (GMR) process. He said the agency’s policy was to not
reimburse passengers for their losses, and he said that other transit agencies
followed that policy as well, as did other organizations such as taxi companies and
network transportation companies. He said that Denver Transit Partners (DTP) had
responded in a similar fashion. He said that the policy was the agency’s stance
unless the Board wanted staff to reevaluate.
Director Deadwyler said she thought the agency should reevaluate its policy. She
said the agency should determine what was reimbursable, and she stated the man
who missed the ballgame had lost $600 from having been stuck on the train for
three hours. She said airlines gave free tickets to inconvenienced passengers, and
she said that doing nothing would be bad for the agency’s reputation.

Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tisdale said that the motion passed unanimously and stated that he would
speak to another matter regarding motions later on in the meeting. He asked if any
Directors had other matters to discuss before the General Manager presented his
updates.

6.D

Director Menten said she would personally worry about guaranteeing service on
RTD’s system. She said that there were many examples of people who would seek
reimbursements and that a missed run on a bus could lead to a person missing a job
interview, which could result in the potential loss of thousands of dollars. She said
she was concerned where that policy would lead.

Chair Tisdale suggested that staff check with the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) and its committees to see whether relevant information had
been gathered by other agencies across the country.
Director Lubow said the agency’s response felt rude but acknowledged that
reimbursing inconvenienced passengers could lead to a slippery slope. She said she
would urge staff to investigate how this was dealt with elsewhere, and she stated
there must be a way to address similar situations in a way that felt less abrupt. She
said that, if nothing else, the agency could send an apology email.
Ms. McManus said that RTD responded to all of the people who contacted the
agency.
Chair Tisdale noted that the agency did not collect contact information as of the
time of the incident, but he stated that staff responded if the passengers reached
out.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether the passengers were given new tickets.
General Manager Genova said they were given new tickets in some cases.
Chair Tisdale said that felt like an appropriate response.
Director Lubow asked whether it would be possible to give passengers who missed
flights a 10-ride fare coupon book.
General Manager Genova said that the Customer Care department typically gave out
a few free ride coupons to the affected people if the agency did not perform
properly.
Director Lubow raised a point of procedure and said she had always felt
uncomfortable that committee members were allowed to speak during committee
meetings before non-committee members. She said it had always bothered her that
non-members spoke last.
Chair Tisdale said he was always open to whatever the committee decided. He said
his approach had been to try to give accord to the committee members first.

Director Deadwyler said the reimbursements should be discretionary.

6.D

Director Deadwyler said that the agency should have some sort of discretionary
budget to reimburse persons who could prove a monetary loss. She said she did not
feel that everyone should be reimbursed, such as those simply inconvenienced by a
bus running late. She said that, if a person could prove a loss of dollars, the agency
and DTP would be held accountable and would put people first because of having to
pay. She said her concern was for fare-paying passengers, and she said that they
might not have incurred losses if they were allowed to leave the train. To address
Director Lubow’s comment, she said that persons not on the committee should
speak last. She said she had been in enough committees of which she was a
member but was required to speak last.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said she felt Director Deadwyler’s point about reimbursement
was a valid one. She said that weather delays were one thing. She stated that those
who incurred a loss should be required to prove their monetary loss. She said she
was tired of hearing that things break, and she added that the train was relatively
new and that DTP had been operating for decades. She said the way DTP responded
made them seem like deer in headlights. She asked why DTP did not think to
remove the passengers first, and she said she was appalled.
Director Menten said that, having owned an auto shop, she knew that things would
break, new or not. She said the reason RTD did not offer reimbursements was the
same reason car manufacturers did not cover the cost of towing. She said that the
problem was one of process. She stated that such issues would continue, and she
reiterated that she did not want the agency to try to guarantee a public service. She
said such a guarantee would cost the agency, and she said she would be more
concerned with the person who missed a job interview as a result of a dropped run.
She said that people were focused on the train but noted that similar instances
happened with buses as well.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she regularly requested reimbursement from utility
providers at times when they were unable to provide their services.
Director Menten said there was a difference between giving passengers a credit and
a check.
Director Deadwyler said that everything broke down. She said that the highway
patrol would not leave her sitting on the side of the road if her car broke down, and
she said that similarly people should not have been left sitting on trains. She said
only those who could prove a monetary loss should be reimbursed.
Chair Tisdale reiterated that the request to staff was to compile information from
other states or districts to help the Board address certain situations where people
were unable to access alternate means of transportation for extended periods. He

Director Walker said he was not in favor of giving people money for lost wages, and
he asked where the line was between people between who were directly and
indirectly affected. He said there were risks with everything people do.

6.D

said that, when buses or trains break down, the agency was usually able to provide
alternate transportation. He said that the information gathered from other districts
would help the Executive Committee’s further discussion, which could then be sent
back to committee for potential action.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether operators have the discretion to give
inconvenienced passengers additional tickets if they were approaching the expiration
of their passes.
General Manager Genova said that, under certain circumstances, operators or street
supervisors had the discretion to issue a transfer or a free ride coupon.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that the instance in which passengers had to be
evacuated from the top of a bridge would be a similar situation.
General Manager Genova said that that situation was different. He said there was no
power in the overhead line, which meant that a rescue train could not be brought in.
He said that commuter rail trains featured level boarding, whereas passengers would
have to step down from light rail vehicles. He said that the preferred option for
reaching a stranded train would be the use of a rescue train, and he noted that rightof-way evacuations were not preferred because of the potential hazards. He said he
was not defending the time required for DTP to deliver those passengers back to
safety, but he said that the deployment of fire trucks and equipment vehicles was
time-consuming.
Director Menten asked what the agency provided for emergency bathrooms on
trains.
General Manager Genova said the trains had no such provision.
Director Menten asked how passengers relieved themselves.
General Manager Genova said that he knew of one passenger who relieved himself
in the corner of the train.
Director Menten said that the agency should look into providing a five-gallon bucket
with sawdust for emergency situations.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked about an incident that occurred on the W Line earlier in
2018. She said that a customer witnessed a man engaging in an indecent act and
reported it to RTD. She said the incident was not handled appropriately and

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow said that Chair Tisdale’s proposal covered too narrow a focus. She
said that the most recent incident fit those criteria but said that another incident
might not fit. She agreed that she would like to see what other agencies do when
people have been terribly inconvenienced.

6.D

Customer Care did not follow up as it should have. Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for
more details on the response.

General Manager Genova said that security had tried unsuccessfully to pull video
from the incident. He said the onboard video system on the train was not working
properly, though the platform cameras were. He said that RTD provided images for
the Golden Police Department, though Golden did not pick up the files from RTD
security command. General Manager Genova said that RTD reached out to the Chief
of Police in Golden about the incident and that the agency had since changed its
practices, so that security command would contact the local police jurisdiction if
footage was not retrieved within 24 hours. Regarding light-rail vehicle cameras, he
said that the manufacturer of the vehicles, Siemens, would not allow RTD to
upgrade the video components without contract amendments. He said staff was
trying to standardize video on light-rail vehicles. He noted that video systems
upgrades had been deferred due to their cost but were included in the midterm
financial plan.
Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that General Manager Genova had spoken with the
customer, and she asked how long the agency would wait for law enforcement.
General Manager Genova said that security would pull video immediately after a
known incident. He said law enforcement would be contacted within 24 hours if
they did not retrieve the footage.
Director Deadwyler said that customers who experience security incidents become
frustrated when RTD cannot provide additional information. She suggested that a
special section of the call center could be dedicated to providing comprehensive
information.
Chair Tisdale noted that the RTD Transit Watch app was available and would allow
for users to capture and report incidents and communicate in real time with security
personnel.
Director Deadwyler asked if the agency should refer customers to the app.
General Manager Genova said that the agency made people aware of the app’s
availability. He said that, in addition to the features mentioned by the Chair, users
could both record videos of events in progress and place a call to security.
Chair Tisdale said that he had mentioned the app to many people. He said he was
appalled by the number of women who reported they were not comfortable riding
transit services due to the perceived security risks.

Packet Pg. 56

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tisdale said that the incident was the subject of a GMR and had been
addressed. He said the customer had been contacted and was satisfied with the
resolution of the incident.

6.D

Director Menten said that the Golden Police Department did not participate in the
security program wherein members of law enforcement served as auxiliary transit
security officers. She asked how best to share information between police
departments.

Ms. McManus reminded the committee that there were two technical workshops on
transit apps that were scheduled for the following week. She said that RTD security
personnel would not be in attendance but could share with attendees how to
download the Transit Watch app.
Director Folska, Ph.D., referring to the incident discussed earlier, said that the
person affected was an adult woman, and she asked what would have happened if
the person was a child. She said she was confronted with all manner of incidents
when she was a young transit rider, which could be terrifying. She said that, if this
adult woman’s report fell through the cracks, she was concerned what young
people could expect to encounter.
General Manager Genova said that the agency required robust design criteria, with
many layers of security, and he said improvements were made every year.
Chair Tisdale said that he and the General Manager had discussed the incident
several times and was comfortable with the solution. He said the key was continual
communication.
Director Folska, Ph.D., said that the Transit Watch app should be included in the
safety briefing.
Chair Tisdale said that was a wonderful idea.
General Manager Genova said that he had presented the agency’s annual FasTracks
briefing to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) the previous day.
He said he had shared his talking points via email to the full Board. He said that the
most interesting item he covered concerned the grade-crossing verifications of the A
Line. He said that RTD and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) staff had
field-verified eight of the 11 crossings on the A Line, and he added that the CPUC
staff was filing paperwork to include those eight crossings on the CPUC agenda. He
stated RTD had filed corollary paperwork and was monitoring the progress closely.
He said the reason the other three crossings had not been field-verified was due to
signal traffic controlling.
Director Deadwyler asked which three crossings had not passed field-verification.
General Manager Genova said he would report back but knew one of them to be the
Quebec crossing. He said his hope was that those three crossings would be tested
the following week and that, if they were to pass, the next step would be to add

Packet Pg. 57

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that police departments had ways of sharing.

those crossings to the CPUC agenda as well. He said at that point RTD could
provide notice of the removal of the grade crossing attendants following the public
outreach agreed to in the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) plan, for which the
longest notification window was seven days. He said that the grade crossing
attendants could be removed from the crossings following CPUC notification to that
effect. Regarding the quiet zone process, he said that RTD was sending paperwork
to regulators describing the agency’s description of its process to meet the constant
warning times required by the FRA, though he noted the FRA’s definition of
“constant warning time” was not straightforward. He said that the notice of intent
to establish quiet zones was submitted much earlier and that the current paperwork
was indication of the agency’s desire to proceed to the next step. General Manager
Genova said that the agency would have to apply for a waiver if the FRA were to
determine that the system did not meet the requirements for constant warning time,
but he was hopeful that would not be necessary. Regarding the G Line, he said the
field testing would hopefully begin the following week, but he noted the agency was
waiting to hear from the FRA on the schedule. He added that the testing along the G
Line could be completed during daylight hours, as opposed to the A Line testing,
which had to be done during non-revenue hours in the middle of the night.
Chair Tisdale said that it was important to share this information with everyone in
the region and that they would want to know what the outreach would involve.
General Manager Genova said that the outreach would involve notices to schools,
news releases, and public service announcements to jurisdictions.
Director Deadwyler said that her biggest concern was for the three locations that did
not pass. She said that the Quebec crossing was close to the constituents who had
been the most vocal about their concerns. She asked what was being done.
General Manager Genova responded that staff was doing everything possible to
address those crossings and that the fix should be relatively quick. He said the
system was being adjusted and that the necessary parts were on order.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if the agency could inquire about the FRA’s
interpretation of constant warning time before the FRA’s determination was made.
General Manager Genova said that staff had made inquiries. He said staff felt that
the current design met the FRA’s intent.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what the go live schedule might be.
General Manager Genova said it would not be clear until testing had been
performed. He said the next step was getting through the grade crossing verification
and testing. He said staff had submitted a concurrent request to allow multiple trains
to run on the G Line for testing purposes, as the current limit was set two trains for
the entire line. He added that, following approval of the grade crossing tests and the

removal of the train limit, the next phase was the system demonstration period, and
he said that the DTP contract stated that period was set at 21 days.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether this would be a six-month process.

Chair Tisdale said that the agency would like to see an opening by Independence
Day.
Director Deadwyler mentioned that Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, had sent a potential news alert about an incident in which vehicles
had inappropriately stopped inside of the crossing gate arms as a train was
approaching. She asked what the agency was doing to educate people.
General Manager Genova said the motorists were not paying attention, violated the
stop signs, and stopped in the wrong place.
Director Deadwyler said that the area within the crossing gates must have been
sizeable if it could accommodate two vehicles.
Chair Tisdale said they ran the red lights in order to get into the area beyond the
crossing gates.
General Manager Genova agreed and said the vehicles were too late entering into
the crossing. He said he reviewed the video of the incident, and the flashing lights at
the gates were behind the vehicles, indicating that the motorists must have seen
them and ignored them. He said that motorists often start to proceed through
crossing gates as soon as the arms go up, despite the fact that the red lights are still
flashing.
Director Folska, Ph.D., recalled an incident in 2010 when a man was killed because
he went around the crossing gate arms after the first train had passed and was
killed as a second train came from the opposite direction. She said that the gate
arms often came down for multiple trains.
General Manager Genova noted that RTD employed signs to warn of the approach of
a second train, whereas most systems did not display such signage.
Chair Tisdale said that there were systems in place to give protections and that,
despite those systems, there were people who would not abide by the rules.

Packet Pg. 59

General Manager Genova said it would not take six months. He said that, after the
system demonstration process, staff would petition the FRA to add the G Line to the
waiver that addressed the A Line. He stated the process would take a couple of
months, but he said he was not comfortable setting a date until the test data was
available.

Chair Tisdale said that he had spoken with Rolf Asphaug, RTD General Counsel,
about the practice of reading in full motions to approve recommended actions. Chair
Tisdale said Mr. Asphaug indicated that Directors were under no obligation to read
the entire motion and could instead give an introductory summary of the verbiage.
He said that motions were typically read in full as a general rule, but in practice, in
the case of a particularly long recommended action, Directors could simply offer a
motion that would describe the action.

General Manager Genova said that the document before the committee was
in the same format as the previous year’s document. He said each goal was
identified, and the categories of performance were listed under each goal.

He noted that, in order to have achieved expectations, the he would have to
meet each element under the broader goal, though he would be rated as
needing improvement if he were to fail to achieve any single element of the
“achieved goal” criteria. He stated that there were five strategic priorities
included in the document, whereas in previous years the General Manager
was evaluated on three task goals. He said no changes were made to the
core goals themselves.

Committee Chair Walker said the committee would let General Manager
Genova present his goals first, and in doing so, he could possibly address
some of the things that Director Menten sought to change. He asked
Director Menten the goals to which she would propose changes.
Director Menten said that her proposed changes were highlighted on the
documents she distributed.
Committee Chair Walker suggested that the General Manager should go
through all of the goals first, at which point the committee could discuss
changes. He asked whether the General Manager should review the core
goals.
Chair Tisdale said that it might be beneficial to set the table first.
Director Deadwyler said that, because the goals were the same as in
previous years, it would make more sense to look at the modifications first.
Chair Tisdale suggested that the committee review all of the core and task
goals and then discuss modifications.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, asked the
General Manager whether any of the elements underneath the core goals
had changed.
General Manager Genova replied that he had made no changes.
Committee Chair Walker said that the committee would discuss the tasks
goals.
General Manager Genova stated that Task Goal #1, Enhance Safety and
Security, was the same bullet that was discussed during the joint Board/SLT
strategic planning retreat in March 2018. He said his proposed review
criteria under the “achieved goal” were: Fostering a safety culture,
continuing with the requirement for a safety core goal for all employees,
reporting of on-the-job injury data, introducing safety roadshows, initiating a
safety audit of bus operations, increasing safety presence; and initiating live

Director Menten noted that she would suggest changes to certain goals at
the appropriate time during the committee meeting.

6.E

video capability on buses. He noted that he would need improvement if he
were to fail on any one of those elements.
Director Menten said she thought live video capability was already available
on buses.

Chair Tisdale summarized that this was a change from recorded video
capabilities to a live video system.
General Manager Genova explained that security would be able to see a live
view in the in command center if they became aware of an incident. He said
that, with the exception of the 29 newly purchased vehicles, the current
light rail vehicles would need a complete hardware change to add live-view
capabilities, whereas the buses required changes to existing network
connectivity rather than hardware.
Director Menten stated that the goals were purposed partly on driving the
budget.
General Manager Genova clarified that whatever the Board adopted would
drive the budget.
Director Menten asked the cost of the added patrols and the live video
system.
General Manager Genova said the live-video capabilities would run $250,000
to $500,000 per year. He said the agency was looking at ways to package
the purchase of all cellular data for the agency, not just for security, which
would be more cost effective.
Director Menten asked whether there would be any additional cost for
subcontractors for the additional patrols.
General Manager Genova said that was a possibility, though he said the cost
would depend on the Board’s wishes. He stated that additional resources
would be deployed on the bus side based on available data. He said that
additional dollars would be helpful if the Board wanted to make
improvements to the patrols and that the estimated cost for adding transit
patrols to certain bus routes would run under $500,000. He indicated that
increasing RTD’s security presence by placing an officer on every light rail
train was a priority, particularly because there had been an increase in recent
incidents. He said the cost would be $1.5 million annually to add an officer
Packet Pg. 65

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that video recordings were logged on buses
and, in the event of a known incident, transmitted to a repository via Wi-Fi
once the buses returned to the shop. He said that security could not see into
buses or light rail trains in real time, though he said this capability was
available on commuter rail trains.

6.E

to every train and that the security presence could be phased in, though he
said he would push the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) to finance the
initiative.

General Manager Genova said that the agency operates two-car, three-car,
and four-car train consists and that an officer would be added to each
consist. He said that another benefit of having officers committed to certain
light rail lines was a sense of ownership, as seen on the commuter rail lines.
He also said the officers would get to know the patrons, and he stated that
fare inspection approached 100% on commuter rail.
Director Deadwyler said that the goal stated the security presence would be
increased but not to a specific level. She asked whether a 50% increase
would be appropriate.
General Manager Genova said that some kind of qualifier could be added.
Committee Chair Walker said he had conversations about goal setting with
Dennis Yaklich, Marketing Research Manager, and Lou Cripps, Senior
Manager of Asset Management. He said that the goals were being set
without being tied in to the budget and suggested that the questions being
asked could better be served later on as the 2019 budget was taking shape.
Director Mihalik said it was understood that the goals were all dependent
upon the Board’s approval.
Director Deadwyler said she understood but reiterated that she felt the goal
was vague. She asked whether the goal could be scratched out later if it
was determined that the budget would not allow for an increase in security.
Chair Tisdale said that was his question as well.
Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that might
be her question as well. She said that the committee would approve the
goals, and the finance staff would then set the budget to be responsive to
those goals. She said she wanted to clarify that that process was occurring
at that time and that a decision needed to be made. She said that the
finance staff would alert the committee if any goal could not be worked into
the budget.
Chair Tisdale said that Ms. McManus was correct. He said it would help if
the goal contained some sort of metric, which would then indicate how
much the attainment of that goal would likely cost and would allow the
agency to determine whether funds were available. He stated that the goalsetting process needed to sync with the budget process. He suggested that
Packet Pg. 66

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Tisdale asked whether General Manager Genova meant he would add
an officer to every train or to every train consist.

6.E

the goal be set somewhat ambiguously at first and that numbers could be
plugged in later on.

General Manager Genova suggested that a number be inserted during the
goal-setting process in the committee rather than revisiting the goal later on.
General Manager Genova said that the cost of increasing security presence
on light rail by 50% in 2019 would be $750,000.
Committee Chair Walker said he was concerned about setting conflicting
goals or setting goals for which there was not enough money to accomplish.
General Manager Genova said he was cognizant of the budgetary
considerations during the drafting of the goals each year. He said that only a
limited amount of money was available for any of the goals, and he
mentioned that five strategic priorities were identified during the joint
Board/SLT strategic planning retreat, which he said would impact the budget
and cause the agency to spread out the available funds among the five
priorities.
Director Deadwyler said that was why the metric was important to her.
Director Mihalik said that the items under discussion, the approval of funding
for an increase in security presence and the approval of funding for live
video on buses, seemed to him to be Board goals, meaning that the Board
would have to approve the funding. He recognized that there was work that
went along with implementing those programs.
General Manager Genova said that staff needed to consider the budget
during the project prioritization process, which required them to shift a lot of
objectives. He said the midterm budget was practically a one-year plan. He
added that the goals of the General Manager were the goals of the
organization, and he said that, while he himself was evaluated on the goals,
the goals were the agency’s way of setting targets to accomplish.
Director Menten asked about the language regarding safety being a goal for
salaried employees. She also asked about safety roadshows for represented
employees.
General Manager Genova responded that the represented employees were
not evaluated as salaried employees were. He said safety was a core goal

Packet Pg. 67

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler said her concern was that in years past Directors stated
at the General Manager’s end-of-year review that they were not aware that
the General Manager had performed certain tasks. She said that she did not
want the committee to forget to plug in a number at a later date, and she
stated the General Manager’s performance could not be measured without a
metric.

6.E

for all employees and that safety was considered in everything the agency
did.
Ms. McManus said that a safety goal was added to all employee
performance evaluations in 2017.

General Manager Genova said that the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) issued
comprehensive rules regarding state safety oversight for light rail, but he
noted that no such rules existed for bus operations. He said the complete
oversight cycle took three years to complete. He stated that he wanted to
add the same type of audit process to the bus system, using the same
methodology and systems as with the light rail system.
Director Menten asked whether RTD’s auditors would oversee the program.
General Manager Genova said that Safety, Security, and Asset Management
would handle it.
Director Menten said that the committee needed to cover as much ground as
possible within a reasonable amount of time during the meeting.
Regarding the timeline of events for the review of the General Manager’s
goals, Committee Chair Walker noted that the General Manager would come
back to present changes on the June 26th meeting for the committee’s
approval. He said the committee would be in communication with the
General Manager to ensure that the committee was satisfied with the
changes to the goals.
General Manager Genova said that was true, unless the committee came to
a consensus during that same committee meeting.
Chair Tisdale said he wanted to go back to a broader point. He said the
strategic priorities had been expanded from three to five and that one could
visualize the goals on a pie chart with smaller pie pieces than in years past.
In reality, though, he said that it was not so simplistic, because certain
strategic priorities flowed into one another, and there were certain elements
under one goal that impacted others, such as fiscal sustainability and asset
management. He said he wanted to emphasize that point because it
impacted the budget, and he stated that the concept that spending $100 to
implement a given goal would necessarily cause a subsequent reduction of
$100 available for other goals was inaccurate.
Director Deadwyler said she agreed with that thought. She said that the
committee was determining outcomes, regardless of whether the goals
overlapped. She reiterated that the first element regarding live video on
Packet Pg. 68

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked for clarification on the review element involving the
safety audit program for bus operations.

6.E

buses was very specific, but the element regarding increased security
presence was less accurate. She said that determining whether the General
Manager exceeded expectations required specificity.
Committee Chair Walker asked if the General Manager had a number in
mind.
General Manager Genova said that he did not but could insert one.

General Manager Genova said that he would specifically address the secondto-last bullet, regarding “incrementally optimized service through the
runboard process to bring balance regarding service delivered and headcount
available”.
Chair Tisdale said this sounded like right-sizing.
General Manager Genova said that he saw that term as being negative and
preferred the term “service optimization”. He said the agency was faced
with large vacancies in operator headcounts, which was the cause of
dropped runs on the current service plan. He stated that adjustments had
been made to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to help improve
recruitment and retention, though he noted the agency had historically never
been at or below 90% headcount. He said the problem needed to be
addressed from both sides, meaning that the agency needed to look at the
areas that were meeting service standards and to balance out the services
offered with the human capital available. He said the “exceeded
expectations” criterion would mean restoring the headcount to historical
levels.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the measurements had been used as
evaluative criteria in the past.
General Manager Genova said they were new. He said similar numbers had
been used under another goal the previous year, but with higher
percentages.
General Manager Genova said that the reduction of mandating was also a
goal criterion, and he noted that mandating was one of the biggest issues
behind the entire goal, specifically increasing human capital but at the same
time making sure service was being adjusted and directing staff to reduce
mandating. He said about 70-75% of the operators were being mandated,
most of whom were mandated four or five times per month. He said the goal
was to reduce those numbers to 50% of operators being mandated no more
than twice per month.

Packet Pg. 69

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker moved on to Task Goal #2, regarding service and
human capital.

6.E

Director Menten asked whether the Board could see the chart that depicted
the agency’s historical headcount.
General Manager Genova said he would provide that, as well as information
on mandating.
Committee Chair Walker said it was his understanding that having 100%
headcount was not optimal, because some operators wanted to work extra
shifts.

Chair Tisdale asked whether the General Manager’s goal met or exceeded
any reductions in mandating specified in the CBA.
General Manager Genova said the CBA contained several provisions
designed to reduce the amount of mandating. He said there was no specific
number or benchmark because there were many variables. Moving on to
Task Goal #3, General Manager Genova said that the “achieved goal” criteria
were the same as the previous year’s.
Director Menten said that one of the review criteria dealt with minimizing
debt. She suggested a change to one of the General Manager’s core goals
that would require him to “aggressively pay down debt”.
General Manager Genova said that he could look into Director Menten’s
request.
Committee Chair Walker asked what “aggressive” meant as the term related
to the General Manager’s goal.
Director Menten said that the committee wanted SMART (meaning specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-limited) goals.
General Manager Genova said he would speak to Heather McKillop, Chief
Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration, to make sure the proposed change to the goal could make a
meaningful statement.
Director Broom noted that the Board approved all issuance of debt. He
stated that bonds were callable but featured premiums if called early, which
would require the agency to budget the funds to accommodate that early
call. He said he was trying to determine how the General Manager would
have much influence on the agency’s debt going up or down. Director Broom
said the General Manager proposed items in the budget, such as buying a
certain number of vehicles through certificates of participation (COPs), and

Packet Pg. 70

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that the headcount for certain positions
fluctuated month by month.

6.E

said that refunding opportunities were a function of the marketplace. He said
debt was typically reduced during refunding opportunities.
General Manager Genova noted that certain refunding opportunities were no
longer available due to changes in tax law.
Director Menten suggested that efficiencies could be found in agency
expenditures that would go toward debt payments.

Director Menten said that her proposed change to the goal would require
efficiency savings to be placed into a reserve.
Chair Tisdale said the decision of what to do with the money was more of a
policy decision. He agreed that paying down debt was a good idea, but he
said what happened to savings was up to the Board, rather than a task or a
core goal for the General Manager.
Director Broom said that most likely opportunities were when sales tax
exceeded what was budgeted. He said that the Board should determine
what to do with surplus funds.
Director Menten asked whether debt reduction should be a goal for the
General Manager.
Director Broom said the disposition of surplus funds should be a decision of
the Board rather than that being responsibility of the General Manager.
Committee Chair Walker said that the requirement for the General Manager
could be included, but he said that doing so could restrict the use of funds
for some other beneficial purpose if there were a mandate to pay down debt.
Director Menten disagreed.
Committee Chair Walker said that every debt payment minimized debt.
Director Deadwyler agreed with Director Broom. She said that the General
Manager would meet his goal if he were to pay down the agency’s debt.
She said she did not agree with removing that requirement.
General Manager Genova said that he took the committee’s direction as
being to strike Director Menten’s suggestion for the addition of a criterion
regarding the aggressive reduction of debt
Director Menten said the decision to reduce debt never came from the Board
but rather was decided by staff.
Packet Pg. 71

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that either an efficiency or use of a reserve
could satisfy that criterion.

6.E

Director Deadwyler said that the Board was always told where the money
would go.
General Manager Genova said that staff presented recommendations, but
the Board could always direct staff to do something else.

Director Deadwyler said that the Directors did not dispute what staff told
them.
Committee Chair Walker said that not every Director felt that way.
Director Broom said one would hope that would be the case. He said staff
knew the best interests of the organization.
Director Deadwyler said that minimizing debt should not even be a question,
because that was part of the staff’s job.
Committee Chair Walker said that anything above and beyond should be up
to the Board.
Director Mihalik asked whether there was a mechanism to measure how the
General Manager could exceed expectations by reducing debt.
Committee Chair Walker said that the Board could require the General
Manager to reduce debt by 10%, but he said he did not know whether such
a number was achievable.
Director Mihalik said that he agreed with the idea of divorcing the reduction
of debt from the determination of where the money would go. He again
asked if there was a mechanism in place and if one was warranted.
Committee Chair Walker said there was a mechanism in that staff saw
opportunities for the agency to identify uses for reserves. He said the
agency recently chose not pay down other debt in order to pay the
operators.
Director Mihalik asked for a measurement rather than a mechanism.
Committee Chair Walker said that adding a measurement might make the
review criterion out of the realm of achievable.
Director Mihalik said that was a fair point, but he said he was just trying to
get the discussion back to the original question.
Packet Pg. 72

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker said that staff recommendations were just
recommendations and that the Board could do what it wanted. He said most
Board decisions were in line with staff recommendations.

6.E

Director Menten said that she would like to add “increase reserves” as a
review criterion. She said that the reserves were used twice during the
committee meeting two days earlier. She asked whether increasing reserves
was already a review criterion.

Director Menten said that the agency was experiencing an economic peak,
which she said was the appropriate time to increase reserves. She noted the
Board took action two days earlier to spend money from the reserves.
Committee Chair Walker moved on to Task Goal #4.
General Manager Genova said that this goal, transportation transformation,
was a new goal for the agency. He said this was an opportunity for the
agency to look at alternative service delivery approaches or pilot programs
and as examples he noted the State Highway 119 project, the
commencement of the Colfax construction project, the completion of a bus
rapid transit (BRT) study, the identification of first/last mile pilot programs,
the advertisement of requests for proposals (RFPs) for system optimization
and a comprehensive system analysis. Regarding system optimization,
General Manager Genova said that agencies had done this over the years
and had increased ridership by putting resources where the riders were. He
said that the agency could review the entire network to lay out the most
efficient grid, particularly with respect to bus service areas and frequencies.
He said an RFP would be issued and would cost about $1.5 million, and the
turnaround time would be 18 months from the time of the award. He said he
envisioned heavy stakeholder involvement, with working groups working
alongside RTD staff, augmented by public participation and stakeholder
input.
Chair Tisdale said he had hesitation with the last part of the General
Manager’s proposal. He said the notion of having a whiteboarding process,
and the notion of having the public come in without the benefit of guidance
and mentoring from staff, was a scary prospect, and he considered the Pass
Program Working Group to be a parallel. He said the policy derived from the
whiteboarding process could be divisive, similar to the recommendations of
the PPWG, and he suggested that activist groups might become involved. He
said that certain districts would likely see outsize benefits.
General Manager Genova said the point was well taken and the plan would
need to be developed and presented to the Board.

General Manager Genova said he would review the core coals. He said that
handling reserves was part of the budget process and was a policy decision
regarding how best to use the agency’s resources. He said the reserves
could be increased in some years and not in others. He stated that the
agency sought to build reserves both in the annual and midterm budgets.

6.E

Director Hoy said he agreed with what Chair Tisdale had said and stated the
process could be totally out of control.

General Manager Genova noted that former Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations, Bruce Abel, would be working part time and would be
involved in the process. He said that he had perhaps given too broad an
explanation of the whiteboarding process, and he said staff felt the timing
was good to do a comprehensive analysis of system.
Director Broom asked whether the program was in the budget.
General Manager Genova said that it was included in the budget. He said the
project would begin in 2019 and would be an 18-month process, finishing
sometime in 2020, with implementation in 2021. He said a number of
agencies had done this and that some areas, such as Houston, were seeing
increased ridership.
Committee Chair Walker noted that the committee needed to review one
more task goal, at which point Director Menten’s changes could be
considered.
Director Deadwyler said that it sounded as though, by engaging with the
public, the decision-making was being taken away from the Board. She said
there was no specificity. She said she disagreed with the proposal and
questioned whether seeking public involvement would yield useful results.
She said that only activists, not the members of the public who could
provide useful insight, would participate.
General Manager Genova said that her point was taken.
Director Menten asked whether transit vouchers, particularly in areas where
fare subsidies fell outside of acceptable levels, were included in the
discussion about alternate transit options.
General Manager Genova said that the pilot concept might be broader than
that. He said that such a proposal would be getting down to a certain level
of detail not covered by the pilot, and he stated the program might involve
an agreement with the private sector or others for novel approaches, such
as replacing the Call-n-Ride service with a company such as Lyft or doing a
tech layover that would create efficiencies.
Committee Chair Walker said he did not mind big, messy public meetings.
He said he had been involved in some and that good ideas came out. He said

Director Broom suggested that the agency wait until after the buildout of
light rail lines was complete before tearing the system apart. He said new
patrons had recently come on board who needed to become more familiar
with the system.

6.E

that opening up the process did not mean that all of the recommendations
would necessarily be implemented.
General Manager Genova said that the pilot would not be like the PPWG,
where the participants were given principles and guidelines. He said the pilot
would be more process-driven, engaging stakeholders in different ways and
soliciting a good amount of input.

Director Deadwyler asked how participants would gain knowledge if they did
not participate.
Committee Chair Walker said that not all of the participants were agitators.
He said that in the last bullet point under Task Goal #4 contained the phrase
“advertises and awards” in the “achieved goal” language. He said the award
was beyond the General Manager’s control.
General Manager Genova agreed and said that “awards” should be changed
to “recommends”.
Director Menten said that she would have a change later on regarding
grants.
Director Deadwyler suggested a change in the verbiage of the goal, from
“gains” to “obtains”.
Director Broom asked about the Volkswagen settlement.
General Manager Genova said that RTD would be competing with other
transit providers for the available settlement funds. He then proceeded to
Task Goal #5.
Chair Tisdale asked whether the goal was any different from the previous
year.
General Manager Genova said the goal was the same as before.
C. Review committee requested changes to GM Core and Task Goals for 2019
presented by GM Genova
Committee Chair Walker said that, if everyone was amenable, the committee
would take up Director Menten’s suggested changes.
Director Menten said she had sent the committee an email earlier that day
that summarized her proposed changes. She said that the only aspect of
Core Goal #1 regarding the successful delivery of transit services she sought
to change was in the “exceeded expectations” portion. She proposed a

change to require the General Manager to achieve both 90% of performance
measures and the provision of outstanding and noteworthy special services.
Committee Chair Walker asked why Director Menten requested the change.
Director Menten said she expected the agency to provide outstanding and
noteworthy service every day.

Ms. McManus noted that the special events serviced by RTD changed from
year to year.
Chair Tisdale said that he interpreted Director Menten’s suggested change as
applying to the provision of special services only. He said the thing that gave
him pause was that the suggested change was made to the “exceeds
expectations” criteria, but no corollary change was made to the “needs
improvement category. He said the philosophical issue was that, to be rated
as needing improvement, the General Manager needed only to fail on any
one of the “achieved goal” criteria, whereas in order to exceed expectations,
the General Manager would be required to exceed in all of the extra criteria.
He said that, if Director Menten’s suggested change were adopted, he would
suggest a change in which the General Manager would have to fail on all of
the “achieved goal” criteria in order to be rated as needing improvement.
Director Broom said that he had heartburn about special events. He said the
agency was short on operators, and he felt the operators were being
overburdened in order to provide those special services, which was not in
the best long-term interests of the agency.
General Manager Genova said that providing special services was
challenging, especially for impromptu events like marches. He said
stakeholders were not shy about calling their Directors.
Director Deadwyler said she understood Chair Tisdale’s point that, if the
General Manager were to fail on any one evaluation criterion, he would not
be able to exceed expectations.
Chair Tisdale said to miss on any one element would mean that the General
Manager’s performance would need improvement. He noted that Director
Menten had only proposed requiring multiple “exceeds expectations” on
certain goals.
Director Deadwyler said that in her career she had to meet certain goals in
order to receive a bonus. She felt there was nothing wrong with requiring
the General Manager to meet all elements in the “exceeds expectations”
category
Packet Pg. 76

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova asked whether she was specifically referring to
special events, as opposed to regular service, and she said yes.

6.E

Chair Tisdale said his point was about the fairness of such a scenario.
Director Deadwyler said she would discuss the topic with Chair Tisdale at
another time.

General Manager Genova said that special services were delivered in addition
to the regular service. He said the performance measures tracked the
achievement of regular daily service goals, and none of the measurements
accounted for special services.
Director Mihalik asked how much of the special service was mandated.
General Manager Genova responded that much of it was mandated, though
he said the extent would depend on which day an event fell. He said that
providing service for nighttime Broncos games was particularly difficult
because the time during which service was necessary deviated from the
agency’s normal hours of service.
Committee Chair Walker agreed with Chair Tisdale, saying that “achieved”
meant “achieved”, and he said that the attainment of any other goal would
exceed expectations. He said the question was why someone would have to
win a game by four points when one would do. He noted that the General
Manager’s discretionary performance payout was not attached to his
performance rating and would be determined through a separate decision.
Director Menten asked whether what Committee Chair Walker was saying
was that the Board would not use this as a performance measure.
Committee Chair Walker said he would be a no. He clarified that the
committee, rather than the Board, decided on the General Manager’s goals.
Chair Tisdale added that the Board would address any discretionary
performance payout separately and that the committee would not make a
recommendation on the amount.
Director Menten said she would like to leave the item open to the
committee’s next discussion.
Chair Tisdale said he personally thought that Director Menten had good ideas
about additional “exceeds expectations” criteria.
Director Menten said that she did not feel that the two “exceeds
expectations” criteria did not address teambuilding and said they were more

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Mihalik said that he did not want to minimize what it took to deliver
special services, but he said that, if the agency met 90% of performance
measures, the other goals should fall in line.

6.E

outward-facing criteria. She suggested that an internal survey should be
conducted that would assess whether the agency had moved past its silo
issue and whether employees felt they were being listened to, which would
translate to better service.

Chair Tisdale said that Director Menten was suggesting that the General
Manager would need to exceed expectations on element #3, plus either
element #1 or #2. He said she was not contemplating removing the first two
goals. He said that #3 was a legitimate point to be made, that the General
Manager should show that the agency was a cohesive team. Referring to the
earlier discussion, he said that the General Manager should only have to
exceed expectations on one element. He said he did not mind adding another
“exceeds expectations” criterion, which he said would show that the Board
appreciates the leadership of the General Manager.
Committee Chair Walker said he read the change as requiring the General
Manager to achieve all three criteria in order to exceed expectations.
Director Menten said she was not impressed with criterion #1 or #2, but she
said that criterion #3 said something.
Committee Chair Walker said he did not disagree.
Director Mihalik said he agreed with the idea of putting out a survey as long
as it was structured appropriately.
Director Broom said it would depend on how the questions were worded. He
said that he would like to see a baseline before adding the survey to the
General Manager’s goals, because he said he would need to see how the
General Manager improved over time.
Committee Chair Walker said that a baseline would be nice. He noted that
the agency had a salary freeze for years, which would have affected
employees’ responses.
Ms. McManus added that the agency employed surveys on a regular basis,
noting that the last one was done through former employee John Elias.
General Manager Genova said that survey was the last major one issued.
Ms. McManus asked whether there was a schedule for conducting surveys
and how often they were issues. She said there was a considerable cost.

Packet Pg. 78

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova asked whether Director Menten was suggesting
that all of the criteria would need to be met for him to have exceeded
expectations.

6.E

General Manager Genova said that to have a numerical goal without a
baseline would be arbitrary. He said that employees might give negative
feedback because of the amount of an annual raise.

Ms. McManus suggested that the survey could be structured so that the
elements were internal to the departments. She said the high approval rating
of the CBA showed that employees were happy with the process, and she
added that another element might be employee recognition, which she said
the Directors did not really see. She noted that there were employee picnics
and other such functions that the Directors did not regularly attend, and she
noted that the Directors could ascertain the employees’ assessment of the
agency if they were to speak with the employees directly.
Director Broom asked how the rank and file employees would recognize the
Board members.
Ms. McManus said that Directors in the past would visit with employees for
hours. She said she did not feel that a survey would be a good answer,
because, as Director Broom had said, the survey would only generate
negative comments, because the survey would present the employees an
opportunity to give them.
Committee Chair Walker added he did not know how much weight the
survey responses should have, especially when the Board also influenced the
agency. He said the Board should perhaps be part of the survey.
Ms. McManus said that employees volunteered to do tasks for the agency
outside of work hours, which she said showed employee engagement. She
said the agency could be better at communicating what was going on.
Director Menten, speaking to core goal #3, returned to the goal of
aggressively paying off the agency’s debt load. She noted that beefing up
reserves was not in any of the goals. Regarding core goal #4, regarding
equal employment opportunity, she said she had long envisioned requiring
graduation from the disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) and small
business enterprise (SBE) program. She said there were people who wanted
to occupy a privileged position, which she said was not fair. She stated she
would like to see the agency put a graduation requirement in place and
wanted to open up the topic for discussion.
General Manager Genova said that federal rules would not allow such a
requirement.

Packet Pg. 79

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker said the number of responses would also be a
factor.

6.E

Director Menten asked whether the agency’s DBE and SBE for certain
projects were determined solely by the agency or whether they were
federally mandated.

Director Menten said she felt the agency was paying more on contracts and
that the programs were a form of reverse discrimination, which she said she
would discuss with Congressman Perlmutter. Regarding core goal #5, she
said she wanted to add a requirement that the General Manager conduct
quarterly public outreach meetings, to be held at night and on a rotational
basis within the district.
Director Broom said that telephone town halls seemed to get more people
involved than district meetings. He said people would prefer to dial in than
to attend meetings.
Director Menten said that a live video stream could also let people know
more about the agency.
D. Review SMART Goals
Committee Chair Walker said that the committee did not discuss SMART goals
specifically.
Ms. McManus said that the SMART goals were being contemplated in the
committee’s discussion.

E. GM Committee to provide consensus on final goals and recommended action
to bring to the full Board on June 26th
Ms. McManus said that the committee could reconvene on June 5th. She said
that in that meeting the committee could come to consensus on the core goal
changes, after which the General Manager could present his amended goals at a
later date, possibly on June 26th, in order to move forward with a recommended
action to the Board at the June 26th Board Meeting. She asked the General
Manager whether that would give him enough time.
General Manager Genova said that he could make the minor goal changes
discussed by the committee in time for the June 5th meeting and would make
additional changes based on the consensus of the committee.
Ms. McManus reiterated that the committee had not reached consensus. She
suggested that the committee complete its work sooner rather than later in on
account of the budget process.
Director Mihalik asked how much a survey of agency employees would cost.
Packet Pg. 80

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 17, 2018 3:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that the agency set the goals and the Federal
Transit Authority (FTA) concurred and regularly reviewed the agency’s
historical targets. He said the DBE targets applied to projects with federal
funding and SBE was for non-federal projects.

6.E

General Manager Genova said the last one cost between $30,000 and
$50,000. He said it took a lot of effort to get people to respond, and he said
the agency wanted at least a 50% response rate.
Director Menten said that all that was needed was a box and some index cards.
Ms. McManus responded that it depended on what the agency hoped to
achieve from the survey.

Director Menten said even the task goals were up for discussion.

Ms. McManus said that in order to stay on task the committee would have
to reconvene before June 26. She said the committee needed to reach
consensus on the committee’s recommended action to the Board.
Director Broom suggested that the committee could reconvene on June 26 th
prior to the Board Meeting.
Ms. McManus said that the next two weeks would not work and suggested
a tentative plan for June 5th. She reiterated that the General Manager could
not present changes to the goals if the committee did not come to
consensus on the changes to the goals.
Committee Chair Walker said the follow-up meeting should be quick.
General Manager Genova said he would provide a redline version of the
amended goals.

The committee did not vote to move forward with a recommended action at

Retiree Awards
Chair Tisdale noted there were four retirees this month with three in attendance.

Operations, and thanked him for the 18 years of service to RTD. Mr. Genova highlighted
Mr. Abel’s many roles and contributions during his tenure at RTD. He stated that Mr. Abel
started his career in North Carolina as a Transportation Planner and began his career in
Colorado at the Roaring Fork Transportation Agency (RFTA) in Aspen, Colorado. He added
that Mr. Abel was a founding member of Colorado Association of Transit Agencies
(CASTA) and was active with the American Public Transportation Agency (APTA). Mr.
Genova said that Mr. Abel would be continuing at RTD in a part-time capacity as Director

Mr. Abel thanked RTD for the opportunity to serve to the organization and the community.
He reminded attendees of the common theme that retirees have stated, that there were
great people at RTD and a great team of people to work with, and he echoed that
sentiment. Mr. Abel stated that he had been blessed to have been supported and
surrounded by great people his entire time at RTD. He recognized the dedication within all
the departments and contractors that he had worked with over the years. Mr. Abel
thanked the late Cal Marsella, former General Manager (1995 – 2009), for the
opportunities he had afforded him when he started at RTD. He acknowledged Phil
Washington, former General Manager (2009 – 2016), and General Manager Genova for
the continued support that had enabled him to be successful and provided him with great
opportunities. Mr. Abel stated that his tenure at RTD had not been without challenges and
that the flip side of every challenge was that there was an opportunity. He shared a story
from his experience in Austin, Texas, about a project that he was challenged to complete
within 90 days. Mr. Abel quoted Colin Powell, “optimism was a force multiplier” and
stated that while there may be challenges people should focus on the opportunities
because it makes the challenges easier. He thanked the all the people in the agency and
asked them to continue the good work at RTD.
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, introduced Douglas R. Davis,
Light Rail Maintenance Instructor/Supervisor, and stated that it was his honor to present
Mr. Davis with his retirement plaque and expressed the agency’s gratitude for his many
years of service. He stated that Mr. Davis had worked at RTD for the past 16 years and
started in the Maintenance of Way department and then transferred to the Light Rail
Vehicle (LRV) Maintenance department, where he spent many years as an instructor and a
supervisor. Mr. Jensen explained that Mr. Davis was instrumental in setting up and
conducting the first responder training for new corridor openings. He added that Mr. Davis
had built the first of the event recorders for the agency’s older fleet of LRVs, the SD-100s,
which were the first event recorders to be put on any of the RTD fleet and he had also set
up and maintained the tech portal, which is where electro mechanics go to reference parts
of an LRV for instructions, to review Standard Operating Procedures, and other rules
relating to LRV maintenance. Mr. Jensen said, on behalf of RTD, he wished Mr. Davis all
the best in retirement and thanked him for his 16 years of dedication and hard work to
RTD.
Mr. Davis thanked Mr. Jensen and said that there were a lot of people who say that as
soon as they retire they would travel. He explained that he had applied with RTD over the
phone from the Philippines and did not intend travel because he had seen enough of the
world prior to working with RTD. Mr. Davis stated that he had come to Colorado in 2002
and was the first technical trainer for light rail training and that he appreciated everything

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, introduced Jeffrey
Cluphf, Park-n-Ride Construction Manager, and stated he had worked with Mr. Cluphf for
the last 18 years and that he had been a part of the RTD family for 30 years. He added
that Mr. Cluphf believed in RTD, our patrons, and was a dedicated employee. Mr.
Stopplecamp stated that Mr. Cluphf had been a part of RTD before FasTracks, before the
Metro Area Connection (MAC) line, he had worked on most of the Park-n-Ride structures,
and any of the construction that was not attached to a facility or corridor. He added that
Mr. Cluphf had been the Park-n- Ride construction manager for 15 or 16 years and that he
had the honor and privilege of working with him. He added that Mr. Cluphf had touched,
through inspections or supervision, all RTD projects over the last 30 years and thanked
him for his service and value he had brought to the team.
Mr. Cluphf thanked the engineering team and stated that he had been fortunate to work
with many talented individuals at RTD. He added that the engineering department was a
great team and that working for RTD had brought him close to so many people and that
had been like a family. Mr. Cluphf said it had been a pleasure working with all the fine
individuals that make up the RTD staff and thanked everyone at RTD.
Chair Tisdale recognized Luong (Lou) Ha, Manager of Technical Services, for his 28 years
of distinguished service to RTD.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Tisdale stated that the public participation period was open to anyone who wanted
to speak. He explained that elected officials were invited to speak first, and others would
be called in the order they signed up, and then additional speakers would be invited at the
end of the list. He reminded the audience that each speaker was allowed three minutes
and to approach the lectern when called and state their name and address. Chair Tisdale
asked that if any speaker had documentation or reference materials for the Board to give
those materials to the Board staff prior to speaking.
John Bryant, Centennial, District G, stated that he was an active community member and
a daily RTD rider. He said that he had lived in the Smoky Hill neighborhood for over five
years. He thanked the Board for their service and stated the he was on a community board
and understood that it was not an easy task getting requests and dealing with competing
priorities. Mr. Bryant requested that the pending 169L service change, which was a
discontinuation of the stop at at the intersection of Buckley and Crestline, be reconsidered.
He added that he would like to ask that the stop, because Crestline is a main thoroughfare
through both the Smoky Hill and Piney Creek neighborhoods. Mr. Bryant explained that he

Danny Katz, Denver, from the Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG), thanked
the Board for the opportunity to speak and stated that he had come to applaud RTD for
the electric buses that have been deployed. He added that CoPRIG had released a new
report on electric buses and had examined the 50 largest transit agencies around the
country. Mr. Katz explained that in 2016, the latest year from which data was available,
RTD was one of only six agencies that had deployed electric buses on the roads. He added
that RTD had 36 electric vehicles currently operating, which was the most of any transit
agency and was important for the environmental and public health impacts, because buses
oftentimes run through urban denser areas that have more air pollution. Mr. Katz added
that running electric buses made economic sense because over their lifetime they save
approximately $81,000 over some competitor buses. He stated that CoPRIG was proud of
RTD for being a leader and encouraged RTD to continue to realize there was funding
available through the Volkswagen settlement money coming to Colorado for electric buses.
Mr. Katz thanked Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, for speaking at the press
conference about the CoPRIG report. He thanked RTD and encouraged RTD to continue to
be a leader in the country implementing electric buses throughout the district.
David Martin, Denver, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak and thanked General
Manager Genova for his response to the questions that he had presented at the previous
Board meeting. He stated that he was attending to speak again about the University of
Colorado A Line commuter rail train horns. He added that the horns continue and that he
represented approximately 176 residences in the community that endured these train
horns for 2.5 years. Mr. Martin said that he understood that RTD was doing everything to
get the quiet zones implemented and asked for RTD to provide community outreach to
provide an update on the progress. He added that he would like RTD to like to explain to
the neighborhood what was being done to stop the train horns, time frame, and future
plan to implement the quiet zones.
Lindsey Feitz, Lafayette, The Gathering Place, stated that this was her second time
speaking to the Board but that represented a broader body of people from The Gathering
Place, which was Denver's only daytime drop-in center for women, kiddos, and
transgender individuals who were experiencing homelessness and/or poverty. She stated
that she hoped that the Board realized from the numbers of phone calls, the number of
people who have shown up at the meetings, and the 98 people who have signed a petition
that she was going to read, that a low income pass was a pressing issue and something
that was central to the RTD mission in terms of equity. Ms. Feitz read the petition that
stated that The Gathering Place wanted to express support for the RTD Pass Program

had submitted a request through the website and was told that it would be forwarded on
to the Board but said he had come to back up that submission regarding the northbound
stop number 26372 and southbound stop 26359. He thanked the Board for their time.

Working Group's (PPWG) recommendation to create a low income pass program and an
enhanced youth discount pass program which would make public transit affordable,
accessible, and equitable. She added that public transit helped provide unhoused
communities access to warm places to sleep and places to provide food, medical care, and
mental health services. Ms. Feitz reminded the elected members of the RTD Board of their
responsibility to uphold RTD's mission to provide equitable access to all riders and
encouraged the Board to expand the low income pass program to a 50% discount as
opposed to the current working group's recommendation of 40%. She explained that was
critical to providing a more equitable and public transit system for Denver. Ms. Feitz
thanked the Board for their time and said she looked forward to seeing the updates on the
RTD website.
Kristen Seidel, Denver, on behalf of the Denver Women's Collaborative, quoted the
priorities listed on the RTD website, stating that it said, "At RTD, we are stewards of our
riders, our communities, and our environment. We are dedicated to serve the public and
meet the transit needs of our riders and communities." She explained that said to her that
RTD was dedicated to taking care of primary ridership, and that was the agency’s first
investment. Ms. Seidel stated that her taxes and fees were going to RTD as an investment
in RTD priorities and that was why she attended every month, not just to represent the
nine nonprofit organizations the people they serve. She stated that Florence Crittenton
High School in West Denver, that served pregnant women and young moms, and said that
these young women even with all the opportunities that Florence Crittenton provided were
still faced with the barrier of transportation. Ms. Seidel stated that a low income pass, and
child pass would aid in giving these women a better future. She added that the current
discount was with a cap for nonprofit organizations and was not meeting the standard and
made it unaffordable to organizations. She stated that the Board was elected to uphold the
RTD mission to serve the public and to remember that when making decisions.

General Manager's Report
Chair Tisdale asked General Manager Genova to share his report.
General Manger Genova stated that he would begin with an update regarding the
University of Colorado A line and the G line. He explained that RTD had received the
written orders from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and have begun the verification
process. General Manager Genova stated that staff had been out on the University of
Colorado A line with DTP and the Public Utilities Commission staff going through field
verification testing and that the testing had gone very well. He added that at least eight of
the grade crossings had completed the verification process and explained that the grade
crossings, the activation, and the warning times were matching up with what was
approved in the PUC orders and by the Federal Railroad Administration. General Manager
Genova stated that the PUC had filed field verification memos on six crossings: Chambers,
Clayton, Dahlia, Havana, Holly, and Steele and that RTD would file completion and

General Manager Genova addressed the next steps for the quiet zones on the University of
Colorado A line and explained that RTD filed a notice of intent to establish quiet zones with
the Federal Railroad Administration and the notice of intent described the different warning
devices and design to achieve quiet zones. He explained that the FRA would either concur
with all the steps RTD had taken to establish quiet zones or RTD would have to apply for a
waiver, but the process was progressing.
General Manger Genova provided an update on the G Line testing and stated that the G
Line was going through the same field verification testing process, and testing was
expected to progress quickly because it would be done throughout the day and when
completed RTD would work towards removing the grade crossing attendants and
establishing quiet zones. General Manager Genova explained that about a week's worth of
data during the system performance demonstration would be gathered, then RTD would
petition the Federal Railroad Administration to add the G Line to the long-term waiver for
the University of Colorado A Line, and move towards an opening day.
General Manger Genova provided the additional highlights:
 A draft Executive Summary of a FasTracks status report had been provided and was
the first time a comprehensive FasTracks status report tracking progress from the
very beginning of 2004 to the present. The final report would be presented at the
next Planning Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee meeting.
 June 6th – 12th the APTA International Rodeo and Conference would be hosted by
RTD.
General Manager Genova stated that the IPW, formerly called the International Pow Wow,
conference was recently hosted in Denver and brought about 6,000 delegates of travel
writers, buyers, and planners to the city. He said that the conference purchased 4,000 RTD
regional day passes to get from the airport to downtown. He added that he was able to
attend some of the IPW events and received positive feedback about the cleanliness of the
system, the efficiency, the ease of use, and about the people that work for RTD.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for clarification on the quiet crossings on the University of
Colorado A line, if they were quiet or silent.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 22, 2018 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of May 22, 2018)

certification documents which would move the crossing for final approval on the PUC
docket. He explained that, once the PUC issued final approval, it was anticipated that
approval would then come from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) for the grade
crossing attendant removal plan.

General Manager Genova explained that quiet zone was FRA terminology.

General Manager Genova explained that there may be slight variation in the train horns, but
that there were minimum decibel requirements prescribed by the Federal Railroad
Administration.
Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if RTD would explore a conversation with the community that
Mr. Martin referred to as the most troubled by the horns to discuss the type of the horn
sounds being used.
General Manager Genova explained that the sounds were regulated and required approval
by the FRA.
Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that there were all different sounds to these horns and maybe
it would be helpful to explore other sound options.
Director Lubow requested that General Manager Genova and staff keep the public informed
and suggested holding more public meeting or telephone town halls and issuing alerts to
the public.
Chair Tisdale stated that communication was one of RTD’s highest priorities.
Director Anderson asked for clarification on how long the final testing for the G Line would
be and if it was for 21 days or a week.
General Manager Genova explained that the contract stated 21 days of a maintaining a
certain level of service reliability and that the FRA wanted a weeks’ worth of reliable data
to work through their decision-making process

Director Menten stated that recently the Board were presented proposed recommendations
from the PPWG and summarized the recommendation that there were three categories. She
explained that the first was the required triennial review of our affairs, the second was the
current long-standing pass programs, and the third was modification to the nonprofit fare
program. Director Menten thanked all the members of the PPWG for their time and hard
work. She stated that she was uncomfortable with some of the presented options and
being able to describe the financial impacts to her constituents. Director Menten asked staff
to come back to the Board on June 5th and provide a more in depth review in order to
better understand the options and be prepared to inform the public of the PPWG
recommendations.

Director Williams reminded the Board that the PPWG spent thousands of hours reviewing
various programs with strict criteria, which included financial considerations. She added
that the PPWG had worked very hard to make sure that they stayed within those
constraints. Director Williams reminded the Board that the PPWG information was available
on the RTD website under the Pass Program Working Group heading that would answer
some of the questions and concerns.
Director Broom stated that he had recently read some synopsis of the tax bill that was
passed by Congress last year and that part of the bill alluded to employers or profit
companies would no longer be able to write off costs associated with providing employees
with bus passes. He requested more information on the bill and for staff to speculate its
impact to RTD pass sales.
Director Anderson stated that she was concerned that some people would subsidize other
people and that many of those people might just be over the financial cut off for a
discounted pass. She added that did not seem equitable. Director Anderson said she would
like to keep fares for everyone as low as possible and that, if there was a social welfare
component to fares, that should be provided by social welfare agencies. She added that the
decisions on the PPWG recommendation were not simple and she was not ready to discuss
the outcomes with the community and needed more information.
Chair Tisdale stated that all the Board members would benefit from more information.
Director Deadwyler agreed with Directors Anderson and Menten that she would like to have
staff come back and explain the recommendations because they were not simple.
Director Solano stated that the PPWG needed to finish the process. He said that the Board
needed to allow staff to examine the different recommendations and make adjustments.
Chair Tisdale clarified the request from the Board that staff explain all of the different
factors that impacted the three recommendations submitted by staff for presentation during
the public outreach meetings and provide enough information to understand how each
model impacted RTD and the public. He explained that there were essentially three silos,
that were to be presented to the public for comment, A: being no action at all, B: being
the planned fare increase that staff had analyzed and budgeted with some tweaks in some
of the elements of our pass programs, and C: implement all of the recommendations that
were submitted by the Pass Program Working Group. Chair Tisdale stated that some of the
Directors wanted to be able to discuss and explain all of the recommendations to the public
and not just present three options.

Director Menten stated that she was not comfortable being able to present the PPWG
recommendations to the public as it was currently and that she believed the wording from
the RTD mission was to offer "affordable" transportation. She added that people who did
not use the system still needed to be considered as part of the system. Director Menten
stated she needed to know the financial impact of the program.
Chair Tisdale asked General Manager Genova to comment to ensure staff understood what
the Directors were asking to be clarified. He summarized the comments and stated that
what was presented previously were plans A, B, and C, to go to the public. He added that
the Directors requested a breakdown of all the various elements in each plan to add clarity
and definition to the elements of the Pass Program Working Group's recommendations.
General Manager Genova stated he would need to consult the team, but staff would
provide additional information and clarity around all of the different items and also seek
additional input from the Board. He stated that staff had been working on the schedule and
planning dates and venues for public outreach and there would be eight public meetings
and additional tools for public outreach. General Manager Genova added that it was
important to continue with getting those dates and venues planned and the first outreach
was planned for mid-June.
Director Lubow said she was confused about what the staff would be presenting.
Director Walker stated that what staff proposed was not finite or resolute and that there
was flexibility in everything presented to the public, which was why staff conducted public
outreach, to get input. He added that there had to be something for the public to discuss,
an image or a talking point, to get the conversation started. Director Walker explained that
bus routes and bus stops fluctuate from or change from when they were originally
presented and when those proposed changes were presented to the public. He added that
he supported what staff had presented to take to the public, but was always interested in
hearing more from staff. Director Walker reminded the Board that nothing was set because
we change our system every three months.
Chair Tisdale thanked Director Walker and agreed that nothing was set, even though it
looks set, because things were always subject to further change and comment.
Director Williams requested that the Board know in advance where and when the public
outreach meeting would occur.

Director Broom asked for clarification from the Board members on requesting more
information and if the Directors were planning on creating a different option than what the
PPWG had recommended. He added that it was unclear how the Board would accomplish
that work.
Director Menten stated that she wanted to break down the three jelled-together
recommendations separately in order to understand, when meeting with the public, how all
the different recommendations were decided.
Director Deadwyler stated that she had a lot of comments and concerns but did not think
the current meeting was the forum for that discussion. She suggested that a conversation
with staff one-on-one to discuss the concerns.
Chair Tisdale agreed with Director Deadwyler and suggested that staff take time to visit
with some of the directors.
Director Solano clarified to the Board that RTD was a non-profit agency.

Board Meeting Date: June 26, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors:
1.

Authorize the General Manager or his Designee to consent to release the 16th Street Mall
Alternatives Analysis and Environmental Assessment for the minimum 30-day public review and
comment period; and

2.

Authorize the General Manager or his Designee to negotiate and execute one or more agreements
with the City and County of Denver (CCD) concerning funding, design, construction and
maintenance of the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project within the “Agreement Parameters”
listed in the Discussion section of this report.

This recommendation addresses two of the General Manager’s 2018 goals: Strategic Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability and Strategic Goal #3 – State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
In the late 1970’s and early 1980’s RTD headed the project to build the 16th Street Mall (the Mall) from
Market Street to Broadway, in downtown Denver. The Mall opened in 1982 with the commencement of
RTD’s operation of the Free MallRide service. The Mall was designed as a transit and pedestrian mall
with a three colored diamond-patterned granite paver surface arranged in a pattern that resembles a
rattlesnake or a Navajo rug, along with carefully detailed placement of trees, water fountains, specialty
light fixtures and urban design furnishings. The design by I.M. Pei & Partners and Hanna/Olin greatly
contributes to the Mall’s designation as a culturally significant resource.
The Free MallRide service has subsequently been extended west to Denver Union Station (DUS). It
provides a critical means of moving people in downtown Denver, and the service is particularly important
for RTD. It provides first and last mile connections for transit patrons and facilitates transfers between
RTD services throughout downtown, including between Civic Center, DUS, and light rail along Stout and
California streets. 16th Street is a public street owned by CCD and is designated as a Fixed Guideway by
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) manages the
activities on the mall, and provides maintenance and upkeep of the sidewalk areas, under an
arrangement with CCD.
Following initial construction, due to issues surrounding the construction technique used, a lawsuit was
filed that resulted in a settlement agreement with the designers and constructors who paid RTD
approximately $4 million in damages over a 25-year period, which payments are now expired. Since
construction, the Mall has required continual maintenance at an ever-increasing cost. As a result, in
recent years, RTD has considered potential replacement of the Free MallRide transitway surface
(Transitway). Similarly, over the past few years, the City and County of Denver (CCD) has been

Packet Pg. 120

11.A

considering place-making and livability aspects of the Mall. Measures to make the Mall a gathering place
for the community remain a priority for CCD. This, and economic vitality, are top issues both for CCD
and for the DDP.
In November 2016, consideration of a broader vision for the Mall, which would include evaluation of the
Transitway surface materials, as well as the alignment of the transit lanes within the Mall footprint, was
contemplated. This led to CCD, RTD, and DDP entering into a partnership in early 2017 to initiate an
Alternatives Analysis (AA) and an Environmental Assessment (EA), consistent with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to determine an alternative that would address the needs of RTD,
CCD, and DDP. The NEPA analysis is required as a result of the award of federal grant funds to RTD for
reconstruction of the Mall. During this and previous required analyses under the auspices of NEPA, RTD
and our partners have considered alternative materials for reconstruction, including concrete. However,
during input required under NEPA, various parties, including groups concerned with design and historic
preservation, have necessitated the decision to rebuild the Mall with granite, generally consistent with
historic design.
A Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) was selected in January 2018 and presented to the RTD Board on
January 23, 2018 (the Project). The Project will remove the median sections to realign the Transitway
within the 80-foot width of the Mall. Two-way transit service will be maintained as will the culturallysignificant I.M. Pei, Hanna/Olin design (granite pavers in a diamond-shaped pattern). The Project also
includes replacing trees using species that honor the intent of the original design. The EA document will
be ready to release for public review in the near future. This request for consent to release the EA for
public review and comment is being submitted to the RTD Board of Directors for action consistent with
previous environmental studies undertaken by RTD. A Briefing Document that summarizes the EA is
attached.
DISCUSSION
Capital Costs
Concurrent with preparation of the AA and EA, RTD and CCD have been working toward a framework to
define capital and maintenance responsibilities and costs. Regarding capital costs, RTD is committing the
federal funds from two FTA grants previously awarded to RTD for rehabilitation of the Transitway
(provided that FTA approves changes to the scope of those grants), as well as RTD’s 1/3 share of the
Local Match to the grants in an amount not to exceed $1,064,834. These grants include:
•

Bus Livability Grant:
Total Award: $9,973,748
FTA Funding: $7,978,998
Local Match: $1,994,750
RTD 1/3 Portion of Local Match:

•

$664,917

STP-Metro Grant:
Total Award: $5,998,750
FTA Funding: $4,799,000
Local Match: $1,199,750
RTD 1/3 Portion of Local Match:

$399,917

CCD is taking responsibility for the remainder of capital construction costs above the funds committed
by RTD described above. CCD intends to negotiate and pay for a five year warranty period from the
contractor building the Project.

11.A

Maintenance Costs
Because of the frequency and cost of Transitway maintenance, which has grown to roughly $1 million
annually, alternatives to the current Mall materials and design have been considered by RTD as described
in the Background. Currently, RTD and CCD have an IGA in place which obligates RTD to perform
maintenance of the Transitway. CCD reimburses RTD 30% of the cost of paver maintenance, up to
$300,000 per year. Therefore, in the current arrangement, RTD is responsible for the balance of the
costs over CCD’s contribution.
RTD and CCD have been discussing the parameters of a new maintenance agreement predicated on the
reconstruction of the Mall and mindful of the RTD Board’s direction to significantly lower and cap RTD’s
maintenance cost exposure. CCD staff have indicated their willingness to ask City Council to consider an
arrangement where, following the warranty period, RTD would pay 30% of annual maintenance costs,
up to $100,000 per year. Under this agreement, CCD would be responsible for 70% of maintenance
costs and all additional maintenance costs when the RTD cap is met. RTD’s 30% responsibility is
deemed reasonable by RTD staff in that the typical street cross-section is 80 feet, while the Transitway
cross-section is 24 feet (two twelve-foot lanes), which is 30% of the total right-of-way. Additionally,
during the warranty period (as well as for the last year of construction, when RTD’s maintenance cost
responsibility under the existing agreement should be close to zero), RTD will contribute $100,000 per
year and CCD will contribute $200,000 per year into a maintenance reserve account.
RTD staff has prepared an estimate of maintenance costs under the proposed agreement compared with
those under the current arrangement. This comparison is provided solely for illustrative purposes - exact
commitments and expenditures will vary.
Under the existing terms: with RTD having no cap on maintenance expenditures; assuming $1
million in total annual maintenance costs consistent with current experience; and assuming CCD
continues to contribute $300,000 capped annually; then between 2019 and 2037 RTD would
expend $13.3 million (or more) total in current year (uninflated) dollars for Mall maintenance.
Assuming 3% per year cost escalation over this period, RTD’s expenditures in inflated dollars
would exceed $18 million.
Under the proposed terms: with RTD continuing to maintain the Mall during construction (in
decreasing dollar amounts); with 6 years of RTD maintenance reserve contributions at $100,000
year commencing during the last year of construction (2022) through the proposed warranty
period; and then assuming RTD’s maximum exposure and expenditures from 2028 through 2037
at the capped amount of $100,000; then between 2019 and 2037, RTD would expend $3 million
(or less) total in current year (uninflated) dollars for Mall Maintenance.
These proposed terms with a savings to RTD of at least more than $10 million in current year dollars
and at approximately $15 million in inflated dollars between 2019 and 2037, with a cap on RTD
maintenance costs and budget certainty, provide staff with confidence in presenting this proposal to the
Board.
Agreement Parameters
Therefore, understanding the position of RTD as described in this Board Report, the Board authorizes the
General Manager to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with CCD concerning funding,
design, construction and maintenance of the Project within the following parameters:


CCD will arrange for the design, construction and maintenance of the Project consistent with
the EA approved by the FTA, in compliance with all applicable federal, State, City, and RTD
requirements, by no later than the conclusion of 2022. The parties will cooperate and where
necessary, give RTD approval rights, to ensure the safe and compliant provision of transit
services.

Packet Pg. 122

11.A



RTD will maintain continuing control of the Transitway in a manner satisfactory to RTD for its
useful life and have exclusive use to operate its transit vehicles in a manner substantially
similar to the transit services provided currently.



RTD will make available federal grant funds allowed by the FTA to CCD as a subrecipient,
pursuant to the Bus Livability grant and the DRCOG STP-Metro grant. RTD’s financial
contribution to the capital costs of the Project is limited to 1/3 of the local match for those
two grants not to exceed $1,064,834.



CCD will be responsible for all maintenance costs of the Project; provided that, RTD will pay
30% of incurred maintenance costs up to $100,000; and $100,000 per year during the
warranty period into a maintenance reserve account.

In conclusion, of utmost consideration is that there is need to keep transit service on the Mall; address
escalating maintenance frequency and costs; and limit RTD’s future exposure to maintenance costs. The
LPA that was selected earlier this year supports continued Free MallRide operations under the same
conditions as the shuttle currently operates. It provides for continued two-way transit, with the
Transitway re-aligned to remove the wide center median in favor of additional sidewalk space on either
side. Further, the direction regarding RTD capital and maintenance costs laid out in this report assures
that these goals are met while significantly lowering, limiting and capping RTD’s upfront and ongoing
financial requirements as well as provides assurances that the Mall will be maintained to required
standards for RTD’s continued use.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial cost to RTD for the release of the EA. Under the parameters discussed in this
Report, RTD capital contributions to the Project would be in an amount not to exceed $1,064,834. RTD
Maintenance costs would be reduced, as described, to $100,000 per year through the warranty period
then to a 30% share of maintenance costs, capped at $100,000 annually subsequently.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors:
a) Authorize the General Manager or his Designee to consent to release the 16th Street Mall
Alternatives Analysis and Environmental Assessment for the minimum 30-day public review
and comment period; and
b) Authorize the General Manager or his Designee to negotiate and execute one or more
agreements with the City and County of Denver (CCD) concerning funding, design,
construction and maintenance of the Project within the “Agreement Parameters” listed in the
Discussion section of this report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not consent to release the 16th Street Mall Alternatives
Analysis and Environmental Assessment for the minimum 30-day public review and comment period;
and further, do not authorize the General Manager or his Designee to negotiate and execute one or
more agreements with CCD concerning funding, design, construction and maintenance of the Project
within the parameters described in this report.
This action is not recommended because the grant funds available to RTD, which are proposed to be
made available to CCD as a subrecipient, are designated for repairing the Mall, and cannot be used
for any other project, purchase or activity. In this case, RTD may be required to return the grant
funding if it is not utilized. Further, RTD does not have any other source of funding budgeted to
undertake fixing the underlying problems with the granite pavement on the Mall. The AA and EA

Packet Pg. 123

11.A

process determined that the street cannot be paved in concrete. RTD’s repair costs have been
around a million dollars each year; this cost is expected to escalate over time. The current
maintenance IGA with CCD expires on December 31, 2022, and will need to be renegotiated.

Briefing Document
Downtown Denver’s 16th Street Mall (Mall) is Denver’s busiest transit artery and premier public
space, one of the longest pedestrian and transit malls in the world, and designated as a transit
fixed guideway. The Mall was designed in the late 1970s as a transit and pedestrian mall by the
renowned architectural firms of I.M. Pei & Partners and Hanna/Olin. Construction of the Mall
was completed in 1982, with an iconic diamond-patterned granite paver surface inspired by the
design of a Navajo blanket, resembling a diamondback rattlesnake skin. Today, the transit
shuttle bus route along the Mall, known as the Free MallRide, eliminates approximately
870 daily bus trips from Downtown Denver streets, reducing traffic congestion. The Mall
energizes the downtown business environment with a unique pedestrian- and transit-oriented
public space.
In recent years, the Free MallRide service has been expanded farther west along 16th Street to
the renovated and revitalized Denver Union Station, a transit hub that connects Free MallRide
passengers to light rail, commuter rail, and local and regional bus connections. The original
12.5 blocks of the Mall, from Market Street to Broadway, are now over 35 years old and in need
of repair and revitalization due to the construction methods that caused failure and
deterioration of the materials, as well as the passage of time. Safety improvements and
updates, mobility solutions, and efforts to increase public use are also needed. Multiple
recommendations and studies to address the Mall’s infrastructure, safety, mobility,
programming, and use have been put forth over the past decade by the City and County of
Denver (CCD), Regional Transportation District (RTD), Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP), and
Downtown Denver Business Improvement District (BID), but none of them have resulted in a
comprehensive program of improvements.
A group of partners comprising RTD, CCD, DDP, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
(Project Partners) propose to implement improvements to the Mall to address infrastructure,
mobility, safety, and public use needs (Project). The Project will be funded through a
combination of Denver Urban Renewal Authority (DURA) Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds,
which must be spent on construction by mid-2022; FTA grant funding; and General Obligation
(GO) bond funding. The Project limits cover the length of the original 12.5 blocks of the Mall
from Market Street to Broadway, the 80-foot width of the Mall from building face to building
face, and portions of cross streets intersecting the Mall (see Figure ES-1).
Because federal funds are proposed to be used for the Project, it must comply with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires consideration of the effects the
proposed project will have on social, economic, and natural resources. FTA, in coordination
with RTD and the other Project Partners, is preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA) to
document the NEPA process and the evaluation of environmental impacts anticipated for the
Project in accordance with 23 Code of Federal Regulations 771.

Project Purpose and Need
The purpose of the Project is to develop and implement a flexible and sustainable design for the
Mall to address deteriorating infrastructure, provide equitable and sufficient space for
high-quality public gathering opportunities, improve pedestrian and vehicle safety, and
continue reliable two-way transit shuttle bus service on the Mall while honoring the Mall’s use
and iconic design.

The following improvements are needed:
•

Address deteriorating infrastructure to allow reasonable maintenance frequency and
costs to businesses and taxpayers. The Mall’s pavement system does not provide drainage
for water that seeps into the mortar base below the granite pavers. Water becomes
trapped and loosens the granite pavers during freeze-thaw cycles, and the pavers

BRIEFING DOCUMENT

•

Improve safety for pedestrians and vehicles. There is no clear visual or physical delineation
between the pedestrian walkways and the transit way, other than short, 4-inch curbs of the
same material and color as the adjacent surfaces, which were designed purposefully to
blend in with the surrounding pavement pattern. Pedestrians intentionally (as a result of
crowding on the undersized pedestrian walkways, which are too narrow to meet CCD
downtown pedestrian walkway standards and carry peak hour pedestrian volumes) or
accidentally (as a result of lack of clear delineation) walk in and across the transit way,
causing pedestrian-vehicle conflicts and near-misses. In addition, the finish applied to the
pavers has become slippery, causing pedestrian slips and falls and a loss of bus traction
during inclement weather.

•

Improve mobility for desired transit operations and for all users. The Free MallRide
program is a critical link in Denver’s transit system. It currently serves 39,000 riders each
weekday, and it is estimated to serve 70,000 riders per day by 2035. Frequent maintenance
of the failing pavement results in interruptions to transit service. Pedestrian walkways are
undersized for peak hour pedestrian traffic, do not meet CCD standard pedestrian walkway
widths, and are frequently obstructed by pedestrians gathering at bus stops.

•

Increase opportunities for public use of the Mall as an iconic civic space for leisure,
commerce, and tourism. In the median blocks, transit ways separate the public realm into
three separate zones, limiting space for safe and engaging public use and amenities. A
negative perception of safety, along with isolation and lack of natural surveillance of the
medians, inhibits positive public use of the Mall in some locations. Adequate and flexible
public space is needed to attract more people to the Mall for quality public gathering
activities.

Alternatives Considered and Evaluated
The Project Partners developed a range of alternatives comprising physical and operational
design elements to address the Mall’s problems and needs. The alternatives considered input
received from stakeholders and the public during the Project scoping period. Input included the
need for improved safety and security on the Mall, wider pedestrian walkways, a less slippery
surface, consistency with the iconic design, strong multi-modal connections, frequent Free
MallRide bus service, and continued programming and events to activate the Mall.
All alternatives maintain current and planned Free MallRide service levels on the Mall, per
RTD’s service plans and Denver’s Downtown Multimodal Access Plan (CCD et al., 2005).
Although several design elements were studied that would change transit operations, these
design elements were not carried forward into the range of alternatives because they were not
feasible and/or would not address the Project’s purpose and needs. Reducing transit service on
the Mall or maintaining current service levels and shifting future ridership demand to parallel
services (such as bus service on parallel streets or the Free MetroRide) would not meet RTD’s
service requirements, nor would it accommodate all riders.

eventually break over time. Other elements of the Mall (for example, fountains, tree
infrastructure, and electric power supply) are also in need of rehabilitation, modernization,
or both.

•

Three asymmetrical blocks on the western end of the Mall from Market Street to
Arapahoe Street, with the transit ways—separated by a small, 6-foot median with light
standards—offset from the center of the Mall, creating a wider public space on one side
of the Mall than the other.

•

Seven symmetrical median blocks in the middle of the Mall from Arapahoe Street to
Tremont Place, with a median in the center between the transit ways.

•

Two-and-a-half asymmetrical blocks on the eastern end of the Mall from Tremont Place
to Broadway, in the same configuration as described for the western end of the Mall.

Four of the alternatives would rebuild the Mall to replace the failing infrastructure, while one
alternative would partially repair the infrastructure. Table ES-1 summarizes the key features of

BRIEFING DOCUMENT

The screening evaluation concluded that only two alternatives met the Project purpose and
need: the Center Running Alternative and Center Running and New Asymmetrical Alternative.
The latter alternative as it was originally designed did not meet the Project purpose and need as
well the former: on the asymmetrical blocks, there was no amenity zone on one side of the
block to provide a buffer between the pedestrian walkway and the transit way; there were
fewer trees to encourage public use; and the wider side of the blocks provided much more
public space than the narrow side, providing more benefit to property and business owners on
the wider side and perpetuating inequitable distribution of public space for adjacent property
owners. However, the Center Running and New Asymmetrical Alternative would have less
impact on the historic design of the Mall than the Center Running Alternative because it would
maintain the configuration of asymmetrical blocks at the ends of the Mall and symmetrical
blocks in the middle.
The Center Running and New Asymmetrical Alternative was then refined to better meet the
Project purpose and need by further centering the transit way in the asymmetrical blocks to
add more public space and a row of trees on the narrow side of the cross-section design. The
new row of trees would provide an amenity zone to act as a buffer between the pedestrian
walkway and the transit way, improving safety; would align with a row of trees on the center
running blocks, similar to the existing single row of trees aligned for the entire length of the
Mall; and would provide trees to encourage public use and more equitably distribute space on
both sides of the block. The refined Center Running and New Asymmetrical Alternative was
selected as the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) for evaluation in the EA.
Concurrently, the pavement options analysis and input from Section 106 Consultation
concluded that granite pavers in a mortar bed would most minimize harm to the Mall as a
historic resource, and the LPA includes a new pavement system of granite pavers on a new
concrete sub-slab.
The No Build Alternative represents future conditions without the construction and operation
of the Project, including continued repairs on an as-needed basis. The No Build Alternative does
not meet the purpose and need for the Project, as it would not replace failing and outdated
infrastructure, provide safer delineation between pedestrian walkways and the transit way,
address the slippery finish of the pavers, reduce the frequency of maintenance impacts on
transit operations, expand undersized pedestrian walkways, nor improve the spatial
configuration of the Mall to improve public use. However, the No Build Alternative is retained
as a basis for comparison of the environmental impacts of the LPA.

Attachment: 16thStreetMall_Briefing Document_06122018 (3506 : 16th Street Mall Project)

A two-step screening process (referred to as Level 1 and Level 2 screenings) evaluated the
alternatives. Level 1 evaluated the alternatives on criteria related to purpose and need factors,
while Level 2 further screened the alternatives on purpose and need factors and on costs, and
community and environmental impacts. Pavement materials were evaluated using similar
criteria.

Proposed Action (Locally Preferred Alternative)
The LPA, illustrated on Figure ES-3, includes rebuilding the Mall between Market Street and
Broadway to provide the following features:

BRIEFING DOCUMENT

•

Installing a new granite pavement system, new trees, and new underground infrastructure
to replace the Mall’s failing and deteriorating infrastructure to reduce safety concerns and
the negative effects of frequent maintenance and repair activities to the Free Mallride
service, as follows:

− The pattern of the granite pavers would honor and complement the original I.M. Pei–
Hanna/Olin design, but would not replicate the pattern in every detail because changes
to the existing pattern would be required to accommodate current standards and
requirements such as the ADA and RTD’s bus loading and unloading requirements.
− The existing light fixtures, which are replicas of the original design, would be reused.
− New trees, in a variety of species that meet current CCD forestry requirements and that
meet similar criteria to those used in the original I.M. Pei–Hanna/Olin design, would be
planted in a placement that honors the existing character of the Mall by retaining
geometric and spatial relationships of the original design. The trees would be planted in
new suspended tree infrastructure that provides 1,000 cubic feet of soil volume for each
tree. This amount of soil volume is needed to ensure healthy growth and longevity of
the tree canopy.
•

Delineating pedestrian walkways from the transit way with an amenity zone, including
trees, lights, and features (for example, benches, chairs, planters, and kiosks) to improve
safety and reduce pedestrian/transit conflicts. The LPA could be designed with a curb or
without a curb between the pedestrian areas and transit ways; both design options are
evaluated in the EA. Additional delineating features that may be considered include visual
delineations such as in-pavement lighting or different color materials; a strip of textured
surface, detectable to the visually impaired; bollards; or other delineating features that
would not impair movement across the Mall, either alone or in combination. The decision of
whether to design the LPA with curbs or without curbs, along with which additional
delineating features would be included in the design, will made as more detailed design is
available.

•

Installing bulb-outs at cross streets to reduce the crossing distance for pedestrians on those
streets, except for instances where space is reserved for existing bicycle or light rail
infrastructure. Changes to pedestrian crossing controls such as crosswalks and crossing
signals would be decided during subsequent design phases. Additional intersection
improvements to slow traffic and increase pedestrian safety (for example, pavement
patterns, pavement color, pavement texture, or raised pavement) will be considered during
subsequent design phases.

•

Creating wider pedestrian walkways to better accommodate pedestrian volumes and
adhere to the following CCD pedestrian walkway standards, as follows:

Attachment: 16thStreetMall_Briefing Document_06122018 (3506 : 16th Street Mall Project)

− The pavement system would consist of granite pavers with improved surface friction
over a new and improved concrete sub-base, complete with a system to drain moisture
that penetrates the surface.

Maintaining an alignment that retains the historic pattern of asymmetrical blocks at the
ends of the Mall and symmetrical blocks in the middle of the Mall, and that supports the
need for safety, mobility, and increased public use, as follows:
− The asymmetrical blocks would maintain the existing asymmetrical alignment, with the
following modifications: the 6-foot median with light fixtures currently located between
the transit ways would be removed and a 5-foot amenity zone with a new row of trees
would be added on the narrow side of the block to act as a buffer between the
pedestrian walkway and the transit way, and the pattern of the underlying pavement as
it currently exists would be shifted to the side 2 feet to align with the widened
pedestrian walkway width (10 feet) on the narrow side of the block and accommodate
the removal of the 6-foot median.
− The alignment of the median blocks would be configured to provide the transit way in
the center of the block and consolidate public space into two equal areas on either side,
each consisting of a 9-foot amenity zone with trees, 10-foot pedestrian walkway, and
9-foot patio/gathering area, rather than as it is currently configured; the pattern of the
underlying pavement as it currently exists would mimic the Mall’s existing color and
pattern.

Implementation of the LPA will require intergovernmental agreements between CCD and RTD
(currently being drafted), which will govern agreements regarding the following:
•

Grant funding available to RTD (with CCD as a subrecipient) for the Project, subject to
obtaining approval from the FTA, Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), and
RTD Board of Directors.

•

Ongoing maintenance of the transit way.

•

Ongoing use of the pedestrian walkways to ensure the necessary clear width is maintained
for unimpeded pedestrian traffic.

•

Funding for maintenance of the amenity zone, pedestrian walkway, and patio/gathering
area will continue to be provided through an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
CCD and BID.

•

Additionally, the Memorandum of Agreement that addresses mitigation for the adverse
effects to the 16th Street Mall historic property will be executed prior to completion of the
NEPA process. The Consulting Parties will be invited to continue to participate in future
phases to coordinate on subsequent design elements.

Construction of the LPA is anticipated to take 2.5 to 4 years in total. Major construction
activities on each block are anticipated to last approximately 8 months to 12 months; however,
minor construction activities or unforeseen utility-related construction activities may last
longer. Construction will generally occur in two- to six- block segments within the Project limits
(Figure ES-1), and each segment will require multiple construction phases.

Public Involvement and Agency Coordination
The following information outlines efforts used to engage the public, stakeholders, and
agencies and summarizes engagement and outreach efforts for project scoping, the alternatives
analysis process, and coordination through the development of the EA.
Public involvement and stakeholder and agency coordination began with the Project scoping
period in May 2017. The following scoping activities were conducted: agency coordination
meetings; key stakeholder interviews; meetings with small groups representing advocacy
organizations, the hospitality industry, businesses and property owners, and residents; a
stakeholder working group workshop; outreach at a Meet in the Street event on the Mall; and a
public meeting held on July 27, 2017. Input from the scoping period was taken into account in
finalizing the Project purpose and need, developing the range of alternatives, performing
alternatives screening, analyzing environmental impacts, and developing mitigation measures.
Small group meetings, stakeholder working group workshops, and public meetings were held
during both Level 1 and Level 2 alternatives screening evaluation steps. The first group of
meetings provided information on the range of alternatives developed and the results of the
Level 1 screening, and gathered input on those results and considerations for the Level 2
screening; the public meeting was held October 18, 2017. The second group of meetings
provided information on the results of the Level 2 screening and the recommended LPA, and
gathered input for consideration in refinement and analysis of the LPA; the public meeting was
held March 8, 2018. Input from these meetings resulted in the development of new alternatives
and refinements to alternatives.

Plan (CMP). The CMP will include, but is not limited to the following measures:
− Access: Maintain reasonable access to businesses and pedestrians during all
phases of construction of the LPA. Maintain reasonable access for cross traffic and
bicycle lanes, except for limited intermittent closures, as well as reasonable access
for other connecting transit service and transit service maintenance on the Mall.
− Communication: During subsequent design phases, form a Business Impacts
Working Group to discuss impacts and construction phasing. Communicate
regularly with businesses about the construction schedule.
− Additional Signage: Coordinate with DDP to develop signage that directs visitors
to businesses during construction. Some of the businesses may benefit from
additional signage because of reduced visibility due to construction activities.
− Regional Outreach: Conduct public outreach to let the local community and region
know that the area is open for business during construction. As Downtown Denver
is a regional destination, it will be important to communicate construction
schedules and special events to the region and even statewide.
− Special Events/Marketing: Coordinate additional outreach, special events, and
extra marketing with local businesses. These would be particularly important to
ensure that visitors and employees know that Downtown Denver and specific
businesses remain open for business during periods of construction.
− Additional Mitigation: Participate with local business organizations, under the
leadership of DDP, to identify other measures the Project could incorporate to
mitigate business impacts. Coordinate and continue to work closely with these
organizations on specialized outreach, special sales, and extra marketing, in
addition to developing a Project-specific outreach and marketing campaign and
other measures to reduce business impact

Temporary Construction Impacts
•

•

Temporary construction impacts are based on a
range of options for Free MallRide transit service
during construction. RTD prefers options that
would retain Free MallRide service on the Mall
throughout construction. The approaches
described in the EA are not final; construction
phasing would be evaluated as design and
construction planning progresses.
The range of impacts for the Free MallRide
transit service options during construction are as
follows:
− Increase in travel time: negligible to
significant
− Stops removed from the Mall: from two to
three stops to all stops removed
− Ridership loss along Mall and to the RTD
System: 15 to 100 percent
− FTA grant funding loss: $75,000 to $500,000
per year

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 13, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Director, Special Projects

GM

Date:

June 13, 2018

Board Meeting Date: June 19, 2018

Subject:

August 2018 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2018 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized cost savings of approximately $1,924,000 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
The Recommended Action proposed falls in line with the following GM Goals.
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
Changes to RTD transit service, have historically been measured by and related to ridership and financial
impacts. However, current labor market conditions continue to be a serious challenge to the recruitment
and retention of bus and rail operators. More to the point, the amount of service being provided by
operators working on their days off is at a level that impedes employee retention efforts and makes it
difficult to meet our commitments to our customers. To better match the RTD’s scheduled service
offerings to RTD’s available workforce, this proposal starts a process to adjust the level of service on
various routes throughout the District. The proposed service adjustments were conceived in accordance
to the Service Policies and Standards adopted by the RTD Board of Directors.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Notable proposals include a
restructure of service to/from Conifer and Evergreen (CV/CS/CX and EV/ES/EX). Additionally, a proposal
to split the Route 27 into two separate services (Routes 26 and 27) is also included. We will monitor
customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS
Seven public meetings were conducted in Aurora, Boulder, Evergreen, Littleton, Southeast Denver and at
the Blake Administration Building between May 30th and June 11th. Comments and further details from
these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment G of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: proposal rescinded.
Route 85 – Chatfield Avenue: discontinue service on the Route 85 and replace with Flex Route.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

Packet Pg. 171

11.B

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2018 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Service Change Proposals - August 2018

Route 10 – 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local - (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue Saturday service east of Clermont Street, as it is on Sunday/Holidays. Current
ridership along this segment is 168 boardings, corresponding to 10.7 boardings per hour,
which is below both the 10th and 25th percentile standard for CBD Local service of 15.2 22.3 boardings per hour respectively. Alternative service can be found in Routes 6 – East
6th Avenue and 15 East Colfax.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,144 annual hours
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local - (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Due to low ridership it is proposed to reduce Route 20 service frequency from 30 to 60
minutes before 10:00am and after 6:00pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Current
productivity during these time periods is 11.7 passengers per hour, which falls below the
service standard for a CBD Local service of 15.2 boardings per hour.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,100 annual hours
Route 24 – University Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
This proposal discontinues underperforming trips weekday northbound 5:03am (7
boardings), 9:34pm (17 boardings) and southbound 4:43am (10 boardings), 9:13pm (8
boardings). Saturday northbound: 5:39a (9 boardings), 6:39a (12 boardings), 7:34pm (12
boardings) and southbound: 6:13am (12 boardings), 8:13p (9 boardings).
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,665 annual hours
Route 26/27 - Yale Avenue
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Ridership on Route 27 between Englewood Station and Colorado Boulevard has been low
historically and current ridership data shows the segment operating at 12.8 passengers per
hour, which is below the 25 percentile standard for an Urban Local service of 19.1
boardings per hour and only slightly above the 10% standard of 12.2 boardings per hour.
This proposal splits the Route 27 in to two separate route services. The new Route 26 West Yale Avenue service would operate between Southwest Plaza and Englewood
Station. The new Route 27 – East Yale service would operate between University Hills and
Ulster - Tufts.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 4,335 annual hours

Route 3L - East Alameda
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
This proposal consolidates the 5:04pm and 5:24pm trips leaving Civic Center Station.
Ridership on these trips average 39 and 34 boardings respectively, which can be
accommodated on the consolidated trip proposed to depart Civic Center Station at
5:14pm. It is expected that some customers will migrate to earlier and later trips around
the 5:00pm and 5:30pm work stop times.

Atch A – August 2018 Service Changes

Route 73 – Quebec Street
Service Standard type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Reduce Sunday service frequency from 30 to 60 minutes, before 9:00am and after
8:00pm. Productivity during these time periods is 13 boardings per hour.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 893 annual hours
Route 85 – Chatfield Avenue
Service Standard type - Suburban Local - (10%-4.7 pass. per hr. / 25%-11.4 pass. per hr.)
Introduced in August 2015, the Route 85 was implemented as a measure to clarify bus
service access to the Littleton-Mineral Station, as it covered a portion of what was
formerly included in the Route 401-Ranches service. Due to low ridership performance
(9.8 boardings per hour) this proposal discontinues service on the Route 85. However, this
proposal also seeks to replace the service currently offered by the Route 85 with a Flex
route service, operated by the current Call-n-Ride provider. The new service would emulate
the service pattern currently offered by the Route 85, providing the same number of trips
using a Call-n-Ride vehicle.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 4,845 annual hours fixed route service
offset by an increase in paratransit hours.
Routes 100L – South Kipling Limited
CV/CS/CX – Conifer/Denver
EV/ES/EX – Evergreen/Denver
Service Standard type- Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour/ 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
To better match service to customer demand it is proposed to restructure Routes
CV/CS/CX and EV/ES/EX and reduce service between Federal Center Station and
Conifer/Evergreen. Service would be maintained between Civic Center and
Conifer/Evergreen. Trips between Federal Center Station and Civic Center would be
replaced by trips on Route 100L. This proposal is outlined below:

Attachment: Atch A - August 2018 (3495 : August 2018 Service Change)

Route 46 – South Dahlia
Service Standard type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Reduce midday frequency from 30 to 60 minutes south of Colorado Station. Current
productivity for the segment sits at 10.6 boardings per hour. Additionally, reduce Sunday
service frequency from 30 to 60 minutes, where current productivity is 13.8 boardings per
hour.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,530 annual hours

Reduce the number of trips between Conifer and the Federal Center to two trips;
one in the morning peak and one in the evening peak period. Route CS currently
carries 17 passengers solely between Conifer and Federal Center on 8 eastbound
trips and 6 westbound trips. This translates to 3.3 boardings per hour and an
average just under 3 passengers per trip. 8 reverse commuters on the CV/CS/CX
would be impacted.
Discontinue Route CX. All trips would instead stop at Twin Forks PnR,
providing 5 trips on Route CV in each direction, each peak.

Atch A – August 2018 Service Changes

Reduce the number of trips between Evergreen and the Federal Center to two trips;
one in the morning peak and one in the evening peak period. Impacts 10
passengers between Evergreen and Federal Center Station. Route ES currently
carries 10 passengers solely between Evergreen and Federal Center on 5 eastbound
and 5 westbound trips. This translates to 3.5 boardings per hour, averaging 2
passengers per trip.

Remaining service would provide 2 trips on Route EX each direction, each peak and
would provide 3 trips on Route EV each direction, each peak.
Discontinue service between Evergreen PnR and Aspen Park PnR. Impacts 1
passenger. Lutheran Church PnR passengers would instead need to board at
Evergreen PnR.
Discontinue reverse peak in-service on all routes. Impacts 2 passengers.
Provide 5 additional Route 100L trips between Federal Center Station and Civic
Center Station to replace discontinued Route CS and ES trips. Alternative service
can also be found the W Line light rail service and the formation of Van Pools.
Reverse peak service on the 100L would be provided on a 7:00am westbound and
a 4:30pm eastbound 100L trip.
This proposal would save approximately 20 weekday hours and an estimated 2 weekday
FTE’s. Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 5,100 annual hours

Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Service type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue 6:11am and 8:11am northbound trips. Average daily ridership on these trips is
14.9 and 10.7 respectively.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 408 annual hours
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Service type - Urban Local -(10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Due to low ridership it is proposed to discontinue 4:34am northbound trip from Aurora
Metro Center on weekends, which have 3 boardings on Saturdays and 5 boardings on
Sundays. Alternate trips are available approximately 30 minutes earlier and later from the
same location.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 55 annual hours

Discontinue 3:13am northbound trip due to low ridership. The latest data shows an
average of 4 passenger boardings are affected by this proposal.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 383 annual hours
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/19th
Service type - Urban Local -(10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
It is proposed to discontinue the route portion south of Downtown Boulder Station,
between Downtown Boulder Station and Table Mesa, due to low ridership, on Saturdays
and Sundays/Holidays. Alternate routes are available along the Broadway corridor and
within the ¼ mile walking distance of current routing along Moorhead drive. Ridership on
Saturdays and Sundays, currently is less than 1 passenger per trip on the Moorhead
section. The other portion of Route 204 south of Downtown Boulder Station is duplicative
to Routes DASH, SKIP and/or 225.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,540 annual hours
Route 209 – CU/Mohawk/Talbot
STAMPEDE – CU/East Campus
Service type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
It is proposed to reduce the AM and PM peak frequency to 30 minutes versus the current
15 minute frequency, as well as the current midday 30 minute frequency to 60 minute
frequency, due to low ridership. Maximum passenger loads per trip range from 1 – 18
passengers. The majority of the route’s boardings and alightings occur between Colorado
& 30th Street and Euclid & 18th Street (Eastbound 165/185 boardings, Westbound
193/210 alightings). This section of the route is duplicative to Route STAMPEDE, which
operates at 10 minute frequency or better, all day.
In cooperation with CU Boulder and City of Boulder, it is proposed to discontinue Route
STAMPEDE between Colorado/Discovery Drive and Marine Street and 30th Street. CU
Boulder will provide connections between these two locations via its Buff Route. Route
frequency for Route STAMPEDE would be every 10 minutes, 7am – 5:30pm and every 15
minutes 5:30pm – 7pm. Service span will be expanded to 8:30pm to provide connections
between CU Main Campus and East Campus, for evening classes Additional frequency of
5 minutes would be maintained for major class start and end times, at 9:00am, 10:00am,
noon, 2:00pm and 3:00pm.
Anticipated resource impacts include an increase in 2,295 annual hours due to
adjustments related to the new CBA.

Attachment: Atch A - August 2018 (3495 : August 2018 Service Change)

This route was implemented in April of 2016 to provide a replacement for service formerly
provided by the Route 10 along Centretech Parkway to the Community College of Aurora
and Buckley Air Force Base. Current ridership performance is relatively low on this service
(17.7 passengers per hour) and so it is proposed to reduce frequency from 30 to 60
minutes.

Free Mall Ride – 16th Street Mall
In effort to better match service levels to ridership demands on the Free Mall Ride, this
proposal adjusts the service frequency of the Mall Shuttle from every 90 seconds to every
180 seconds between the hours of 11:00am and 1:00pm on weekdays. The higher peak
frequency currently scheduled during the lunch peak, could be provided on an “as needed”
basis for special events. This will result in a significant reduction in required hours and
operators for weekday operation, with minimal impacts on ridership.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 10 FTE’s and 11,985 annual hours

Light Rail
D Line – Mineral/18th& California
Responding to changes in the collective bargaining agreement, an adjustment is proposed
to the operations schedule of the D Line, resulting in the use of one more all day train. The
additional cars necessary to form the 3 car consist will come from a change of consist
length (or the number of light rail vehicles/cars assigned to a train) on both the L and R
Lines. Both the L and R Lines ridership profiles are such that peak ridership capacity does
not exceed the capacity provided on one light rail one car.

Re: Proposed discontinuance of Route 85
Dear Members of the RTD Board:
I am writing on behalf of the Ken-Caryl Ranch Master Association Board of Directors
concerning the proposed discontinuance of Route 85. We believe that this route provides
an important service to the residents and businesses located on Ken-Caryl Ranch and the
surrounding area. While ridership is not high it is very important to the citizens that do use it
and it would be a shame to eliminate this route.
If you have questions, please feel free to contact me at 303.979.1876 x116 or email
chrisp@kcranch.org. Thank you in advance for considering our request and service to

the resid' " Wnesses of Ken-Caryl Ranch.

Staff in attendance included Cesar Ochoa, David Menter, Jessie Carter. There were 7 members of the
public including Nicholas Sands, Rideshare & Carshare Colorado (DRCOG Vanpool) . Board member
Natalie Menton, District M was in attendance.
Cesar Ochoa, Service Planner/Scheduler, West Team Lead started the hearing and briefly outlined the
proposed August 2018 schedule changes and reminded all that changes at this time were proposed and
that citizens could comment via speaking, writing their comments down, email, or mail. He said public
comments received would be considered by RTD staff and that final changes would ultimately be taken
to the board for its final approval. He said that he would take comments of the proposed CV and EV
route changes first and said DRCOG vanpool staff were on hand to answer any questions about
replacement vanpools if needed. He added that in general the proposed route reductions were a
response to low ridership and to help address an on going operator shortage.
Sandy Bowen expressed concerned that the ES pattern was proposed for elimination. asked that the
existing 2:15p Wb ES trip (between CCS and the Federal Center) be covered by adding another 100L trip
at that time. also asked that the 2:15p Wb trip continue as an ES at least as far as the Paradise Hills
PnR.
Mary Beth Patterson was concerned that the CS pattern was proposed for elimination. said that the
last Eb AM CS trip served students from Pine Jct and Aspen Park who commute to Red Rocks Community
College near the Federal Center. added that others on the last AM Eb ES also use it from Evergreen to
reach Red Rocks Community College.
Sylvia Segler spoke about recent stop changes made to routes 28 and 32. said is elderly and has
trouble walking. (1) Said these routes should continue to make a stop directly at the 16th Street Mall
instead of one block away. (2) also said that existing route 32 buses, which currently layover at their
east terminal next to the Zoo on 23rd Ave, park too far away from Colorado Blvd, making transfers
to/from route 40 a long walk with no sidewalks along 23rd Ave. Because of the long distance of the
layover point from Colorado Blvd, said route 32 Wb buses should have to loop around back to Colorado
Blvd also at the beginning of their westbound trips. (3) also said that recent schedule reductions on the
28 and 32 should now require that schedules of the 32 and 28 be staggered, so that buses are not
operating down their respective streets at exactly the same time. (4) also said that due to recent
reduction of Saturday service on the 28, route 32 should operate more frequently.
Helen Katich expressed concern about a recent minor change made to Sb route 12. explained was the
Program Manager at ‘Metro Caring Denver’ (1100 E. 18th Ave, at Downing) and that her social service
agency serves low income clients, including 60,000 client grocery purchases made there each year. Her
concern is that route 12 sb, no longer turns west on 18th to get to Sb Ogden, but rather now it turns on
19th. The end result has been that Sb route 12 clients now must carry handfuls of full grocery bags
another 1 and ½ blocks to reach the Sb route 12 bus stop. asked that the recent route 12 change be
reconsidered.

David Smith asked about proposed 100L changes, and if the existing longer trips to Ken Caryl ranch
would be retained. (Mr. Ochoa responded that they would be retained). Mr. Smith also asked about
the ES and if all service south of Evergreen PnR would be eliminated. (Mr. Ochoa responded
affirmatively). Mr. Smith also asked if the G Line were to open this summer, if there would also be more
public comments solicited about all the associated bus changes. (Mr. Ochoa responded that all the
public comments about bus route changes associated with the G Line were handled in 2016, when the
bus and G Line service plans were finalized and went to the board at that time. He said that numerous
public meetings were held at that time and said that bus changes are already built in RTD scheduling
software).

There were 6 members from the public in attendance, along with Director Natalie Menten with the RTD
Board. RTD Staff in attendance included David Menter and Jessie Carter.
Glenda Bartels stated that she understood the proposal to split the Route 27 into two separate routes,
but asked what are the alternatives for people who live along the segment between Englewood Station
and Colorado Boulevard (Harvard Gulch) and why the elimination is needed? She also expressed her
concern over the proposal for the weekend Route 10 service reduction, stating that there had been a
recent reduction in service to the Route 10. Additionally, she requested that the Route 10 connections
between returned to the previous schedule timing at 12th –Pennsylvania in an effort to maintain
connections with the Route 15.
Chris Humphries stated that the morning service on Route 27 arrives late to Englewood Station causing
her to have to tale the E Line to DUS rather than her intended D Line trip to connect to the Route 15.
Her destination is Colfax and Willow. She also commented that an alternative cancellation could be
considered on the Route 87 Ltd, due to low ridership. She also mentioned that Porter Hospital access
would be harmed by the Route 27 proposal. Ms. Humphries also requested that we look into the width
of the stalls in the public restrooms at Civic Center Station and question why there were no automatic
doors at the gates at Denver Union Station.
Karlyn Huffman was thankful for the message conveyed to Route 27 operators allow her to be dropped
off closer to her residence. She requested that service be extended from the Route 46 to the Yale
Station area. She also reported that her arm was closed in the door of a light rail train southbound, at
Colorado Center Station. She reported that a week ago Tuesday, she witnessed a large group of people
left waiting at Southmoor Station due to dropped runs.
Samuel Herbert expressed his opposition to the cancellation of reverse peak service between the CBD
and the Federal Center. He and another passenger who is also disabled, use the service to get to work at
the Federal Center. He currently uses trips at 7:10am from 12th Broaway to the Federal Center, returning
home using a 4:30pm trip from the Federal Center to Capitol Hill. He stated the same trip using the W
Line would increase his commute time to 3 hours, due to connections and wait time.

Natalie Menton, District M was in attendance.
Staff in attendance included Cesar Ochoa and David Menter. There were 18 members of the public.
One written comment was received. Board members included Natalie Menten and Peggy Catlin. Mr.
Ochoa started the hearing by explaining the purpose of the meeting and reasons behind the proposed
service cuts. After most public comments were received, Directors Menten and Catlin provided
additional detail about the operator shortage, the budget, the labor contract, and the need to curtail
low used services.
Dan Hawbaker expressed his concern that route 85 should remain. He said there is so little RTD service
in the Ken Caryl area to begin with it makes no sense to cut service further. He was frustrated that this
was the second time the route had been proposed for elimination said taxpayers in the area deserve
more than the current low level of RTD service. The CnR is not reliable and it does not have room for
you. The CnR vehicle also wanders slowly to everyone’s house before it finally arrives at Mineral
Station, so that you can’t get to work on time.
Kimberly Wendt said that she uses route 85 regularly to reach the Mineral LRT Station, so that she can
ride Light Rail, for work at the Auraria Campus. She said route 85 ridership likely has been suppressed
due to service reliability problems, which should be addressed. The potential alternative service, S.
Jeffco CnR, she has tried in the past but she has been denied rides on it due to capacity problems and
that it is far too slow.
Nicole Pelham said she uses route 85 since there is no parking available at the Mineral LRT Station. She
transfers to the C or D line to get to the Auraria Campus. She said the CnR bus is too slow and that she
has been denied rides at times during rush hours. The CnR service is far less useful since it deviates so
often and is so slow for rush hour riders. For CnR to work, she said additional CnR buses would need to
be added, and they would need to be dedicated to operate directly to/from the Mineral LRT Station to
be of any use. (Mr. Ochoa said RTD was looking into CnR capacity needs).
Amie Fishman expressed concern about eliminating CS route buses between the Federal Center and
Downtown. She was concerned that 100L replacement buses at the Federal Center will not operate in
reverse commute direction to/from Downtown and that existing 100L buses at the Federal Center are
not as reliable as the CS. She said she does not believe that something else cannot be done to solve the
RTD operator shortage problem, so that route 85 can be kept.
Pete Gray expressed concern about route 85 and said he used it to connect to/from Light Rail at Mineral
Station, to commute down to work in an office park served by route 85. He said he was able to get his
current job by demonstrating to his boss, when he was hired, that I could get to/from work by using RTD
route 85.

Twila Colville said she uses the 85 to commute, via LRT at Mineral Station, to work Downtown. She took
a new job Downtown because route 85 allowed her to do it. She said she had used the CnR on occasion
but that it often was too full to accommodate her. She also said the CnR was far too slow.
Anthony Lott said he lived in Ken Caryl Ranch and that route 85, operating through the community
directly on Continental Divide road, provides a needed service. He said the Ken Caryl HOA board
strongly supported route 85 and recognized it as a valuable community resource. He said the CnR
meanders too much and it is not able to provide as direct and fast service to the Mineral LRT station. He
said route 85 needed better marketing.
Brian Peel expressed concern over route 85 since the Mineral LRT station parking lot fills up so quickly,
especially during the school year. Route 85 is needed to allow area residents’ basic access to light rail,
since they are otherwise closed out due to limited Station parking at Mineral. His employer provides
subsidized RTD passes. He said more marketing was needed for route 85. Another commenter added
that her company also subsidizes her RTD pass.
Charlie O’Melven expressed concern over the proposed cuts in route CS. He uses the CS between the
Twin Forks PnR and the Federal Center (5:27a Eb trip) which he said has had 10 people deboard at the
Federal Center. He said US 285 can be treacherous and the CS provides a valuable service. He said
other alternatives should be considered, instead of eliminating service from the Mountains to the
Federal Center.
Constance Roberts expressed concern that there is so little existing RTD service in the (Ken
Caryl/Littleton) areas that it was especially burdensome to have cuts in route 85, which itself is very
limited service. She said other RTD routes with very frequent service, such as route 15/15L should
instead be looked at for cost savings. She said with the proposed cuts on route 85, the area ended up
with next to no service at all. She said that the S. Jeffco CnR was not reliable, its routing software was
not working well for CnR drivers, and it was causing needless out of direction travel. She said her CnR
driver yesterday had not showed. She commented that several new operators of the CnR did not know
area streets very well and needed better training.
Commenter expressed concern about saving route 85, and said instead that RTD should cut the existing
CnR vehicle it uses to operate to/from Lockheed Martin. They said Lockheed, and not RTD, should be
operating its own private shuttle for its employees.

David Berry (EV, EX, EX) Likes to use all of the EV services to go to the Federal Center and Civic Center
Station. He wants to keep the stop at the Federal Center because he uses it to transfer to the W Line
which takes him to Union Station, there he jumps on the A Line to the airport. He also rides the EV

services to Civic Center Station where he transfers to the Free Mall Shuttle to Union Station, to get to his
office. He said if we get rid of the Federal Center stop, he would have to take all his luggage to Civic
Center and then get on the Free Mall Ride to Union Station and transfer to the A Line, which is not
reasonable when considering the hassle of luggage. Once or twice a week he goes to his lab at the
Federal Center. He would like to keep the Evergreen loop so he doesn’t have to drive to Evergreen Park
n Ride in bad winter weather.
Ed Furlong (CS) Wanted to clarify the proposed changes as presented. He wanted to know if the
proposal had to be accepted or declined in its entirety or could it be amended?
Lee Jacobs (CS) thinks it’s ridiculous to force passengers to ride the bus all the way downtown just to get
on another bus or light rail to get back to the Federal Center. He said it would add more than an hour to
his commute. Also thought we could consider a stop on 6th Ave and Simms.
Mary Baker (EV, EX) wanted to go on record to keep the Federal Center stop and keep the expanded
service window. does not want to lose the 2:15pm trip that leaves Civic Center.
Dean Miller (ES, EX) Long time rider and is concerned that the proposed service reductions would cut off
the mountain community from easy access to light rail (W Line). He is also concerned that Red Rocks
rider coming from the mountains would lose their access to their school using public transportation. He
would also like to keep the Evergreen loop to he doesn’t have to travel to get to a stop in winter
conditions.
Lynn Stekelee (ES, EX) would like to keep the 2:15pm trip on the ES. New, proposed schedule, will force
them to wait an extra hour to catch the bus home.
Betsy Hays (Evergreen Chamber of Commerce President) Thinks her community should keep the level of
public transportation service. also suggested that RTD may be able to promote the transit service
better and work on educating the public about the service we provide. Mentioned that many people
are not aware of what RTD offers up in the mountains.
Jay Huggins (ES) does not want RTD to cut off Evergreen community from the Federal Center/W Line.
RTD should work on advertising the routes and maybe consider a different schedule to attract additional
riders.
James Malek (CS, CV, and CX) wanted to know if the 100L additions would be coming up the mountain
to service the community.
Sandy Bowen (ES) would like to keep the 2:15pm early trip from Civic Center to Federal
Center/Evergreen. is also concerned about the other students and employees around the Federal
Center if we cut service to that area.
Lance Bunch (EX, ES, and EV) wants to keep the Federal Center stop as it’s his connection to the light rail
system. He does not want to have to go all the way downtown to catch a train. He also has a disabled
son that walks to his stop and gets off at the Federal Center to get around. Losing that connection
would be very difficult on him.

Balaji Srinivagan (CS, CV, CX, EX) wanted to know if we have plans to connect Evergreen/Conifer to the
Tech Center. If he wants to take transit to the Tech Center, he currently has to go to Civic Center Station
and then make his way to light rail. He wanted a stop at I 25 and Broadway?
Ed Furlong (CS) wanted to remind RTD how much the Federal Government supports RTD by giving their
employee transit benefits. He also thinks the other mountain riders would be will to make the stop at
the Federal Center, if it meant they could keep their service.
Darin Autry (CS) does not need the Federal Center stop but wanted to go on record to say that he would
be willing to make the stop so other riders that need it could keep their access. He also thinks RTD could
advertise the service better.
Monica Bunch (ES) doesn’t understand why RTD would cut service when there is such a push to get
people out of their cars. The Federal Center reduction would also hurt local mountain business by
making it harder to get employees up the mountain from Denver.
Andy Manning (ES) Andy is a 10yr rider and would consider the reduced number of trips if it meant they
could keep the Federal Center stop. He also wanted to know if we could use smaller buses to save
money. Finally, he wanted to recommend additional training for our drivers so they don’t leave stops
early. He said it is incredibly frustrating to get to your stop on time but miss your bus because the driver
left too early.
Gisele Hall (CS, ES) agreed with the comments made about keeping the Federal Center as a stop. has a
special needs daughter that uses the Aspen Park stop to get to the Federal Center, where works at St
Anthony’s Hospital. Her daughter can ride the bus if it’s a direct trip but can’t make multiple transfers.
The ability to take the bus to work has changes her daughter’s life for the better and would hate to lose
the Federal Center access.
Sasha Heinen (ES, EV, EX) Transit should be about coverage and not just about ridership.
Recommended we possibly run buses from the mountains to the Federal Center and not go all the way
to Denver.
Mitchell Beu (EX) wants to keep the Evergreen loop and possibly add a few additional stops in
downtown Evergreen to increase ridership. He also recommended that RTD consider changing the
routing if the current routing isn’t generating enough ridership.
Dean Miller would like us to look at advertising is local papers such as the Canyon Courier. He said
advertising in such papers would be fairly inexpensive and would reach a lot of potential riders that
don’t know about RTD.
Sarah Long spoke to the meeting attendees to get them to start spreading the word about RTD and the
transit service available to them.
Ed Furlong wanted to remind RTD that the data we looked at were from a time when gas was fairly
inexpensive and now that gas prices are rising, more people will likely ride the bus. He also does not
want to lose the Federal Center stop because he will use it to get to the airport when the big I 70
construction project starts. He will take the W Line from the Federal Center to Union Station and catch
the A Line to the airport.

Leigh Simmons said that he is willing to make the deviation to the Federal Center even though he does
use the stop…he just wants to keep the Federal Center as a stop. Additionally, he wanted to remind RTD
that transit should be viewed as a service and not as a profit making endeavor.
Anna Wilson would like to see more RTD “Green Buses” used in the mountains.
Lance Bunch wanted to ask about what additional stop consolidation may take place on the remaining
routing.
Jeremy Rauch is a special needs rider that does not have a car and needs the Federal Center stop to
access the RTD system and the school in the area.
Sasha Heinen wanted to remind RTD how impactful service reductions are to those without access to
other forms of transportation such as a car. also said that a few of the reverse commute trips are not
listed on the RTD website. (RTD will look at this and correct if true)
Mary Baker asked about what data was looked at when consider service cuts.
Hila Haslous wanted to know if special district tax money was factored in when looking at service cuts.
April Odell does not like the proposed schedule for the ES and CS. would like to have earlier trips as
well as a few late trips so those that work downtown can have a little time after work to run errands or
eat dinner before catching a bus back to the mountains. For many, RTD is their only option.
Kimberle Burke does not drive and needs RTD to get to work…please keep the Federal Center Stop.
She also would like RTD to investigate why we can’t keep drivers which may help with the driver
shortage.

There were 6 members from the public in attendance, along with RTD Staff members Daniel Merritt and
Jessie Carter.
Douglas Steinshouer has concerns about the proposal affecting service on Route CS. He has used RTD to
commute to the Federal Center for the past 20 years. He was a Route 5X customer before it was
replaced by light rail service. He believes service to the most densely populated areas in Denver are
being diminished in favor of rail service to the suburbs; he offered the cancellation of the Route 2 as an
example. His current trip on the Route CS takes just 50 minutes to 4th Union, where the alternatives
would take up to 1.5 hours. He sees multiple fail points in RTD’s planning efforts. He stated that the
reasons no one rides the service to the Federal Center is due to the scheduling and the reliability of the
service. He also criticized the placement of the W Line alignment, which he said was placed where
people could not access the line. The Golden Triangle would have been a better location for a station on
the W Linein his opinion.

Vicki Harimon wanted to better understand and express her concerns over the recent change in
operation of the D and L Lines. She stated that she wanted to see more evening service on the D Line to
offer service for workers who have to wait for transfers to the C Line from the H Line in inclement
weather conditions. She also requested better scheduled connections between the H and C Lines.
Irene Gorak uses the Route 27 along Yale that is proposed to be discontinued. She and her husband use
the service to connect to the rest of the RTD system and would not have a viable way to connect to Light
Rail without the Route 27. She lives in the “City” and believes their needs are not being paid attention
to. The change to the service would have a big impact and it is frustrating.
Jon Gorak accompanied Irene Gorak
Chris Diehn had general questions concerning the operator shortage and is wondering what RTD is going
to do about it. He noticed the changes proposed for Routes 20 and 40 and wondered if those were due
to the operator issue.

Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos and Tegan Rice. There were 6 members from the public in
attendance, along with a City of Boulder and Boulder Transit Center staff members. There were no RTD
board members.
Barry Weiss wants RTD to get aggressive and go to public for a bond or some alternative forms of
funding. Mr. Weiss is upset that every change listed in the brochure is a cut of service, every cut in
service is a result in dropped ridership. He is also upset about stop consolidation, and does not
understand why RTD is causing a greater inconvenience to passengers who already walk a considerable
distance just to access the bus. Mr. Weiss did not understand why RTD has to contract out services, He
stated that contractors provide horrible customer service, resulting in reduced ridership.
Kevin Mooney has to go to the airport, and cannot afford to miss his plane. He is concerned about the
elevator at the bridge at US 36 & Broomfield Station being broken resulting in him to missing his bus.
Mr. Mooney wanted to know if there is a number to call and see if the elevator is working at Broomfield.
The elevator is often broken and it can be an hour sometimes before he can get a bus ride over to the
other side of the bridge.
Mr. Mooney thinks that RTD needs to provide tours for new operators to become more familiar with
routes. He has been on buses where the operators are not familiar with the area and got lost.
Being in a wheelchair Mr. Mooney is not able to board the FF1 at Gate 1 in Downtown Boulder Station
(DBS). He was wondering if there are plans to change DBS to be more ADA accessible. He also state that
the bathrooms at DBS are disgusting; “they are really bad.”
Mr. Mooney recently rode the 120 and the 128 and really likes the rerouting. The rerouting gets him to
US 36 & Broomfield Station much faster. The stop at 105th and Arapahoe in Lafayette is dark and it’s
hard for the bus drivers to see passengers. He asked if something could be done about the lighting.
Also, there is a large planter at 3rd & Spader in Broomfield blocking ADA access to the bus stop.

Helen Bushnell Lafayette is throwing out a lot of development that is making it unsafe for pedestrians
and the buses to continue to maneuver along the current routings. The same for Louisville. She stated
that buses should no longer operate up Main Street; since it is congested and unsafe for buses to
continue to drive on Main St.
MS. Bushnell has noticed that ridership is dropping on the local routes. She feels that it is due to the
contracted companies not being fully trained the operators have poor customer service skills, they often
do not even know how to deploy the lift for ADA passengers. She specifically noted the route 32. Ms
Bushnell has noticed a high turnover rate of drivers. She does not understand why RTD only operates
some routes and contracted services only operate other certain routes; and why one run board RTD will
operate the route and the next it is done so by First Transit. She feels that bus balancing between
divisions needs to be communicated to the public. She also mentioned that the stop in Lafayette near
the Library, east of 287 westbound is difficult for the operators to see passengers at night due to very
low lighting.
Laura Konyha was curious about CU’s plans for a pedestrian bridge to provide the connection to 30th
and Marine since it will no longer be served by the STAMPEDE. She was also curious as to the schedule
would be which CU would providing as the missing connection of the STAMPEDE to 30th and Marine.
Elaine Erb wants better connections from Niwot and Longmont to the airport. What RTD currently
provides is not convenient. She is also concerned about Uber drivers picking up passengers at RTD park
n rides who are waiting for an AB. Her husband was picked up with four others by an Uber driver while
waiting for the bus at DUS.

Dianne Syndet thinks the board and schedulers need to ride more in order to see how poor connections
impact the public. Thinks we need more drivers and stronger dress codes (due to men’s hair choices).
Thinks we need more clocks and restrooms at LRT stations. Clocks we have are inaccurate. Thinks the 3
needs to go through Windsor Gardens more, even though she doesn’t live there or ride it.
Juan Marcano moved near the R Line for convenience, but feels the commute downtown keeps getting
worse. Poor connection to the A Line because of delays caused by traffic signals at Alameda and 33rd
Ave. Wants something similar to the ART Shuttle to help with first/last mile connections.
Mac Callison (City of Aurora) defended the decision to have no grade separation on the R Line at
Alameda because it was better for TOD, even though they knew it would negatively impact the
usefulness of the line. Said he would not consider altering the traffic signal timing at those intersections
because of heavy traffic volume on Alameda and the need to maintain signal progression. Suggested
that TOD can provide a solution to no public restrooms at LRT stations along the R Line.

I cannot believe how you keep moving the stop locations for the Y
stop for the # 10 route on 15th street going West. It doesn’t matter
what you say they are doing in other cities, this is about Denver and
being able to have time to make connections to buses or train
connections to get to our jobs. It also is about the safety of the bus
locations, are they well lit (most are not) are they kept cleared in
bad weather (most are not, snow, ice, hail etc.) and do you even
think about the time frame a person of any age with or without
disabilities it will now take to get from one stop to another to make
connections. When you ride the bus and the train you hear people
complain all the time about the late buses or trains stopping
without being informed why.
I have been a rider on the number 10 route for a long time, in fact
since 1991 and before that from about 1975 to 1989. I have to take
a bus downtown and switch to a train to get to my job out south
located near the Colorado Station. This is the most safe way I can
get to work. It already takes an hour and that is only if the trains
and buses are on time going to my job and returning from it.
Walking another 3 blocks or 5-6 in the morning downtown is not
allowing me to get to my train from the bus on time.
You make all these changes, so why don’t you get some better bus
drivers, and for the ones that know the route now and the
customers, DON’T make these drivers change every 3 months! Stop
raising the prices too…
If I could afford to, I would not being using this mode of
transportation anymore because of all the bad service and horrible
changes that keep taking place, but I have no choice nor do most of
the people that ride with RTD.
I was wondering if you could tell me why the schedule for the Bus
10 was changed for the summer? In the afternoon the last bus is at
2:45 pm and the next one isn't until 9 pm. I'm part of the staff at
the Denver Aquarium and we are very concerned how employees
and guests will be able to come and leave the Aquarium with the
new hours. Is there anyone that we can have a meeting with to see
if there is something we can do to accommodate the mass amount
of tourist we are counting on coming our way this summer and for
the staff we rely on to run the Aquarium? Thank you for any help
you can give me and have a great day!
Please do not discontinue the 18th Ave and Downing St. bus stop
for the Southbound Bus 12! The route is used extensively by
participants coming to Metro Caring.

I would like to urge you not to reroute the Southbound 12 bus to
19th and Ogden. I am a volunteer at MetroCaring and know that
many of our clients rely on the bus system to get their monthly
groceries from our program. The change in bus stop makes it more
difficult for them to get their fresh and healthy food home,
especially for our clients who already experience mobility
challenges.
Please do not take away the stop by Metro Caring on the
Southbound 12 bus. This will make it really difficult for their
beneficiaries to walk to the bus with all of their groceries. Things are
already difficult enough for these folks. Let's not make it more so.
When you do the next set of service changes, is there any chance of
having the 12 southbound stop at 18th and Downing again? I rode
the bus from that stop every day, and it is right across from a large
food pantry where a lot of the people are elderly/disabled or have
heavy carts and have trouble walking the extra distance to the next
bus stop. If there had been a sign put up at the stop, I would have
protested at the time, but I didn't realize it was going to shut down
until it was too late. Please bring back the stop. Thank you!
I have been a volunteer at Metro Caring for a year and a half. I see
first hand how important its services are to the Denver community.
Please do not remove the Metro Caring stop on the Southbound 12
Bus. Moving/Re-routing the line to 19th and Ogden would make a
long walk for folks caring heavy groceries from the Metro Caring
pantry. Accessible transportation is key to helping those in the
community use Metro Caring's services and better themselves by
becoming more healthy and self-sufficient.
I am writing to oppose the bus consolidation and removal of the
stop that serves MetroCaring, Hunger Relief Center on the
Southbound # 12. The rerouting of this line to 19th and Ogden will
make for a very long walk for our neighbors that use MetroCaring
and have heavy groceries to carry. Please reconsider this
consolidation. I am along time volunteer at MetroCaring and this
consolidation will be a burden for our neighbors who shop in our
food pantry.
Please reconsider bringing back the stop at Denver Metro Caring
Concerning the potential removal of the #12 southbound bus line
stop in front of Metro Caring at 18th and Downing, I think is a bad
idea from a users standpoint. Many recipients have a lot to carry
and it is an added burden making them walk to Ogden St. Please
reconsider for the sake of your riders. Thank you,

Reconsider consolidating this route in a way that removes the
MetroCaring stop. MetroCaring provides a great service and many
people who utilize its service require public transportation. Do not
diminish the organization's meaningful work by limiting its access to
those who need it most. Keep the stop on bus 12 that is closest to
MetroCaring. Thank you.
I request that bus stop 10172 located on 12th Ave between the
intersections of 12th/Jackson St and 12th/Garfield St not be
removed from service this May or any other time. The reason for
this request is twofold. One, I have been using this stop for the past
10 years for my work commute from downtown. Two, there is a
disabled gentleman that resides on Jackson St that uses this stop.
He cannot walk without aid of a walker and is vocally challenged;
stop 10172 provides him with a direct and easily accessible route
home.
Dear RTD, please consider moving the bus stop back to Metro
Caring (south bound 12 bus) as the change impacts the people
served there, longer walks for people with heavy bags of groceries.
Thank you!
It was brought to my attention today that RTD is removing the stop
by Metro Caring on the southbound 12 bus. Please reconsider this,
since rerouting this stop will make it extremely difficult for people
who utilize Metro Caring for food needs, creating a longer walk for
those carrying groceries.
I read that RTD is planning to remove the bus stop near 18th ave.
and Downing St. This is right near Metro Caring, where many people
use the bus to bring heavy loads of food to their homes. These are
people who cannot afford to use other means of transportation.
And there are many people with mobility challenges using this stop.
Moving the stop even a block away would be a significant burden to
these people. PLEASE preserve this stop.
Through recent bus stop consolidation the RTD has removed the
Metro Caring stop on the Southbound 12 Bus. RTD has rerouted the
line to 19th and Ogden (instead of Downing). This would make a
long walk for Metro Caring participants carrying heavy groceries
from the Metro Caring pantry. Please consider this before making
any changes. Keep the bus top at Metro Caring!
I am writing in concerns to the southbound 12 bus being rerouted
to 18th and Ogden.
Metro Caring has hundreds of participants per day come into their
fresh food market pantry. Many lower income families rely on this
food and often need to transport 50+ pounds of food back home to
feed their families for a week.
By rerouting the bus to 19th and Ogden, families that were relying
on the southbound 12 bus will now have to carry 50+ pounds of
groceries to the next stop.

I hope that you will seriously reconsider the removing of the stop
near Metro Caring on your Rte 13 bus. Folks that can't afford food
should be able to use public transportation to visit places such as
Metro Caring. They simply can't afford other types of
transportation and need the ease of being able to get back on the
bus carrying their food without having a long walk. Please
reconsider your consolidation
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to eliminate the Louisiana and
Pearl eastbound bus stop for local route 12, considering this is at a
light rail station. Many, many people get on at this stop including
me multiple times per week.
My name is Rhiannon Lowery, and I am a 7th grader at Morey
Middle School off of 14th and Emerson, and your changes to the 12
bus strongly affect me. The reason that it affects me is because I
take this bus to school. In the morning I get off at 14th and Downing
with my Nana, and at 3:05-5:05 I go to 14th and Corona to go home.
Unfortunately however these are two stops you guys plan to
eliminate, which is a HUGE inconvenience to me, and many other
students of Morey and DSISD who take this RTD bus. I know that the
12 is a long route, so I propose, why not make a 12 L? Have it stop
at all the school bus stops, and the train stations, and any other
highly used stops on the usual 12. It will shorten the ride, and
ensure that there is one route with all of he bus stops, and one
route with only some of the stops. Thank you for your time, and I
hope you can take my idea into consideration.
Please reconsider your service change for folks visiting the Metro
Caring Food Pantry. Moving the bus from Southbound 12 bus to
19th & Ogden presents an extreme hardship to those folks caring
groceries from the pantry. At a time when demand on food banks is
continually increasing, it seems imperative that companies such as
RTD continue to support folks in need. Please, Please reconsider.
I’m writing to express my concern over the elimination of the stop
outside of Metro Caring. The new stop at 19th and Ogden is a
significant walk for someone carrying groceries from the food
pantry. Please reconsider this change as it will make getting healthy
food that much more difficult for so many people.

Have written to express my concern about the proposed elimination
of the 12 bus stop that serves Metro Caring. Moving this line/stop
will be very difficult for persons shopping at Metro Caring. Please
ensure this stop stays as it is.
Discontinuing this route at 18th and Downing is a major
inconvenience to clients and staff at Metro Caring. Please reinstate
this stop on the route
Why are you placing rider alerts. It is too far to walk to 20th and
Downing. You people are idiots.
I support the proposed stop consolidations for Route 12. I'm also
surprised you weren't able to consolidate the two stops northbound
on Downing Street between 31st and MLK. Likewise, I'd also
support consolidation of two close stops southbound on Downing
Street on either side of 34th St.
Against removing the busstop in front of Metro Caring. Many
seniors use this stop coming from the food bank and it will be very
difficult to navigate the changes.
Please keep this bus stop for me and my great neighbors, I use this
stop almost everyday, I don’t have a car or a bicycle right now and
this is my only way of transportation.
I am one of teacher working in difficulty service school area at
Montbello . Would you please keep 15' schedule for certain time of
weekdays' rush hours, for example 6:30am to 8am, 3:30pm to
5:00pm. In this case RTD can provide our students and teachers
better transfer service. As a teacher we can service students better.
To whom it may concern: Many riders need this stop! Bring it back!
It's much more convenient than the far side stop.
20th & Reed is the main bus stop for the Dept. of Revenue (DOR)
and drivers licenses etc. etc. the DOR address is Pierce St. but the
building covers 2 square blocks in each direction and everyone
knows you can only enter the DOR from Reed St. side. This bus stop
is for the convenience of every one who has mandatory business
with the DOR especially the handicapped that would have to travel
2 long blocks west and 1 block south up the hill, not to mention the
cross streets, parking lots and sidewalks during snow storms, if they
even get shoveled. I can offer a solution, remove the next
westbound bus stops at Teller St. both are dangerous in both
directions. There are no sidewalks and the eastbound bus stop is
literally 2 ft. higher than the road and the westbound bus stop is 2
ft. from moving traffic and no where to move without a side walk.
Removing the Teller St. bus stops would also help to keep the
westbound Vance St. bus stop for local riders, the daycare center
and as the last stop and connection to the northbound Route 76. I
will do my best to attend all service change meetings…Thank you
sincerely… JOSEPH J GERGELY

I am writing regarding the proposed changes to the Westbound 20
bus and the possible consolidation of the stop at 18th and
Pennsylvania Street. I am requesting that the stop remain on the
route as there is a bus shelter at this stop, which cannot be found at
the following stop at Grant Street. Having a bus shelter with awning
is particularly helpful in the winter months and helps to block the
harsh sun in the hot summer months. In addition, there are many
nearby apartments and businesses that benefit from this stop,
which is also fairly safe and clean. Since this stop has a bus shelter, I
ask that RTD reconsider the consolidation of the Westbound 18th
and Pennsylvania Street stop for the route 20 bus. Thank you for
your consideration.
I don't want you to remove the stop at 20th & Reed St. I take the 20
all the time, and it runs hot and has to kill time in downtown, so
why does this stop need to be eliminated?
As a volunteer at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science
(DMNS) on Thursday mornings, I am very dissatisfied with the
cancellation of the 20 bus, eastbound, from Union Station at
8:46am. I take the FF2 from Boulder Table Mesa P&R at 7:47am and
arrive at Union Station supposedly at 8:14am, but usually arrives
later. Thus theoretically, I could catch the 8:16am 20 bus; but
usually I don't. This means that I would have to wait until 9:31am
for the next 20 bus, an 1.25 hrs later than the 8:16 20. The last two
times I rode the 8:46am 20 before its cancellation there were more
than 13 and 11 riders between Union Station and DMNS. Please
reflect on this: you are supposed to be running a transportation
system. Everytime you cancel a route, a bus stop, or a bus run, you
lose customers. It's getting to be absurd. It is easy to get from
Boulder to Denver, but once there, one has limited options unless
one stays downtown. Please restore the 8:46am 20 bus.
I am opposed to discontinuing service between Englewood Station
and University Hills. I and other retirees who live in the University
Hills area use the Route 27 to travel to and from the Walmart near
the Englewood Station. Eliminating bus service on this stretch of
Yale would have a significant negative impact on all who have come
to depend on it.
The bus riders who live along this section of Yale and are
accustomed to using the Route 27 to travel cross town will be
greatly inconvenienced. If bus service along this section of Yale is
discontinued, it would mean having to make multiple bus/train
connections to travel between Englewood Station and University
Hills.
Please do not cut off this section of Yale as you separate the Route
27 into two routes. It is important to me and others that service
remain between Englewood Station and University Hills.

I would love to come in person to question RTD’s move on the
Route #27 but I have to work. I do not understand why you are
eliminating the portion of route 27 between Englewood Station and
University Hills? It is the only East / West Route that services that
area. The 21 is too far North and the 35 too far South. There are
always people on the bus in both the morning and evening. I will
have no to work as a result of this change without taking a two hour
round about way to get from home to work. Please explain why it is
being eliminated versus cutting back from every 30 minutes to
every hour? Wouldn’t it seem prudent to try a reduced service
first?
Regarding proposed changes for August, what are the total
expenses per year for the current Route 27; and how much money
per year do you expect to save by closing it between Englewood
Station and Colorado Blvd? I live near this part of Yale, and for many
years have used the 27 about every three weeks, usually to get to
businesses on Colorado Blvd. I estimate that on average there about
4 passengers on the bus when I use it, usually during mid-day. I can
use RTD to get to those businesses by an alternate way, involving
about a mile of extra walking. I am very sorry for anyone who has
used 27 to travel between the east and west sides of town. For me,
it's looking like good-bye to an old friend, Route 27.
I normally take the 27 from Monaco & Yale to Yale & University or
Yale and Broadway after reading your proposal for your August
service change it this look like this may be eliminated. This would
really effect me. I am a senior. Please do not discontinue between
Broadway & University Hills.
I want to express my concern with the proposed service change fo
rroute 27 bus for August 2018. It is stated on the flyer for the
proposed service changes that bus #27 will be changed to two buses
#26, and #27. It states that service will be discontinued between
Englewood Station and University Hills. This will majorly impact me
as I take this route for two different trips which would leave me
without bus service. I take the 327 from Yale and Monaco to Yale
and Univerity and transfer to the #24. I also take the #27 from Yale
and Monaco to Yale and Downing to go to Porter Hospital and
various nearby drs. offices connected to Porter Hospital. Please
consider keeping these routes open between Yale and University
Hills and Yale and Downing as there does not appear to be any
nearby alternate bus sevice for me if these changes occur.
The change proposed sounds good. One thing that needs to be
addressed is the fact the 27 tends to be late on weekends and it’s
hard to make connections. People do work on the weekend and
need to be on time.

I would like to comment regarding the route 37. I did not find this
particular service changes proposed, however I have a change I
would like to propose for this route. What I am proposing and
pushing for today is extending the "morning rush" frequency of
every 30 minutes by one additional trip westbound. Currently after
8:30 AM the rt 37 operates hourly from 40th/Airport. I propose
adding a 9 AM departure westbound from 40th/Airport. Currently
the driver of the eastbound trip departing 40th/Colorado at 8:03
AM pulls into the garage after arriving 40th/Airport at 8:57 AM. I
believe the addition of a 9 AM departure could be accomplished
fairly easily by having this driver departing 9 AM on a westbound
trip instead of pulling in. Thank you for your consideration. Please
feel free to contact me if you wish.

There are some stores in the University Heights shopping area such as Michael's and Joann Fabrics - that are the closest to my
home by transit. When I make such a trip, I might also stop at
nearby stores such as the King Soopers, Sprouts, Ace Hardware,
PetSmart or Office Depot. Since I work business hours, the only
chance I have to shop at these stores is evenings and weekends.
Thank you for preserving the existing 30-minute headway on
weeknights until 10 p.m. - these stores close at 9 p.m.
Since Route 46 does not run south of Colorado Station on
weekends, I wonder if it would be possible to do a similar time-ofday review and perhaps preserve the 30-minute headways say
between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., as with the Route 20 proposed service
change.
If it's not possible to preserve the 30-minute midday weekend
headways on Route 40, I hope you'd also explore options with the
proposed revisions to Route 27, such as extending it from Colorado
and Yale to Colorado Station, or working to have a staggered
schedule with 30-minute service on either Route 40 or the revised
Route 27 between University Heights and the Southeast Corridor.

Bus line 45 is very important to Denver Public Schools.Teachers and
students use this bus to get to and from school. I know students
who use this bus to get to school, and how they don't like walking,
because it's far, and the weather, it gets very hot or very cold. And
students have to carry big books in their backpacks, which I've had
to do, walking and it hurts my back. Students and teachers need the
bus line to run every 15 minutes in order for them to get here on
time to teach/learn. My biology teacher Miss. Grumley, uses this
bus line to get to work and to go home, the light rail is not close to
this neighborhood and bus line 45 is one of the few convenient
public transportation options. Changing the time would be very
inconvenient for lot of people, teachers and students and other
people who need to go places. Some students opted out of their
Montbello neighborhood school and go downtown and need line 45
to run every 15 minutes, other students who are outside of the
school bus boundary use line 45 to get to and from school, so please
consider keeping the time the same. Thank you for your time!
When the proposed schedule changes brochures were put on the
buses it proposed service only once an hour for the 46 on both
Saturday and Sunday. Now it appears that it is still proposed for
Sunday but not Saturday. There are a good number of people like
me that either work or do weekly shopping by bus on Sunday and
would be negatively impacted by the decrease in service . I am
sending this email on behalf of many other passengers on the 46. I
work full time and do not have a car and cannot attend any of the
meetings so am sending this e mail. Please keep the service at
every 30 minutes. Please also keep the extension to Clermont and
Yale.
This is my second comment reducing the service on Sunday to once
an hour.
This email is on behalf of other passengers who depend on the 1/2
intervals on Sunday. Some of them don't have computers or are
uncomfortable sending emails on their computer. They like I work
on Sundays and would have to go to work 1/2 hour earlier and
possibly wait 1/2 longer at the end of the day. This would be
especially impactful in the winter months. PLEASE, PLEASE don't
cut the service on Sunday to once an hour !

It is my understanding that the 85 bus route will be discontinued
due to low ridership. While there are some times the bus is not full,
there are other times it is heavily used. This route has been cut back
in recent years and as riders we have been forced to make other
arrangements to get to Mineral Station. This has contributed to the
lower ridership. Now our only option will be the Call-n-ride. That
service is a nightmare for riders. We rode it last week to test it out.
What is normally a 20 minute ride from Mineral Station to our stop
took 60 minutes.
The timing of the route is completely dependent on the number of
riders since the bus does not have a set route. At the end of the day
the additional timing is annoying. In the morning it would be
completely unacceptable, since there would be no way to actually
predict when you would arrive at the Mineral Station. It could be 20
minutes or 80 minutes. It all depends on the number of riders and
where they are to be picked up. It would be nearly impossible to
maintain any regular work schedule based on such an unpredictable
mode of travel.
I highly suggest board members ride this alternate service before
making the decision to eliminate the 85. I imagine after one such
ride, they would understand how that is a poor alternate to a
regularly scheduled route. One possibility would be to dedicate one
call-n-ride bus to run the same route as the 85 in the morning. That
would be predictable and manageable.
I’m writing to request that route 85 is not discontinued as proposed
in support of driver shortage. I attended the meeting on June 7th at
the Ken Caryl Ranch House to listen to concerned citizens. Route 85
provides an important service to outlying areas of the community
and pulls ridership to the light rail. This route also provides bus
service to the communities themselves, which is very important to
maintain. Removal or elimination of less successful services, such
as the call-n-ride, could be considered. There may also be
opportunities for reducing frequency of other areas. I’m sure much
of these options have been considered. Thank you for considering
to maintain route 85 since it is valuable to the southwest area. You
can contact me at 303-818-2717 or my email with any questions.

Along with all of the passengers whose only way to get to the
Mineral station is route 85, I am asking you to please NOT
discontinue this route.
I have talked to so many who have been relying on this bus to get
the light rail station. It seems like a lot of us might lose our jobs if
we do not get to work on time. Even with the South Jeffco is
available as an alternative, there is no guarantee that we will be at
work at our scheduled time.
If ridership is the basis of this proposed service cut, why Route 85?
This route has so much better ridership than route 77. I have been
watching and comparing these two routes since RTD posted the
proposed changes.
It seems like this route (formerly 401) has always been the target. I
also have seen a lot of new faces on Route 85 in addition to us who
have been taking this Route 85 since 2000 or even before that.
I am asking asking a huge favor on behalf of the so many of your
customers dependent on Route 85 to please NOT DISCONTINUE
ROUTE 85. Hoping for a positive outcome,
Emailing about the proposed service change on Route 85. I have
been a rider for probably 15 years and yes, have seen the ridership
go down in the past few years.
We saved this route before and I sure hope we can save it again.
The service was cut back to a few rides in the morning and a few in
the afternoon. Can we do that again? I would love to not have to
rely on Call and Ride every day. Could we have rides on the hour,
not half-hour? The bus I take in the morning usually has 6 or 7
every day. I believe we have more than Route 77 every day.
Anyway, just wanted to email this morning as I will be unable to
attend the meeting at the Ranch House tonight. I am hoping that
you will re-consider this proposal once again. I will continue to
email. Please save our route.
I support renaming the Route 90 Limited from Civic Center Station
to US 36 & Sheridan Station as Flatiron Flyer Route FF7.
It is disappointing that you have opted to eliminate the bus stop
on the corner of Alameda and Chambers which was convenient
because it was closer to the buildings all along such as the strip
malls across the way, but also near the Municipal building. The
area in general is much safer to get off at because it runs along a
main thoroughfare, and provides much better lighting. The stop
which was put in its place, turns into an open field has no bench,
has no lighting. I experienced this just the other night and was left
off in front of an open field at night. Can there at least be a light
placed at the stop? Preferably, it would be appreciated if RTD
considered making Alameda/Chambers an active stop again for the
route 153.

Due to the fact that I was still at work while the meeting at Alfalfa's
was taking place tonight, I am sending my thoughts via email.As a
Boulder native, I have been riding the bus all my life, and very
specifically, the 204. The 204 has always gotten me where I need to
go, with convenient arrival times and good stop placement. I took
the 204 to Middle School, High School, Downtown on weekends to
meet up with friends and family, and now to work in Central
Boulder. With your proposed weekend service change, that ride to
work would become more of a nightmare situation than one of
extreme convenience. In the summer, a little longer of a walk (your
suggested extra walk of 1/4 mile to Broadway) is do-able, if
inconvenient, given that I have to wake up early as it is - not to
mention having to connect with the fairly unreliable arrival times of
the HOP, in hopes of getting to work on time - if the HOP isn't
regular, that's an extra 20 minute walk from the Station. In the
winter, forget about it. I work on Saturdays, which is why your ideas
would effect me (and the countless other people who work
Saturdays, like the wonderful Ready To Work program, who, if I'm
not mistaken are City employees...wouldn't the City want their
buses to get their employees to work on time?). Not sure where this
"low ridership" on weekends info is coming from, but I invite you to
ride the bus with us on Saturdays so you can see that's simply not
true. Also, it wouldn't just effect my ride to work. It would also
make the (currently) simple commute to North Boulder to help my
mother tiring. From my house on South Broadway, without the 204,
that would be AT LEAST two buses. As I mentioned before, this
wouldn't only effect me. On Saturday mornings, I see elderly
people, people who bus/bike, people headed down for a shopping
trip to the Farmer's Market, some students headed to Campus for
summer classes, mothers and fathers with children, People going to
Breakfast/Brunch on the Pearl Street Mall, and the aforementioned
Ready To Work program participants. That doesn't sound like low
ridership to me. That sounds like less shifts for the drivers who work
for RTD.We pay taxes for these buses, and they should be made
ALWAYS available to the citizens of Boulder, and so we can continue
to decrease the amount of cars on the road. Boulder used to have
one of the best transit systems in the US. What's happened??
This is a concern about the August Service Changes. I have tried to
email and call my board member, Natalie Menten, and have not
heard anything back. I commute from Federal Center Station to
Civic Center. I think it's ridiculous that you're cutting three bus
routes down to one to go between those places. You say you're
adding five trips between Federal Center & Civic but do not specify
when those will be. The W-line plus FMR is NOT a viable alternative
for me, because it would add an hour and a half to my day. I will not
just give up time that much time with my kids. I will just drive since I
can afford it. That is what 95% of people who need to use these

routes will do. You need to find a viable alternative rather than
cutting so much at once.

This letter is being sent to you requesting reconsideration of RTD's
decision to eliminate the bus stop on Colfax and Wadsworth Nearside. As a community member for many, many years, and RTD
rider for over 5 years, I feel that this was an unfavorable decision.
Many fellow riders on the 16L utilize this stop every evening as we
make our journey home after long days in the office. Many of your
16L riders park at the Park-n-Ride on 14th and Wadsworth. As you
know, crossing the intersection at Colfax and Wadsworth can be
dangerous at times. Further, crossing at 14th and Wadsworth
proves dangerous at times also. I have personally witnessed several
accidents in both intersections.It is my opinion that eliminating this
bus stop puts your riders at an increased and unnecessary risk. By
eliminating this stop we are now required to cross these busy
intersections three times. First, across Colfax, second, across
Wadsworth, and finally across 14th, if parked at the parking garage.
Also, many disabled riders utilize this stop as it is in very close
proximity to Walmart. By eliminating this stop these disabled riders
are now required to cross back over Wadsworth to make their way
to Walmart. This can prove to be fatal.If any stop on this particular
route should be eliminated it should be the farside as this stop
appears to be less utilized.I have had many conversations with
fellow riders that echo this concern and we are hopeful that RTD
will reconsider and put this stop back on the schedule.Thank you for
your time and consideration.This letter is being sent to you

I support the restructuring of the bus service along the Evans Ave
corridor in principle. The availability of the Southeast and
Southwest Corridors provides a potentially faster alternative for
travel between Evans Station and Colorado Station.
Given my experience with L Line trips being reduced between Board
approval and the final January 2018 schedule, you'll have to forgive
my skepticism about the District's ability to guarantee that "Service
hours and frequency would remain similar to current service,"
especially in light of the ongoing bus driver shortage.
In the longer term (maybe five to 20 years), I wonder if there might
be potential demand for a light rail service to supplement the
branches south of Broadway Station. Possibilities might include:
1. Englewood Station to Southmoor Station
2. Englewood Station to Florida Station
3. Lucent Station to Florida Station
4. Lucent Station to RidgeGate Station
I know that the track configuration south of Broadway Station has
been used for this type of service as Southeast Corridor trains go
into service from Elati Yard. Would the configuration support a
regular 30-minute or 15-minute headway service?
I also realize that while Englewood Station might make sense as a
short-turn terminus, operating in this manner would likely require
construction of a tail track (am I using the correct terminology)
south of Englewood, similar to the tracks south of Southmoor
Station. I don't know if right-of-way is available, but if it is, I
presume that such a project would have a similar capital cost as the
pocket track added at the Central Platte Valley Junction a few years
ago.
Ever since the 4:55 PM bus was removed there has been
overwhelming crowding on the 5:10 and 5:25 buses. Most days
there are at least 5-10 people that are required to stand while the
bus navigates top speeds on I-70. This poses major safety concerns
for those standing. With the numerous delays to the G Line, Arvada
bus options should not be cut back in this time of need. The
passenger demand clearly exists to bring back the 4:55 bus. Thank
you for taking the time to read my feedback and considering ways
to make the bus service better from Arvada to Denver. I appreciate
everything you do to bring great public transportation options to
our city.

I would like to **Requestthat the 4:55 p.m. return from Union
Station to Olde Town Arvada be reinstated. With the current
growth of the area, all 55L buses seem to be getting more crowded
everyday. However, the 5:10 p.m. has been exceptionally full. Most
days there are multiple people left standing for the 20+ minute ride.
Yesterday, the bus arrived at Union Station a couple of minutes late,
and there were people standing all the way to the back of the bus.
Having a 24 minute gap between the 4:46 p.m. and the 5:10 p.m.
during peak rush hour doesn't make sense. Please consider
reinstating the 4:55 p.m. to ease the congestion for the rush hour
commuters.
I am a City and County of Denver employee who works at
Denver International Airport. This year the city has made the Eco
pass available at a very attractive rate, to encourage employees to
use RTD transportation to get to work. For the last 5 weeks I’ve
been riding the AT bus. I normally work swing shift 2:00pm –
12:00am (midnight). I catch the 1:03pm bus, from the Arapahoe
Village center station to DIA and return on the AT bus that leaves
DIA at 12:15 am and gets to the Arapahoe Village Center Station at
12:52am, one of the proposed stops to be dropped. I live in
Highlands Ranch, so the Arapahoe Village Center Station Park – N Ride is extremely convenient to get in and out of, has more parking
than Nine Mile and saves me 8 miles each way (16 miles roundtrip)
from Nine Mile. Usually, at the 12:52am drop off, at the Arapahoe
Village Center Station, there are 2-3 employees and 2-3 passengers
with their luggage. A considerable amount of flights land at DIA
between 10:00pm and midnight. While the numbers are low it is a
nice option for both employees and the traveling public. I don’t
think RTD does enough to promote the AT bus. Covered parking at
$2/day if you’re in the RTD district is a heck of a deal and the AT bus
is convenient for people that live in Castle Rock, Castle Pines, Lone
Tree, sections of Parker, unincorporated Arapahoe County,
Highlands Ranch, Littleton, Centennial, Englewood and South East
Denver. With Just two stops to get to the airport, the AT bus
outperforms any other rail or bus option to get to the airport
quickly. Why aren’t these advantages played up by RTD to increase
ridership on the AT line?
With the proposed last two stops at Arapahoe Village Center Station
being dropped (12:52am and 1:52am), I am forced to drive to Nine
Mile. Getting to work from Arapahoe Station is not an issue it is
returning from work. I was hoping that I could hop on the R-Line out
of Nine Mile to get back to Arapahoe Village Center Station, but the
last train leaves Nine mile at 11:40pm. A full hour before my AT bus
would arrive at Nine Mile at 12:40am!
I understand ridership
matters, but I want to stress again that RTD could do a lot to help
itself by promoting the AT bus. It is convenient way to get to the
airport from the south metro area.

When looking at the upcoming light rail schedule changes, please
consider travelers trying to connect from the B line to E line.
Currently the B-Line arrives at Union Station at 7:54-7:56 (on an
every 30 minutes schedule). The E-Line departs the other set of
platforms (850 feet away) at 7:58 (on an every 15 minute schedule).
I can occasionally make the connection between the two platforms
by being the first person off the train at the closest door, crossing
Wewatta street regardless of the crossing light and running as fast
as I can. If the B-line is more than 45 seconds late, or there is heavy
traffic on Wewatta, I will end up missing the south bound E line by
seconds. This forces me to wait 15 minutes (for the next E line). It
also increases my commute by over 20%. If I miss this connection
consistently, I end up losing over 5 hours a month to this mismatch.
I know that I am not the only person who takes the B-line to the Eline. Please consider the timing between these two routes. Moving
the B-line’s arrival by as little as 2 minutes earlier would greatly
improve the commute for the many riders who take this route.
I find this bus stop useful when coming back with groceries; that
way I do not have to cross Quebec which has a lot of traffic. The
shade of the trees in the park is also welcomed in 90+ weather.
Thank you for proposing to increase the frequency of service of the
"C" line, especially during rush hour. While it is regrettable that "D"
line service must be decreased to accommodate increased
frequency of "C" line, service, hopefully going to four-car trains will
adequately offset the reduction in frequency of "D" line trains.
Thanks again for proposing this change.

For years I’ve been riding the H line to Broadway and transferring to
C or D going South to Mineral where I catch the 403 line. The H
usually comes in to the station just as a D line leaves. I’ve asked
customer service to see if the train could wait, especially if it sees
the H arriving at the station but I was told it needs to keep it’s
schedule. I asked if there would be anything I could do but was told
it is up to the driver of the D to determine if they can wait. Also
most never have I or the people trying to make the same
connection made the D. This is very frustrating as we seem to only
make the connection if the D line is late. I personally take an earlier
train so I have extra time to get to work on time, as I’m sure the
others do. When I do catch the D line it gets me to the 403 and to
my work 30 minutes earlier.
I have asked if a courtesy wait could be asked for at Broadway for
the D line and was told that is not an option. I asked about a hold
for the 403 and was told I would need to call each day and that I
would probably not make it in time anyway as they only hold the
bus a few minutes. I have been looking at schedules for the trains
and others around the country and found may other locations are
better timed. RTD however scheduled the connections, or lack
thereof, to specifically make travelers from Aurora to the Southwest
side miss the connections. Each H line train is scheduled to arrive
one minute after a D line is scheduled to leave. Can consideration
be made to align the connections to allow Aurora commuters to
make the connections? Have the D line arrive and wait and be
scheduled to leave at the same time (or following minute) which
would allow the connection? I have traveled at different times the
same route and see about half a dozen or more commuters in the
same situation. We would all be pleased not to need to wait 10 to
30 minutes because of poor planning. Other than that, I think RTD
is doing a great job.
Dear RTD Management and Board. Until this summer, I was a rider
on the D Line between the Littleton Mineral Station and Downtown
Denver. I truly appreciated the fact that there was a train every few
minutes due to the fact that there were both the 18th and
California Line and the 30th and Downing line. This summer, my
Firm moved to a LoDo location close to Union Station. I now ride
the C Line between Mineral and Union Station. The convenience of
being near Union Station is nice, however, the 30 minute span
between trains is trying. One evening last week I was validating my
ticket just as the doors closed and the train departed. Having to
wait a half hour for the next train was frustrating enough but there
are also times when it is difficult to get a seat on the busy train.
Some days people are squeezed in like sardines. Following a Rockies
game, the platform is like a mob scene and some people take on a
mob attitude trying to get on the train. I think it would be

For the most part - I am onboard with changes to C & D lines. The
one change I am not in favor of is discontinuing the services after
midnight. I believe it is RTD's civic responsibility to provide safe,
affordable transportation to the community. Reducing the service
after midnight will exclude individuals that live on the southwest
side of Denver from having safe & affordable transportation from
Denver after sporting events & concerts. RTD continues to deprive
the Southwest corridor of both bus and light rail services in favor of
those communities closer to the city of Denver. Ridership will
continue to decrease in these areas unless those same riders can
count of frequent, consistent transportation from bus/light rail
stations. I feel that RTD should consider that more affluent
individuals are moving closer to the city of Denver that can afford
Uber, Lyft & taxis while individuals who are less affluent are
continually losing frequent, consistent transportation services to
access Denver & DTC services.

I am writing again to express my sincere concerns about the
proposed elimination of some of the D line trains during peak
periods and the “replacement” with additional C line trains and four
car trains on the remaining D line trains. I have been a commuter
from Littleton Downtown Station since its inception and, during
peak periods, I have observed that the D line service is frequented
by about 75% of the passengers, with the C line only frequented by
the remaining 25%. Union Station is not central. Even during the
Summer Semester at the Auraria Campus, the peak period D line
trains are consistently crowded, with most seats gone by the time
the trains leave the Englewood or Evans stations going northbound,
and usually the southbound D line trains are standing room only at
the Convention Center or Auraria Campus stops. The proposed
“addition” of an extra car to the remaining D line trains is a nonentity because during the Fall and Spring Auraria semesters it
seemed to me that many of the peak period D line trains had four
cars last year. This year so far, there are typically only three cars on
the D line trains which is a reduction not an addition. When there
were four car trains, the D line was crowded and seating for people
who go to work in downtown Denver was very limited indeed.
However, even given the fact that D line train seating is limited,
passengers still do not use the uncrowded C line trains to
downtown, because, as far as I can see, most passengers prefer to
use the D line service, probably because it is more convenient for
their office location and it is more central than Union Staton. I use
the Convention Center station downtown and D line service is more
convenient for me. Going southbound, having to use the Southeast
line trains and change at I25/Broadway is not an option for two
reasons: first, the Southeast Line trains are already overcrowded
when they leave the Convention Center / downtown area, and
secondly, the need to change at I25/Broadway to catch a C line train
could add as much as 15 minutes each way to my morning
commute, and would probably add 30 minutes to my evening
commute as I would probably miss my bus connection at Littleton
downtown station. In addition, changing trains at I-25/Broadway
would be especially difficult during inclement weather. In addition,
the front car of the D line trains is almost always overcrowded with
people with disabilities during peak periods, and often those people
with disabilities have to stand which is dangerous if the train has to
make sudden stops. This overcrowding in the front car occurs now
when there are six D line trains an hour during peak periods, and
cutting that number of trains down to four and adding an extra car
to the remaining D line trains will not help this problem, it will only
exacerbate it. For the above reasons, I strongly question the
proposed reduction in D line service and replacement by additional
C line service from January 2018. Providing additional C line service
would increase service for sporting events, etc., but it would

Recently it has come to my attention that you are going to cancel
the West bound CS bus routes in the morning and the East bound
CS bus routes in the afternoon. I am confused as to why you would
do this when we have so many taking the 5:40, 6:40 and 7:10 bus to
get from the city to the Denver Federal Center Station for work.
One or two of the regular riders have serious handicaps that
prevent them from driving. Why are you doing this? We depend
on this route to get to work everyday, and really need it especially
in the winter. Taking the W line is not advantageous to most of us
because the connections to get to it from the city add over an hour
to our one way commute.You mentioned the 100L would still run,
but is is duplicating the schedule you are reducing the CS to, with no
service for West bound morning commuters.So, now none of us
traveling West in the morning from downtown Denver Civic Center
have a good route to get to work. You offer no solution to us, but
rather just cancel our main route of transportation. You want us to
use RTD and we pay taxes to use RTD, yet you are cutting off our
only direct route West in the morning when it matters the
most.Please do not discontinue the West morning and East evening
routes from the Civic Station to Denver Federal Center. Or change
the 100L to that route to go West in the morning and East in the
afternoon.The Denver Federal Center is huge and employees
hundreds of employees. This is not including the Fish and Wildlife
and Schools employees who also take the morning CS bus West.
We need a direct route from Civic Center to the Denver Federal
Center station such as the CS or 100L for our morning commuters.
Please do not drop the CS line to the Federal Center, this is our only
access to the west side of Denver from Conifer. Right now I have 30
minute bus ride and then a 10 minute walk to work, which would
increase to a 1hr 30 min ride if I have to take the CV downtown and
then the W line back to the Fed center - ridicuouls - simple fact is
that I will no longer use RTD if this change is passed. I understand
the need to save $. Please just cut some of the times, put dont drop
the route all together - that doesn't make any sense at all. Thanks
I would like to say that I unfortunately couldn't make the public
meeting yesterday, but I did read about the changes for the CS on
your website. I am a rider who commutes every day on the CS from
Civic Center Station to Federal Center Station and then back in the
afternoon. Per your website, Route 100L: "It is proposed to add five
trips between Federal Center Station and Civic Center Station to
replace discontinued trips on routes CS and ES." I see that you
propose to eliminate the CS bus and add 5 trips on the 100L. I
would like to make sure I understand what I read correctly. The
same times that the CS would go from Civic Center (5:43 am, 6:40
am, and 7:10 am) would be added to the 100L line plus two other
times? Would times also be added in the afternoon (4:34 pm for
example) to return to Civic Center? The CS is my only option (I do

I would like to express my concerns about the cancellation/change
of the CS route to and from the Civic Center Station and the Federal
Center. With the new proposed schedule, it does not allow me to
travel from the Civic Center Station to the Federal Center in the
morning. This is crucial, as I take this mode of transportation 90%
of the year. I then take the same CS route from the Federal Center
to the Civic Center Station when I return home in the evening. The
new schedule does not allow people travelling from the Civic Center
Station to get out west in the morning and back east in the
afternoons. In fact, it is the complete opposite. I do not see how
this is cohesive with any one persons job schedule and is a major
inconvenience for myself and anyone who has used the CS route
over the years. And to top it off, there is no alternative that will
take its place. I am considering this an official complaint and look
forward to the news of the CS route staying on the current schedule
in the future.
I’m very disappointed at the plans to eliminate the CS Route.
Rather than have to ride all the way into downtown Denver and
backtrack out to Golden, are there plans to perhaps stop at the
Jefferson County Government-Golden Station instead of the Federal
Center Station? That way, folks that need to get into downtown,
can take the light rail?
What are my other alternatives to get from Pine Junction to
Golden/NREL, without extending my commute more than 15 or 20
minutes?

I live in the Capitol Hill area (7th and Washington) and work in the
Green Mountain area of Lakewood (near the Federal Center). I
catch the CS westbound and 8th and Broadway at 7:10 am and then
the CS eastbound at Federal Center Station at 4:30 or 5:30 pm each
work day. (Straight line distance about 11 miles) (Previously, I had
commuted on the 5x until it was discontinued when the W line was
completed.)
Because of the configuration of the W line it is not a viable
alternative to the current CS service. When I take the W line it adds
45 minutes each way to my commute time, almost double the 50
minutes that it now takes me to walk to the bus stop, ride the bus,
and walk home.
If I take the W to or from Union Station I have to find my way
through downtown during rush hour traffic. Catching 0 or 6
downtown - net transit time 110 minutes each way.
If I deboard the W at Auraria West or Pepsi Center it is just beyond
what I consider reasonable walking distance. There is no connection
from either station to my neighborhood. I can deboard the W at
Auraria West and then transfer to 10th and Osage - just within
walking distance of home. Net transit time: 95 minutes each way
I can deboard the W at Auraria West and then transfer to Broadway
Station and catch 0 - net transit time: 100 minutes each way I can
deboard the W at Auraria West and then transfer to Louisiana
Station and catch 12 - net transit time, depending on when the 12
runs from 110 to 140 minutes. It has been my experience that as
the light rail system is built out the entire RTD system becomes less
convenient, reliable and dependable. Apparently light rail works
very well for bringing suburbanites to Bronco games, but, for those
of us on the East and Southeast edges of downtown the RTD system
is becoming a transportation desert. If you discontinue these CS
runs, please schedule a replacement for those of us who make this
commute daily.
Hi, I'm writing regarding the planned changes to the CS route in
August, particularly the "reverse commute" trips originating at Civic
Center in the morning (going West to Fed Center) and at Fed Center
in the afternoon (going East to Civic Center). The proposed service
changes for route 100L state, "It is proposed to add five trips
between Federal Center Station and Civic Center Station to replace
discontinued trips on routes CS and ES. Under the proposed
restructure routes CS and ES would eliminate service between
Federal Center Station and Conifer/Evergreen." To clarify, are
some/all of these five trips on the 100L meant to take over the
reverse commute trips outlined above (W to Fed Center mornings, E
to Civic Center afternoons?). Thanks for your help clarifying this,

I am disappointed that RTD's first proposal is to eliminate riders'
ability to reach a major Park-n-Ride hub that provides access to the
rail, Red Rocks Community College, St. Anthony's Hospital, NREL,
Denver Federal Center, FWS, NPS, DOI, SSA, GSA and many other
government and businesses entities. Jefferson County Government
offices are also accessed by the mountain communities by riding to
the Federal Center Station and taking the W line to these buildings
for Jury Duty, DMV, and many county services that are necessary
just to live in Jefferson County.
By eliminating the CS Route you are also eliminating the potential
future business and activity those riders would bring to the Federal
Center Station area. I'm very surprised, with swiftly growing
populations, in the Denver Metro and mountain communities, that
RTD could seriously consider eliminating any services to these areas.
I request RTD continue with Route CS service as currently provided.
I am writing in opposition to the proposed RTD service changes for
Route CS from Conifer and Aspen Park to the Denver Federal
Center. The CS route provides a direct link for government
employees and contractors in the Conifer and other mountain
communities to take the bus to the Federal Center. Additionally, it
provides a transfer means to the RTD light rail and bus services at
the Federal Center Station for workers in the Golden, Arvada,
Lakewood and surrounding areas. There are also employer-specific
buses from the Federal Center Station to large sites like the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. There are several disabled people
who use this route to directly access the Lakewood area, including
St. Anthony's hospital. In addition, with gas prices rising, there are
more people who need this service instead of driving. The
alternative proposed by RTD is unacceptable as it requires taking
the CV bus from Conifer to the Civic Center Station, then taking a
bus to Union Station, and then the W Line back to the Federal
Center Station. This adds 70 minutes to the trip. With transfers,
this would be almost two hours from Conifer. Please note my
opposition to the elimination of the direct service to the Federal
Center Station.

As a loyal RTD patron, long time rider I appreciate RTD and what is
offered to our community. RTD provides a valuable service and
plays an important role in the lives of many. I am surprised to hear
of this request to move the 628am bus to an earlier time, by 20
minutes. I tend to catch an earlier bus. In light of this proposal I
chose to ride said bus this morning. Seems to be a popular time.
Rough count, about 18 riders boarded at Pine Junction. With three
more stops on the trip into Denver, the bus was quite full. In
speaking to other riders, its my understanding the person
requesting this change normally rides the 546am bus. Only
interested in the 628am being changed to 610am as a backup for
when she is running late. I too have those mornings but do not see
this as anyone else’s responsibility or to be addressed at the
expense of others. Many times I have taken the CS at 557am,
changing busses in Aspen Park to the 617am CV. There are four
departures offered in the 5-6am hour from Pine Junction. Three
more 628am to 705am. Seems to be adequate options for those
on a regular schedule. So what I am saying is I am not
understanding why a schedule that would effect so many be
changed for one rider. And as a backup for when she is late is even
more puzzling.
We have just been made aware of the subject proposed change,
and want to share with you that this would be a hardship, and a
step backward for commuters. Kindly see my attached comments
and reasons for requesting this change NOT be approved. We need
the CV @ 6:28 a.m., and hope you will consider our position. Thank
you for all you do.
I am not happy with your suggestion to eliminate the ES route. I
have been a faithful rider of the ES for the last NINTEEN years,
traveling from the Evergreen Park & Ride to the Denver Federal
Center. Please reconsider this proposed action.
Instead of offering the current three ES routes in the AM and the
five ES routes in the PM, you need to consider one to two in the AM
and two to three in the PM. Both actions will cut costs. Try these
changes for six months prior to making your proposed drastic
change. I am not happy about contributing tax dollars to RTD and
RTD eliminating my way to work at the Denver Federal Center. Since
you are a quasi-governmental entity, you need to consider the
needs of the population your serve.
It has come to my attention that you are planning to revise the time
I ride the CV in the morning. It is the CV leaving 6:28 am from Pine
Junction. This will create a hardship for me. I get a ride to the bus
in the morning from my husband who is heading to work at that
same time. Changing it to 6:10am will not work. As a result, I will
have to sit at the park-n-ride till the 6:49 when the next bus arrives,
which will get cold considering this is during the winter. I did not

Have 2 routes in AM and 2 in the evening.2nd optionAdd 2 stops at
the Denver Federal Center in the AM and 2 stops in the evening on
the CV3rd optionCut the CS lines from the DFC to downtown. If
you're trying to encourage participation on the W light rail, get
people to use it!If no other options are considered, what is the
community of Conifer's option for getting to the DFC? Will you offer
a commuter van? Please consider all options for our foothills

I am unable to make it to the public meeting this evening in
Evergreen so wanted to clarify some questions I have regarding the
proposed changes for route EV/ES/EX.
“It is proposed to eliminate service on Route ES between Federal
Center Station and Evergreen.”
I want to confirm that you do NOT plan to do this for Route EV? I
utilize the drop-off at Federal Center Station on this route 2-3 times
per week.
“It is also proposed Route EX would provide two trips in each
direction, and Route EV would provide additional trips in each
direction.”
I would sincerely appreciate the additional trips on the EV – would
running them throughout the day also be an option?

I write to you to express my concern over the proposed shift of the
CV trip leaving Pine Junction from 6:28 am to 6:10 am. It appears to
have been slipped into this change proposal at the last minute,
possibly in an attempt to sneak this through without many public
comments. This change is not thoroughly posted on the bus
walls/windows for all riders to see, and merely contained in the
flyer. I believe this change is to accommodate the schedule of a
few, only to inconvenience the entire bus load of other passengers
who regularly ride this route at this time. If the few other riders
need to be into the Civic Center and into work by 7:30am , there is
another option of leaving on the 6:17am bus out of Aspen Park. I
do not believe a shift of the entire bus, only to benefit a handful of
people is in RTD’s best interests.
In addition, there are times during the winter when the bus does
not show up or is extremely late due to weather. When this
happens, with this proposed change, it could leave passengers
waiting almost an hour for the next bus. I feel the buses are spread
out an appropriate amount of time to accommodate all riders
schedules. If there is not a bus that arrives in Civic Center when you
would need to arrive, with a total of 4 stops along 285 you have
many other options and may just have to drive to another park &
ride. Please leave the CV bus schedule alone and do not make any
changes to this schedule or route. lease contact me if you need
any further comments or to discuss any other issues.
I use the Conifer bus routes and have looked over the proposed
changes and I do not agree with them. I realize and understand
making cuts for a budget but what is being proposed does not work
with me, and from what I understand other frequent riders. Using
public transportation is not supposed to be convenient, I know this,
but it should not be absolutely impossible to unusable. Especially
for this line going a bit further than most. Pease reevaluate your
changes. Side note why do the busses on these lines no longer have
bike racks? Please put bike racks back on them or at least make a
few dedicated bus times for bike rack availability.

It was just made aware to me that there is a purposed schedule
change for the CV bus currently leaving from the Pine Junction Park
and Ride at 6:28 a.m.. The proposed time is 6:10 a.m.. I would like
to reach out to someone with the authority to appeal this change
before it takes effect in January. The 6:28 a.m. CV currently carries
22 - 35 regular or semi-regular riders who depend on the bus at that
time in order to make it to work on time. The overall issue that the
purposed schedule change raises is that it is not conducive to a
regular 8-5 work schedule. Secondly, many of us travel through feet
of snow in the winter in order to make it to the 6:28 a.m. CV on
time. Occasionally, we miss it due to weather conditions or other
varying factors. With the current schedule there is a 21 minute wait
in sub-freezing temperatures for the next bus. With the purposed
schedule there is a 39 minute wait. This can pose a threat to the
older passengers who must endure this wait. Lastly, the passengers
who are picked up at the Twin Forks Park and Ride by the CV have a
37 minute time period between buses which will be extended to a
55 minute gap with the purposed time change. This also leaves a
scheduling issue with many that depend on the service of the
current CV for work. Please let me know how I may voice my
concerns most effectively in order to influence the decision not to
change the current CV schedule. Thank you for taking the time to
read my concerns. I look forward to your reply.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to
eliminate the CS and ES service. I have been riding the CS and ES
buses between my home in Pine Junction, CO, to Lakewood where I
work for over 10 years. In addition to the many federal employees
who live in Pine, Conifer and Evergreen and work in and around the
Denver Federal Center in Lakewood who rely on the CS and ES
buses, there are also many St. Anthony's Hospital and high school
students who use the CS and ES routes to have access to the Jeffco
schools in Lakewood. The proposal to cancel the CS and ES buses
would cause a massive disruption in the lives of all these people.
And to propose to address this disruption by relying on the 100L bus
routes and the W Line light rail is absurd. RTD is basically suggesting
that dozens and dozens of federal employees, St. Anthony's
Hospital employees and high school students should travel
downtown and double back to Lakewood on 110L and the W Line.
They will do no such thing. They will simply drive to work and
school. Surely, that is not the outcome RTD is looking for. it is a
profoundly bad idea to cancel the CS and ES lines. RTD just spent an
enormous amount of taxpayer money to re-do the Federal Center
PnR a few years ago. Now RTD is proposing to withdraw resources
from the Federal Center PnR. It simply makes no sense to cancel
these lines. Please don't cancel the CS and ES routes. Thank you for
considering my views.

I'm replying to the proposed service termination of the CS route
westbound in the morning, eastbound in the afternoon. Currently
this route is the only efficient way to get from the Federal Center
station to the Civic Center station hub. The Alternate service
recommendation indicates the W Line is available- the W Line is a
45 minute trip to Union Station, and an additional 25 minute trip on
the Mall ride- one hour and 10 minutes- to complete the trip made
by the CS in 25 minutes. I take this bus in the morning and in the
afternoon and on both trips there are several disabled people who
utilize this route daily as well.
The CS bridge between downtown and Union station is the only
thing making the trip from one end of Alameda to the other
reasonable. The 21 is a two hour long route that is absolutely
dangerous due to the other people riding that bus. Taking the R
light rail to the A line train to the W line is time consuming and
unreliable.
I continue to not understand why RTD does not provide more lines
that travel major streets as the 15L does on Colfax. It is a
requirement in getting from one end of town to the other to hop
from one bus to another to train to light rail, and the RTD busses
and trains are so unreliable that if you have to make a connection it
is likely that you will have to wait for at least 20 minutes as busses
are so frequently late or just don't run at all. To get from one end of
Alameda to the other I currently have to leave at 5:30am to be to
work by 7:30. A two hour bus ride is unreasonable but I choose to
commute this way, if the route becomes a 3 hour trip I'm afraid I
will not be able to continue.
I urge you to please reconsider terminating the westbound morning
and eastbound CS routes, it is currently the only efficient way to get
from Civic Center station Hub to Union Station.
I attended the meeting this evening at the Evergreen fire
department. I was not able to stay to make comments however
would like to make the following points:1. The time period you took
your census was right after the Civic Center came back up. I noticed
the ridership seemed to drop off significantly when the departure
stop was off of Broadway. It seems to be just coming back after the
disruption.2. It would have been very helpful if you would have had
handouts of the proposed times. Most of the people around me did
not have the information on the times since they were posted in the
front of the room and not accessible during the conversation. I
believe there would have been more conversation around
time/routes if this information had been available.3. Now that I
have seen the bus schedule it seems excessive that a bus runs every
20 minutes in the morning. I would think that the schedule could
be consolidated so that buses run every 45 to 1 hour arriving at
Civic Center at approx. 5:50, 6:50, 7:50, 8:50 or even 6:50, 7:50,
8:50.4. I agree that an on/off ramp stop at 6th and Simms would not

I attended the proposed schedule change meeting at RTD for the CV
route from Pine Junction to Civic Center and back again. Thank you
for adding a 6:10 AM bus at Pine Junction. This means I will no
longer have to get up at 4:30 AM to catch the 5:46 AM CV that
departs Pine Junction to get to work by 7:30 AM. The routes
proposed will knock off almost an hour and a half extra commuting

I am writing to oppose the elimination of the CS and ES bus routes
from Federal Center to Evergreen and Conifer respectively. I have
been riding RTD for over 18 years and have been overall pleased. I
realize routes must be periodically looked at for budget, drivers,
etc., and appreciate the opportunity to comment. Working south of
downtown I use the bus and the train; the 2:16 PM ES is very
convenient for commuting should I need to get home sooner, fall ill,
disabled husband has appointment(s), etc. I also have a friend /
fellow bus rider that rides this ES quite often, shoe shine business
downtown that starts winding down most days to be able to catch
the 2:16 PM. I also work with CDOT employees and they recently
moved their Headquarters to Federal and Decatur which is right by
the light rail, and many of them work west of the city, taking
advantage of these buses and light rail (RTD) (they used to drive). I
try and do a little bit of my part by using public transportation, to
help alleviate more cars on the road, get some downtime, lessen my
stress, etc. so losing this route would surely hamper my efforts. I am
hoping you will reconsider these route eliminations or at least not
completely; perhaps lessen the number of times each goes up the
hill, but still have them run few times during day. Also please
consider the safety factor when there is bad weather (I70, Hwy 285)
of having a trained safe RTD driver vs a handful more of cars, not
knowing whether or not they maneuver well in the ice, snow, wind,
and rain. I cannot attend the meeting in Evergreen, but again I
appreciate the opportunity to express my opinion and needs.
THANKS for ALL YOU DO!

As a long time rider of the CS/CV buses, below are my comments
regarding your proposed August 2018 service changes. I ask that
you consider not cutting out all CS stops at the Federal Center
Station. We currently have three eastbound morning CS buses that
transport riders from the mountain areas to Civic Center and which
make a stop at the Federal Center Station (buses arriving at Civic
Center at 5:48 a.m., 6:45 a.m., and 7:55 a.m.). I usually take the
7:55 a.m. CS and when we stop at Federal Center there’s anywhere
from 5 to 10 riders that exit at that station. I haven’t been on the
6:45 a.m. bus for a while, but I would think you might get about the
same for that bus. If you cut the stop at Federal Center Station then
you leave no alternative transportation for these customers. The
Federal Center Station is on the way and it provides a much needed
service. I agree with your proposed change of CX buses become CV
bus routes thereby stopping at the Twin Forks Park-n-Ride. The
Twin Forks Park-n-Ride is on the way and there have been many
times when passengers travelling eastbound in the morning have
been left waiting for long periods of time due to snow storms or
buses breaking down and we see a CX bus pass us by. We are then
left to wait for an hour or longer or have to drive down to Federal
Center Station to take a bus to Civic Center Station. Thank you so
much for making this change to help many passengers.
I agree with cutting out westbound morning trips for the CV/CS/CX
routes as I wouldn’t expect you would get more than one rider, if
any. I also agree cutting out eastbound evening trips on CV/CS/CX
for lack of riders.
We need this bus service to Evergreen. We are paying for it. Please
do not cancel it.

I am opposed to the proposed January, 2018 service change of the
CV/CS/CX route. I ask that you consider three points: First, please
re-check your departure and arrival figures for the proposed "shift"
to a 6:10am Pine Junction departure. The current CV runs to
downtown are both scheduled to take 60 minutes, which is accurate
on most days. Per your announcement, the proposed, new CV run
to downtown is scheduled to take 70 minutes. The earlier departure
would normally encounter lighter traffic, so this run would more
realistically take 60 minutes or less. Thus the proposed CV run
would arrive downtown, most days, at 7:10am. Second, like many of
my fellow passengers on the CV bus leaving Pine Junction at
6:28am, my work hours in downtown Denver are 8:00am to
5:00pm. We do not have flexible starting or ending work day
options. Currently, we arrive downtown at 7:28am. If this proposed
schedule change is made, the resulting Pine Junction departure
options are either to arrive downtown 50 minutes before the work
day begins or be 5 minutes late everyday. Everyone should agree
that either option is unsatisfactory. The current run is perfectly
situated for the 8 to 5 workers. This proposed change seemingly
may benefit one person or a few, but I cannot imagine the change is
welcome by the vast majority of this route's riders. Lastly, I am
concerned that RTD did not offer a public meeting location more
convenient for their customers most affected by this change: Pine,
Mountain View, Aspen Park, and Twin Forks riders. I hope that
future consideration will be taken when a proposed change impacts
your CV/CS/CX route customers.
I am writing to express my concerns with the proposed route
change to shift the CV route to leave Pine junction at 6:10 rather
than 6:28. I am very much against this change. First of all the CS,
CV and CX leaving Pine Junction currently arrive at the Civic Center
Station at 7:16, 7:38 and 8:05. Fairly well spaced apart. Your
proposals would change the arrivals to 7:16, 7:20 and 8:05. It
doesn’t make sense to have 2 buses arriving within 4 minutes and
the next bus 45 minutes later. In addition, for those of us who work
at 8:00, this means we are either 40 minutes early or 5 minutes late.
Many of us spend 2-3 hours of our day on the bus. The thought of
losing another 40 minutes each day in order to get to work on time
would for me be prohibitive. I would not be able to justify renewing
my ecopass next year and the resulting travel expenditures would
pose a significant hardship. The bottom line is that scheduling the
CV and CS 39 minutes apart is too long of a window for departure.
Having the CS and CV arriving within 4 minutes is inefficient and the
CX 45 minutes later is unreasonable.

Comments on CX/CV bus changes for August 2018: if reducing daily
trips, PLEASE keep the 6:28am CV and 6:49am CX options available
to align with commuter needs & regular Denver business hours.
There are 3 buses 5:00-5:46am that arrive too early into downtown

I am a regular commuter on the CX/CV/CS route. Please do not
make the changes that are proposed. The Federal Center stations
make it simpler to get to the Jeffco government center and also to
doctor’s appointments at St. Anthony. I’ve had to use the
connection between Aspen Park and Evergreen and also the return
trips during rush hour to take care of a sick child. The buses are
going up anyways- perhaps scheduling is the issue?With an eco
pass, RTD does offer some accommodations if you must return to
the PnR during the day, and I presume that would be utilized more
often if those routes were eliminated. It is likely more costly. Call
and Ride is not available in Conifer but could be an alternative. The
CX and EX routes are getting fuller every day, especially in winter.
The Federal Center stop is full in the afternoon and while some
riders would be able to use 100, the Conifer and Evergreen
commuters would not be able to do so. I hate to see route
elimination in rural areas. We are RTD taxpayers and pay a large
rate to access this service. The service is already limited - don’t
make it moreso.
As a resident of Conifer and daily RTD rider, I'm writing to express
my extreme displeasure at the proposal to eliminate the CS route
that stops at Federal Center. As it is, RTD makes it difficult to get
from Conifer to anywhere on the west side. If the CS is eliminated, it
will be outright impossible. During the school year, the final CS bus
of the morning is filled with students who get off at Federal Center,
I presume transferring to Red Rocks CC or other nearby campuses.
Proposing this change over the summer, when those students likely
aren't around to notice this sly change, is incredibly hostile to them
and demonstrates just how little care RTD has for taxpayers and
riders.
This is a short-sighted, rider-hostile proposal that will make traffic
worse and lead to less ridership. With Denver metro traffic getting
worse by the day, RTD ought to be investing in new routes that
make it easier for residents of mountain towns to commute into the
city. Instead, RTD is taking the opposite approach and trying to
eliminate service.
If RTD wants to increase express buses to downtown (a fine goal),
then it ought to replace the CS bus with a separate route that goes
between Conifer and either Federal Center or Jeffco Government
Center. Another solid option would be a short Conifer-Englewood
express down 285 that connects to the C/D light rail line.
I also recommend adding at least one later inbound bus leaving

Aspen Park around 7:40 am—not everyone needs to be downtown
by 8:30 am.
If RTD is still determined to eliminate the CS, at least wait to do it
during the school year, so the riders most affected by this change
have the opportunity to weigh in.

This note is in regard to the proposed change of the current
eastbound CV at 6:28 a.m. to 6:35 a.m. Kindly consider leaving this
time as close to the current schedule of 6:28 a.m. as possible.
Departing seven minutes later may not seem like much; however,
there is always a significant difference once schools are back in
session, winter storms are occurring, and our traffic congestion
continues to grow in leaps and bounds. In the summer, we
currently arrive at CCS around 7:30 a.m., which is lovely. Gives us
plenty of time to get to our offices by 8:00 a.m. In the winter, we
arrive CCS anywhere from 7:40 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., depending on
what’s happening on the roads. It makes us late for work, and a
later departure from Pine Junction will only exacerbate this problem
further. The proposed time wouldn’t be too bad in the summer, but
from September through May, it would only work if we all had jobs
across the street from the CCS. (I personally have to travel 17 blocks
on the mall shuttle to my office). Would you please consider
leaving the 6:28 a.m., as is?

I have 2 suggestions for
Eastbound: the 6:35 am will get us into Denver at 7:45 am. I have
to board the mall buses to get to work. With the increased traffic
and weather starting in the fall this could cause me to get to work
after 8am. I wish you would leave that route to 6:28 like it was.
Westbound: the 3:30 bus is way too early. That bus should service
riders that were on the CX (3:34) and CS (3:50). I would recommend
that if you want to "fill the bus" that you move it closer to 3:40 to
catch those riders who were catching those busses. That way the
2nd bus leaving at 4:15 would be only 1/2 hr later.
It doesn’t make sense to eliminate all service on these routes to
Federal Center as this is the closest connection to the light rail.
Riders will have to back-track from Civic Center Station to access
anything on the W line. I really hope that the persons making this
decision will reconsider the total elimination of Regional service to
the Federal Center.
I propose that two of the CV buses in each direction in the August
2018 schedule be authorized (by request only) to make quick
load/unload stops on the 6th Ave acceleration/deceleration ramps
at Union Blvd. These stops would be similar to the bus stops on the
SE corner of US285 and Wadsworth Blvd and elsewhere.
Passengers boarding at these stops could phone-ahead using the
My Ride system to request the bus to stop. Passengers unboarding
at these stops could simply ring the bell. This would be an minor
inconvenience to the through-passengers, and still meet the needs
of the public using the Federal Center PnR.
The low ridership on the CS Federal Center stop probably justifies
cancelling three routes in the morning and three in the evening (6
stops/day x approx. 250 days/yr is a major savings for RTD); but this
is a major regional PnR and there will always be a significant
number of passengers who will want to make connections.
Eliminating the Federal Center stop inconveniences many current
passengers.
I rode the CS from 1994 to 2016, and it was a major relief from the
carpooling, and frequent hitch-hiking I had to do prior to 1994.

This is extremely disappointing to eliminate any direct route from
Evergreen to the west side of the metro area. To get to the Fed
Center by bus, I would have to go downtown first and transfer to
get back. That increases the time by so much that it is not worth
doing.All this time, I have been waiting for the schedule from
Evergreen to the Fed Center to become more compatible with my
schedule so that I could ride more often. Instead, there will be no
incentive at all for me to take public transportation. Have you taken
any surveys of Evergreen area people to understand why
commuters to the west side of the metro area are not taking the
bus? Is it schedules (like my issue) or that it increases the commute
time by too much (which is also something I deal with). I am not
able to attend the public meeting on June 6, but I hope you will
realize that the attendance at the meeting may not be
representative of the people who are affected. There may be many
other people like me who do not ride now because the schedule is
inconvenient, and they may not be aware that there only option at
bus service to the west side is going away.
While on the bus last week, I heard that one of the proposed August
2018 service changes would affect the line that I ride. I take the CS
bus westbound from downtown Denver to the Federal Center at
7:15 AM several times per week and a return bus at 5:35 PM. I
would be downhearted if this bus route ceases.
I am paralyzed from the shoulders down and maneuver a power
wheelchair in my surroundings. I work for the National Park Service
in Lakewood and live a few blocks from my stop at 9th Avenue.
Since I cannot drive, in the warmer weather I take public transit to
work. This bus, at this time, is by far my best option, since taking
any other type of public transit would double my commute time to
and from the office. This includes Access-a-Ride, since taking that
may mean a 30 minute wait, other pickups and drop-offs, and the
duration of the ride distance. Although rider numbers are low
(generally 5-10), those that do regularly ride this route include not
only able-bodied folks but also myself and at least two others with
vision impairments. This bus route is essential to our independence.
Since having a disability almost always causes your personal
morning and evening care to be slow, efficient mobility to and from
work makes full-time employment possible.
Unfortunately, due to the long evenings required for me to get to
bed and the distance away from home, I'm unable to attend the
weekday evening public meetings to stress my need. I hope this
note presents a valid case for keeping the CS bus westbound
morning and eastbound evening shifts.

I wanted to provide feedback on the proposed discontinuation of
the CS and ES routes. These routes stopping at the Federal Center
Station provide an invaluable method for Conifer and Evergreen
riders to access Federal Center Station and all the businesses
adjacent to the Federal Center Station. Stopping at the Federal
Center Station also provides direct access to light rail with efficient
transfer to Jefferson County Government offices, Red Rocks
Community College, as well as destinations east of the Federal
Center Station.Discontinuing stops at Federal Center Station adds
approximately a minimum of one hour each way for Conifer and
Evergreen commuters to Denver Federal Center, Red Rocks
Community College, Jefferson County Government offices, and
businesses adjacent to Federal Center Station. The RTD proposal to
discontinue stopping at Federal Center Station is especially
inexplicable as existing routes from Conifer and Evergreen will drive
right by Federal Center Station though not stop. Would RTD
consider having some of the existing through routes from Conifer
and Evergreen stop at Federal Center Station? Having a few of the
existing routes from Conifer and Evergreen stop at Federal Center
Station would require no additional drivers or buses. At the
community meeting on 6/6/18, no through riders from Conifer or
Evergreen opposed the proposal to add stops at Federal Center
Station and in fact said they supported Federal Center Station stops
so that this needed coverage for Evergreen and Conifer
remained.Would it be possible to add Federal Center Station stops
to a few of the morning and a few of the evening existing routes
from Conifer and Evergreen? Through riders from Conifer and
Evergreen who did not want to have the additional 10 minutes
added to their commute (though there were no through riders at
the 6/6/18 community meeting who opposed adding Federal Center
Station stops) would still have the opportunity to take another bus
and Conifer and Evergreen riders needing access to Federal Center
Station would still have access to Federal Center Station without the
additional hour (or more) added to their commute. This would not
require additional buses or drivers by RTD.

I write to you to voice my concern for the changes proposed to the
CV/CX/CS schedule. My main concern is the CV leaving at 6:35am
from Pine Junction. I begin my work day at 8am. I normally ride the
6:28am bus from Pine Junction. I believe that even the proposed 7
minute delay of this route would create an enormous hardship to all
of our normal riders because There is not enough cushion time.
There are many times when that things happen along the way (i.e.
school is back in session, an accident, the weather or even more
times it is due to an inexperienced driver). These all create frequent
delays which cause this bus to arrive downtown very late and also
ensures that all riders are late for work or have missed their
connecting buses. This bus time is a popular one, which should
allow passengers to arrive to work by 8am (if the planet's are in
alignment). There have also been many times that our bus does not
even show up for various reasons. So, having these buses now
spread 45 minutes apart would be an enormous hardship and
absolutely make everyone late for work when we're forced to wait
45 minutes for the next bus. Unfortunately, it seems like these
mountain routes are not seen as a priority and we are left without
a driver. But I assure you, they are very important to the everyday
passengers that rely on it to get to work. I understand the thinking
behind eliminating the CS and CX and changing them all to CV; my
issue is the time changes. I believe the times need to be adjusted
more to allow for extra cushion time OR possibly a 6th bus instead
of only the proposed 5 busses each morning. Maybe adding
another bus in between the 6:10 &6:35 that would get into Civic
Center before 8am could be the solution. Thank you for taking the
time to read this email. Please contact me if you have any
questions or need any further information.
To whom it may concern,
I understand that one of the changes being considered for August
2018 is a discontinuation of the CS bus to Aspen Park. This causes
me great concern because my two sons, who are currently
attending Golden View Classical Academy, ride the W line and the
4:12 CS out of the Federal Center Park and Ride home most every
day. Without this Bus to Conifer things get considerable more
complicated with travel home from school. I am currently taking
the bus on a regular basis from Conifer to Civic Center Bus Station
to work downtown. Being I am riding the Bus from Conifer there is
no easy way to pick the boys up from school. I respectfully ask you
to reconsider the elimination of the CS route. Thank you.

Why would you change what is working and convenient for the
citizens up the 285 corridor? Traffic is already horrible on 285,
winters are generally worse than the city, the population continues
to grow up here just like in the city, and citizens riding the bus not
only is more convenient for some, but helps lessen traffic and
pollution. BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT! BETTER FOR THE
CITIZENS! Leave your greed on the table and continue to provide
existing service, or even consider improving it.

I take the CV bus from Pine Junction to Civic Center each business
day. I am extremely concerned about the time change for the
eastbound bus that now leaves PJ at 6:28 a.m. changing to 6:35 a.m.
This 7-minute difference would have a major impact on those of us
who rely on this bus to get us downtown in plenty of time for work.
For instance: I have to be at work at 16th and California promptly
at 8 a.m. With the current schedule this is not an issue, even if
there is heavier traffic and/or inclement weather. However, with
the 6:35 departure arriving at Civic Center at 7:45 this takes away
that cushion for unforeseen circumstances. My fellow riders and I
would truly appreciate you taking our concerns into consideration
and PLEASE keep the 6:28 a.m. PJ departure time the same!
I would like to share my thoughts regarding the proposed service
changes to the CV Route in August. I don't have any issue with
removing the CS and CX routes, although I will really miss the CX!
That's a long time to be on a bus, especially at the end of the day
and the express just makes it a little shorter.
I understand you are dealing with a shortage of drivers, so your
options may be limited. That said though, I would feel much safer
and generally would rather have more experienced drivers on our
route(s) than a series of new inexperienced drivers that get lost,
miss stops and/or get stuck or worse in the winter.
I had a chance to look over the proposed time changes to the CV
route. Most of them are okay with me. The only issue I have is with
the morning Eastbound CV route that currently leaves at 6:28am
being changed to 6:35am. I would prefer that that bus leave no
later than 6:30 so that we can reach our destinations on time,
particularly in the Winter when the buss tends to get to the Civic
Center late pretty regularly.

Eliminating service from Conifer to the Fed Center will make it
impossible for many people to use public transportation. Many
agencies love to take tax money from the foothills while refusing to
provide meaningful service. RTD service has always been marginal.
You are trying to make it useless. Many people would use the
service if it were practical. You need to add more routes, not fewer.
Remember, most of us don't work downtown. We don't want to go
there. Many of us work more than 8 hours. Your schedule makes it
problematic to get in 8 hours and impossible to work a longer shift.
More routes and extended hours would greatly increase riders.

+17203319300@tmomail.net

There are many people who rely on RTD for transportation from
Conifer to the Federal Center for the connections and the Evergreen
bus to Conifer. Traffic is getting worse and RTD should continue its
existing Conifer and Evergreen routes to allow people to get to work
in Denver who have no other options.

When I reviewed the May 20th proposed scheduled changes at:
http://www.rtd-denver.com/servicechanges-may2018.shtml
Nothing indicated any differences for the E line route. I had
downloaded the schedules to my phone and use it to determine
when routes cross and how best to make my train-to-bus
connections. After reviewing the schedule changes and not noticing
anything on the E line, I falsely believed it was staying the same as it
was. My first ride after the 20th of May resulted in a bit of
confusion and last Friday was even worse. The train I normally take
(and had been taking for over a year) suddenly was not there on the
normal schedule. (3:15 PM at Arapahoe Station) That train is now
at 3:08 PM. While this is a small change – it certainly is a change
that should have been mentioned. Many of us regular commuters
(my commute is three days a week) depend on the train and bus
schedule changes getting articulated *before* they change so we
can adjust our expectations. Missing connections and extending
our commutes, is not a welcome situation. Thank you for your
attention to this matter in the future.
Please do not eliminate the ES-Bus that provides service from the
Evergreen Park-n-Ride to the Denver Federal Center!

Please don’t discontinue ES service from Evergreen to the light rail
station at the Denver Federal Center!! Gas prices are going up! This
(and CS to Conifer) are the only service from the foothills to
anywhere and everywhere in Denver!
Perhaps fewer stops in Evergreen—limiting to to major Park and
Ride stops.
Perhaps stop doubling up ES and EX/EV at the same times on the
schedule.
Some route from Evergreen needs to stop at Federal Center station!

I am writing to express my concern about the proposed elimination
of the ES bus route. The effect of this change would be to eliminate
any public transportation option for entire Evergreen mountain
community to access the Federal Center, Red Rocks Community
College, St. Anthony’s Hospital, and the RTD light rail system. Many
Evergreen residents who work at the Lakewood Federal Center,
attend Red Rocks Community College, or access the RTD light rail
system from the Federal Center light rail station take the ES bus.By
limiting Evergreen bus service to the EV and EX Routes, Evergreen
residents who want to access the light rail system by public
transportation would be forced to take the EV or EX bus to Civic
Center Station and then backtrack to 16th and California, 16th and
Stout, or Union Station. In my experience riding the Evergreen
buses for the past 21 years, very few people would be willing to do
this, which would result in significant inconvenience for these
people and increase automobile traffic. This is inconsistent with
RTD’s fundamental mission.Eliminating the ES bus route also will
eliminate the Evergreen community’s option to take mass transit to
DIA. Without the ES bus, Evergreen residents will be forced to drive
to the Federal Center light rail station to access the W line to Union
Station or simply drive to DIA, which will both be a significant
inconvenience and increase traffic on I-70.In addition, with the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management considering moving its national
headquarters to Colorado, and possibly the Lakewood Federal
Center, eliminating the ES bus route is short-sighted at best. Please
reconsider this plan. It will be a significant detriment to the
Evergreen mountain community if it is implemented. Thank you for
the opportunity to provide these comments.

I would like to formally register my deep concern about a proposed
change to eliminate the 14:15 ES bus from the civic center to
Evergreen via the Federal Center.
I am a regular rider on the 14:15 ES as it is the ONLY mid day bus to
the mountains. I understand the AM and PM commuter schedule
and I use it everyday, but the 14:15 ES provides the only way to get
back up the hill before 5:00 PM. If someone has a Dr's
appointment or has to pick up a child from school or meet a service
provider, during the winter months - if people need to get home
before a storm, this is the bus they take - again it is the ONLY
midday bus, there is not an alternative bus. It is the 14:15 ES or
wait until the evening commute schedule.
As a regular rider I know a lot about who also depends on 14:15 ES.
During the school year - this mid day option picks up students at the
Fed Center from Red Rocks and other campuses - several are special
needs and as mentioned at the Evergreen public hearing - this is a
life line for them - if you eliminate it - how will they get home?
Waiting until the evening commute is not an option.
I know if is not a money maker and that there is a driver shortage,
but this is a community lifeline and the only mid-day option. I
would strongly request that you keep it the same - Please keep the
14:14 ES as it is.
Asking your consideration, please do not eliminate the ES bus from
Evergreen to Federal Center.
I have reviewed the proposed changes eliminating service between
Pine Junction and the federal center. If the goal of this change is to
reduce ridership you will likely have some success. The CV is not a
viable option for me. You would be taking me an extra 20 minutes
to downtown where I would have to wait for another bus or train
and then ride at least 30 back to the Federal Center. This would add
an hour or more to my travel times, making RTD an impractical
option. The Federal Center station is a major destination and there
are riders commuting to the Fed Center, hospital and Red Rocks
College. It seems more useful for riders to add a stop at this
location to the CV than to add extra 100L trips, as proposed. If some
consolidation is needed people can accept that, but eliminating
service to an important destination makes the system less usefull
and will increase the number of people driving into the city,
affecting traffic and air quality.
Please do not eliminate the ES-Bus that provides service from the
Evergreen Park-n-Ride to the Denver Federal Center. Thank you.

I am very concerned about your suggestion to eliminate the ES
route. I have been a faithful rider of the ES for the last NINTEEN
years, traveling from the Evergreen Park & Ride to the Denver
Federal Center. Please reconsider this proposed action.
Instead of offering the current three ES routes in the AM and the
five ES routes in the PM, please consider one to two in the AM and
two to three in the PM. Both actions will cut costs. Try these
changes for six months prior to making your proposed drastic
change. Moderately increasing the ES & CS fares to assist with
covering costs is an action I would support.
Please consider adding a Denver Federal Center stop to the EX or EV
routes.
I am not happy about contributing tax dollars to RTD and RTD
eliminating my way to work at the Denver Federal Center. Since
you are a quasi-governmental entity, please consider the needs of
the population your serve.
I attended the Evergreen Public Meeting this evening and heard
many carefully considered solutions from Evergreen and Conifer
residents who truly appreciate the ES & CS routes. I hope that you
will seriously consider these suggestions. During a time in our
country when many people do not believe the federal government
is listening to their concerns, it would be so refreshing to know that
RTD is listening to it's customers and is willing to implement some
of the suggestions.

After attending the proposed service changes meeting in Evergreen,
it is clear that RTD needs to maintain services between Evergreen
and Lakewood. ES (and CS) services connect the public
transportation network—light rail at Federal Center Station plus a
number of other local bus routes. ES (and CS) services are the only
mobility options for students and disabled individuals to connect to
schools and services in the western metro area. ES (and CS) services
are subsidized by a number of west metro area employers that
provide transportation subsidies for employees to buy passes and
ticket books on a monthly basis. Because of the way the subsidies
work, more tickets are bought than used. So, rider counts on these
routes under represent the revenue from the subsidized ticket
sales. RTD goals need to be to provide public transportation and to
link to the public network. Suggest that ES-EV-EX routes need to be
recombined to result in or no loss of service times or service
locations but fewer total trips.After attending the proposed service

Good morning I reviewed the subsidy handout from the meeting in
Evergreen over the weekend. I may be reading it wrong, but the
$40 subsidy discussed in the meeting appears to be for the Green
bus, not the ES/EV/EX route. Could you please let me know if I am
reading this wrong and also forward me the subsidy statistics for
2017?

I am writing to object to the proposed changes that will eliminate
the Federal Center stop from the ES and CS routes. The proposed
changes seem to be paving the way for elimination of those routes
altogether.
On many days, most of the riders on these routes travel between
the Federal Center and the Civic Center Station. When the Federal
Center is cut out, the routes will have far fewer riders per bus. RTD
may then determine that ridership does not support such routes
and cancel the Conifer and Evergreen express routes in the next
round of cuts.
Disabled riders use the ES and CS to travel from Evergreen or
Conifer to the Federal Center. When the Federal Center stop is
eliminated, disabled riders will lose their best option to reach the
Federal Center and connect with light rail or other routes.
Please reconsider eliminating the Federal Center stop on the ES and
CS routes.
I commented last night but would like for you to consider the
traffics issue on I70 in your proposal as well as the times you have
picked. I am an ev/ex rider. I only take the ev because of the times it
is offered and prefer the ex. That being said I think that getting rid
of the Es bus is not the best idea. What about having a bus 2 time a
day that Judy goes to the federal center and people can then
transfer to the 100L or the train. First of all have you taken the w? It
is the slowest train.. eliminate some of those super small stops and
maybe the train will be a more viable option.. also if the junction
was in place the train would be able to take people to the tech
center.Also the bus times right only allows people from evergreen
to go directly to Work and back.. and leaves no additional time for
folks to run errands or enjoy Denver or stay late. Having an express
bus remain at 645 or even later would be ideal..many of us know it
is an option and are only way home if needed.I would also say that
increasing bus service would improve ridership. I feel that the group
was right advertise. We have a ton of young people who may use
the bus to get into town if they knew it was available.
While riding the EX this morning, I read a few articles on recent
trends in privatizing public transportation. I appreciate the public
hearing yesterday and in the spirit of creative solutions. Perhaps
there is an opportunity to work with private entities to address the
community concerns expressed last night and also to better use
taxpayer money. For example, f the subsidy per ride is $40 it would
be cheaper for us to take Uber.

I am a commuter on the FF1 at 5:15 its seems once the 0 changed
time we have a hardtime getting the connection to the 0. We have
passengers either having to take the free shuttle and walk as close
as they can to work or walk.
Do to the recent complaint and Im sure others have responded
below is the email I sent on June 5th ,2018. Below is the email I
sent. before schedule was changed I was getting to work on time
now Im having to make up lost time from work. plus we have now a
rude driver that will see you and takes off.
I just wanted to voice how displeased as I am with the schedule
changes that took place on May 20th; all of the buses that I
normally take for my commute have been reduced, either from
every 15 min to every 30 min or from every 30 min to every hour.
This literally adds hours to my commute every single day because
the connections I used to make no longer match up with each other.
I bought an annual pass and now I feel cheated because the service
is so inconvenient that it isn't worth it; it shouldn't take two hours
to go from Louisville to Boulder when it takes ten minutes in a car!
You can bet I won't be buying another pass next year!
I am writing to voice my opinion on the proposed changes to the
Stampede route and the elimination of service to Marine Street.
You are wrong in wanting to remove service from this part of the CU
Boulder campus. Many employees rely on this service to and from
main campus to get to meetings, classes or other events. We only
have to take one bus to campus. Taking two buses is a bigger
inconvenience and requires us to leave our jobs earlier.I hereby
object to the proposed change.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

GM Oversight & Performance Management
Committee

Date: June 20, 2018

From:

Barbara G McManus,

GM

Date:

June 20, 2018

Subject:

Approval of General Manager's 2019 Goals

Executive

Manager,

Board Meeting Date: June 26, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2019 as amended in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and Staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals utilizing the RTD
employee performance evaluation form consistent to all salaried RTD employees. This action item is to
formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2019 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the June 18, 2018 committee meeting to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2019 and the five task goals for 2019. The General Manager Tactical Plan for 2019 is
submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2019 Goals.

Packet Pg. 248

12.D

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2019 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2019 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear, documented and timely process.

Proposed Core and Task Goals for 2019

As discussed at the April 24, 2018 General Manager and CEO Oversight and Performance
Management Committee meeting, this memo presents the proposed 2019 GM core and task goals
in a memo, bullet point format. For each core and task goal, the overall goal is listed followed
by the criteria for needs improvement, achieved goal, and exceeded expectations. The task goals
are based on the five strategic priorities from the 2018 Board/Senior Leadership Team retreat in
March 2018 and the subsequent 2019 tactical plan. This is an increase in the number of task
goals from three to five, or a 66% increase. Subsequent to the May 17, 2018 GM Oversight and
Performance Management Committee meeting, this memo contains revisions based on that
discussion.

2018 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $24.8 million from the 2018 Adopted Budget to $700.4 million. This increment consists of
an increase of $24.5 million on the Base System, a decrease of $2.4 million in FasTracks
Project/Construction, and an increase of $2.7 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $24.5 million increase for the Base System, major elements are $4.1 million for a budget
adjustment from $1.80/gallon to $2.20/gallon for diesel fuel; $1.4 million in bus operations trainee
wages and fringes not included in the adopted budget; $4.9 million in cost increases for fixed route
contractors; a transfer of $0.7 million from the Elati division overhead door project to fund the Platte
division overhead door project; $0.5 million increase in facilities maintenance overtime; net $0.5 million
in total in additional funds for various facilities maintenance projects either not fully funded or not carried
forward from 2017; $0.2 million in additional funds for ISO certification in Asset Management; $0.2
million for cellular data capture for live video on buses; $0.2 million for overtime for security staff; $0.5
million for increase to worker’s comp insurance; $.0.3 million for contracted maintenance on VMWare;
$2.7 million for development changes related for fare structure changes; $0.2 million for SmartCard
spare parts; $0.4 million in increase to Mobile Ticketing fees; $0.8 million to replenish the $5.0 million
contingency fund; and previously approved transfers.
For FasTracks Project, the $2.4 million decrease consists primarily of a $7.0 million reduction to the
SERE betterments budget; offset by a $4.0 million increase to the North Metro betterments budget; $0.2
million in consultant work for TIES due to North Metro expansion; and other miscellaneous items. For
FasTracks Operations, the $2.7 million increase consists mainly of $0.2 million in costs for commuter
rail VMS takeover; and previously approved transfers.
Major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses are summarized by department below (summary
excludes previously approved transfers and expense projects carry-forward unless noted), shown in
detail on the attached Amendment A.

Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget. Debt
principal payments also will not change. This is due to the absence of debt refundings/issuances since
the Adopted Budget. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change. On FasTracks, interest
expense is budgeted to remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not
change. Capitalized interest is expected to remain the same. No new financing will be issued during the
remainder of 2018 for either Base System or FasTracks.
2018 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $188.4 million, consisting of $59.4
million for Base System and $129.0 million for FasTracks. The net increase over the 2018 Adopted
Budget new capital is $0.595 million. These changes result from program changes that have occurred
since the 2018 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System

Packet Pg. 274

12.E

Total new capital is $59.4 million for the Base System. New capital changes for Base System result in a
net increase of $0.5 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. Adjustments to new capital
funding from the 2018 Adopted Budget include additional funding of $0.2 million via budget transfers
for projects including Secure Storage Containers, Support/Service Vehicles, and CCTV Retrofit on LRV.
Projects receiving new funding totaling $0.3 million are Laptop Computers for Vehicle Maintenance and
design work for the Mezzanine Addition for Operator Training at Elati. Please see Attachment B for
detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
Total new capital is $129.0 million for FasTracks (Project). New capital changes for FasTracks result in
a net increase of $0.092 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. This results from updated
project schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2018, adjustments for
grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget. Changes to new
capital funding from the 2018 Adopted Budget include $1.0 million in additional expenses for the East
Line and Southeast Rail Extension, offset by reductions in spending of $0.9 million to FasTracks Admin
Projects and the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program
Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2018 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/17 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2018 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/17 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2017.
Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $639.7 million, a decrease of $103.8 million from
the 2018 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2017 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved transfers,
project scope changes, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward amount, the Base System
portion is $81.0 million and the FasTracks portion is $558.7 million. Major capital carryforward projects
are 16th Street Mall Paver Repair, expansion of the Customer Care Telephone Center, East Corridor closeout, and North Metro rail construction. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital
attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $0.6 million on a combined basis from the
2018 Adopted Budget.


Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $3.3 million from the 2018 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March 2018 forecast. The 2018 Amended Budget
incorporates the baseline forecast of 4.1% over 2017 actual sales/use tax revenue. The 2018

Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds September Baseline forecast which called for a 4.9%
increase over the then projected 2017 level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to decline $0.6 million
from amounts in the 2018 Adopted Budget. On the Base System, grant revenue is projected to
decrease $4.2 million in CC&D and FTA funds for the Colfax Avenue planning study, WIN
program funding, CMAQ funding, and Homeland Security grants, offset by increases in capital
maintenance, SOGR, and FASTER grants. For FasTracks, grants are budgeted to increase $3.6
million due to higher carryforward for various grants. Contributed capital (not shown in the table
above) is projected to increase $2.3 million from third-party betterments and project
contributions.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to remain unchanged in the 2018 Amended Budget for both Base
System and FasTracks. We will revise our estimates in the 2019 budget based on more months
of actual data. Of projected fare revenue of $146.8 million, $115.2 million is attributed to the
Base System and $31.6 million is attributed to FasTracks (Operations). Fare revenue is
forecasted on the basis of a fare revenue model being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue
between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors, and which takes into
account ridership decline. Using this model, in 2018 a higher proportionate amount of fare
revenue was allocated to Base System and a lower amount was allocated to FasTracks than in
previous periods in which FasTracks fare revenue had been overestimated.
Other operating revenue will remain flat from the 2018 Adopted Budget.
Investment income is budgeted to be $4.4 million higher based on forecasts of rising interest
rates, with $0.5 million of this increase in the Base System and $3.9 million in FasTracks.

Although the primary sources of revenue are budgeted to remain flat, other sources of funding are
anticipated to materialize or have done so to support the budgeted increase in operating expense. These
include: 1) third-party funding, 2) increase to the unrestricted fund balance at year-end 2017 which
becomes the beginning fund balance for 2018, 3) release of unspent funds from closure of capital
projects, and 4) deferral of certain projects scheduled for 2018 to 2019. Capital expenditures (on-going
and carry-forward) in 2018 will be funded by previously issued debt proceeds and previously identified
project funding.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $3.2 million from the
Adopted Budget to $47.5 million reflecting the funding sources described above, net of amended budget
revisions to both revenue and expenses, replenishment of Board-Appropriated fund, and increases to
reserves per fund balance policy.
FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $15.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
is used to fund any changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption

Packet Pg. 276

12.E

of the annual budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor
changes to the FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from
the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account is budgeted at $71.5
million. These project reserve balances remain unchanged from the 2018 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2018 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2018 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.

Packet Pg. 277

12.E

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2018
Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $28.6 million to $1,329.0 million as detailed
above in the Discussion section overview of the 2018 Amended Budget, and to decrease the
appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $103.8 million to
$639.7 million.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2018 Adopted Budget and amend the
budget with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2018 Adopted Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2018 Adopted
Budget does not reflect the necessary capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments,
and material changes to the operating and administrative budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Barbara McManus

Date: June 21, 2018

From:

John McKay, Adminstrator

GM

Date:

June 21, 2018

Board Meeting Date: June 26, 2018

Subject:

Ratify and Reaffirm the Execution of a Contract
with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Executive Committee presents to the Board of Directors a motion to ratify and reaffirm the General
Manager’s execution of a contract for state legislative liaison/lobbyist services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) that has been executed pursuant to and consistent with
the General Manager’s contract and with the delegations of authority previously issued by the Board
regarding the General Manager’s contracting authority.
This recommended action is consistent with General Manager’s Core Goal #5 - Effective
Communications & Community Outreach.
BACKGROUND
On June 5, 2018, the General Manager executed a contract for state legislative liaison services with
BBMK. Though staff had presented contracts for liaison services to the Board in the past, due to the
amount of the contracted services here, the General Manager was authorized under his contracting
authority to execute the contract.
DISCUSSION
Members of the Executive Committee discussed the issue of whether or not the execution of contracts
for liaison services should be presented to the Board as a whole, even in cases where the amount of the
contracts would be within the General Manager’s contracting authority as expressly authorized by the
Board in prior resolutions. The specific question presented here is limited to whether this particular
contract should be ratified and reaffirmed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact for this approval.
ALTERNATIVES
1. That the Board of Directors ratify and reaffirm the General Manager’s execution of a contract for
state legislative liaison services with BBMK that was executed pursuant to and consistent with
the General Manager’s contract and with the delegations of authority previously issued by the
Board regarding the General Manager’s contracting authority.
2. That the Board not ratify and reaffirm the contract execution.
