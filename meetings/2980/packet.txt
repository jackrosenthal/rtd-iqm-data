January 1, 2019 Valuation Highlights

Plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008.
Market value return, net of investment expenses, was -5.1% during the 2018 Plan Year.
The recommended contribution is for the following fiscal year (i.e., 1/1/2018 calculation is for the 2019 Fiscal Year)

1.C.1.a

 There has been no change in the Board’s funding policy since 2016 – the contribution
continues to be determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based
on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer

 Last year, based on January 1, 2018 actuarial valuation results and an estimated
2018 net investment return of -5.2%, the Plan was not projected to reach 100%
funding with a $5.6M contribution each year, if all assumptions were met in the future,
including a net investment return of 7.0% per year beginning in 2019

 The Plan was projected to achieve 100% funding (in 2031) only if the recommended
contribution was contributed beginning in 2020

 What changed since last year?
 The actual net investment return for 2018 was -5.1% based on the 12/31/2018 Plan audit
 The Plan experienced an asset loss of $3.0M and a liability gain of $2.4M during 2018
 The operating expense assumption was increased from $135,000 to $140,000 per year,
payable monthly, with a 2% annual increase thereafter

 A contribution of $5.1M was made in 2019 instead of $5.6M

Long-Term Funding

1.C.1.a

 Reflecting January 1, 2019 valuation results, the Plan is not projected to reach 100%
funding with a $5.1M contribution each year if all actuarial assumptions are met in the
future, including a net investment return of 7.0% per year beginning in 2019

 What happened since the final January 1, 2019 valuation results were issued?
 The Board approved a $6.1M contribution for the 2020 Fiscal Year; the actuary’s
recommended contribution was $8.1M

 The investment return in 2019 was greater than the 7.0% assumption – the preliminary 2019
return is 16.5%, net of investment expenses, based on the December 31, 2019 unaudited
financial statements

Long-Term Funding (Continued)

1.C.1.a

 Reflecting January 1, 2019 valuation results, a $6.1M contribution in 2020, a
16.5% preliminary net return on assets in 2019, and assuming all actuarial
assumptions are realized, including a 7.0% net investment return per year beginning
in 2020:

 If future contributions are equal to $6.1M, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in
2034 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $6.1M in 2034
 The recommended contribution ranges from $8.3M in 2021 up to $19.0M in 2031 and
decreases sharply thereafter

 If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2021, the Plan is expected to achieve
100% funding in 2031 (end of the 12-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $6.1M in 2028
 The recommended contribution decreases from $8.3M in 2021 down to $4.5M in 2031

 Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant impact
on projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s
investment performance on future costs

INFORMATION
The 2020 Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer early, substantive
input into the development of the RTD Annual Budget and financial plans.
BACKGROUND
The purpose of the attached calendar is to assist Board members in anticipating and planning their input
into the development of specifically the 2020 Amended Budget, 2021-2026 Mid-Term Financial Plan
(both Base System and FasTracks), the Financial Plan (to 2050), and 2021 Budget. The GM’s strategic
goals developed by the Board at the March 7 Board Advance will be incorporated into the 2021 Budget
plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the Board to
develop an understanding of and provide guidance in:
(1) 2020 Amended Budget
(2) Determining the objectives and priorities of the 2021 Budget
(3) Defining the key cost elements in the annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for RTD to
satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring
The suggested topics and timing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of keeping
the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the Board to
develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the Board in moving
ahead with this plan.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

March 3, 2020

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: March 4, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: March 10, 2020

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
In the first six months of the program (August 2019 - January 2020), 3,550 participants enrolled.
During this timeframe, 1,410 individuals purchased passes on their mobile device (3-hour passes and
day passes), while 330 chose MyRide cards. Nonprofit organizations purchased approximately 78,000
LiVE tickets. The majority of the LiVE ticket sales to nonprofits occurred in January 2020 since the
nonprofit program did not transition to the LiVE program rules until the end of 2019.
As of February 24, 2020, 6,829 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 4,294 have been
approved, 1,734 have been denied and the remaining 801 are pending. Of the 1,734 denied, 1,190
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 385 were denied because their address was out of District, 28 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 14 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 7 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 110 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold. Of the 801 pending applications, 729 lack an uploaded photo, 59 are
pending for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for
LiVE, one is pending for income verification by Denver Human Services, and 12 applications are pending
because the applicant needs to provide additional information.
Between February 25 and March 2, 2020, 284 new participants enrolled. Note that we have seen a
significant increase in the number of enrollments per week over the last three months (with the
exception of holiday weeks).
