FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: JULY 14, 2015



Surface transportation programs are currently operating under a two-month policy extension that
expires on July 31.



Long-term revenue solution: Even after several hearings on the subject of transportation funding
and finance over the past month, the House and Senate tax-writing committees have not yet been
able to reach consensus on a multi-year revenue solution. Vocal opposition persists, among various
factions in Congress, to the two most often-discussed ideas: increasing the gas tax and taxing the
overseas assets of U.S. corporations (repatriation tax). As the funding impasse continues, most of
the surface transportation authorizing (i.e., policy-making) committees of the House and Senate have
refrained from moving multi-year legislation.



Short-term revenue solution: Accordingly, there is broad resignation among stakeholders that
Congress will pass another short-term extension of surface transportation programs before the July
31 deadline. Any bill would likely extend funding at current-year levels, paid for by another General
Fund transfer to the HTF. The only real question is the duration of the extension.

FY 2016 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:


The Senate Appropriations Committee on June 24 approved a spending bill to fund the programs of
US DOT for the fiscal year beginning on October 1. In the absence of an authorization bill for FY
2016, the Senate bill maintains current-year funding levels for transit formula programs funded from
the HTF, but makes cuts from current-year levels for several General Fund programs, including the
Capital Investment Grants (“New Starts”) program. (The full House passed its own THUD bill in
early June.)



Committee Democrats objected to the funding levels in bill, urging their Republican counterparts to
fund programs at levels that would require the Committee to exceed the sequester-imposed funding
levels for this year, in violation of this year’s budget agreement. The White House and Congressional
Democrats continue to insist that sequester cuts cannot be accepted, but Republicans in both the
House and Senate are drafting all spending bills to fit within FY 2016 sequester levels.



So what’s next? Congress must act by the end of September to pass the 12 annual appropriations
bills that keep government programs and agencies funded. It is likely lawmakers will pass a shortterm omnibus spending bill in late September that maintains current funding levels for Federal
programs and buys Appropriators more time to work out a bipartisan budget deal on full-year
spending levels.
