### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Roger Sherman, from CRL Associates, acknowledged that the last time the committee met was the night of the Denver Municipal Runoff Elections.  The election resulted in seven (7) new council seats, including Kevin Flynn, who at the time served as RTD’s Public Information Manager for the Eagle P3 project.  Roger Sherman noted that density, congestion, and how transit fits into these two issues will be some of the items that will be taken up by the Denver City Council.

Roger Sherman mentioned that the candidate deadlines for the November municipal elections have various dates through the end of August.  Once those submissions are official he will prepare a snapshot of the candidates and distribute it to the Board.

He noted that Wheat Ridge will include a ballot measure looking to limit the Urban Renewal Authority and City Council in approving Tax Increment Financing over $2.5 million.

Director Francone asked about the possible annexation of Southwest Plaza to Bow Mar.  Roger Sherman replied that he has not heard anything further since the developer suspended the efforts in late April.  He said he would do some research to see if there has been any progress.

#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Megan Wagner, Director of Client Services for Brandeberry~McKenna, noted that both Jenifer Brandeberry and Julie McKenna were on vacation.

Megan Wagner thanked the Directors who attended the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) meeting.  She acknowledged that the committee asked very tough questions yet the answers provided by David Genova, Interim General Manager, and Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen were great.  She also thanked the Directors who have confirmed their attendance to the Council of State Governments West Conference Meeting: Transportation Presentation on July 27th.  Committee Chair Folska confirmed her attendance for this event.

##### a. State Update for 7-14-15

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Committee Chair Folska noted that Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs was not in attendance due to a scheduling conflict.  She referred the Directors to the Federal Update included in the Government Relations Committee Agenda packet for July 14, 2015.  The update included information on the MAP-21 and Highway Trust Fund (HTF) long and short term solutions as well as Fiscal Year 2016 Transportation/Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill.

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, indicated that the House of Representatives just introduced another MAP-21 bill that would provide short term reauthorization.  She noted that the Senate is against any short term extension as they would like to see a six year bill.  Sherry Ellebracht said it would be magical how they would come up with a long term funding solution, making a short term funding more likely.  She added that the House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan is trying to buy some time to come up with some tax reform.  The bill should be on the floor tomorrow.

Committee Chair Folska stated that Congress does not have a collision of courage to pass something like a gas tax to fund the HTF.  She shared a couple of conversations she recently had: one with a Transportation Planner professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another with a Transportation Planner professor at the University of California at Berkley.  She noted that both professors thought that a percentage and not a regular tax would be more beneficial in funding the HTF.  She suggested this may be something for Squire Patton Boggs to think about and evaluate.

##### a. Fed Update 7 14 15

### D. Other Matters

Director Francone encouraged the Directors to actively search for opportunities to talk to the State Legislators from their District and educate them on what RTD does.  She mentioned that it was clear from the questions during the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) that a lot of the legislators do not know what RTD does and how the agency interconnects with the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Denver Regional Council of Governments.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Folska adjourned the meeting at 9:30 p.m.
