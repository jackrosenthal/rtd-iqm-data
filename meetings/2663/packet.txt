BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: April 26, 2017

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant

Subject:

Additional Funding for Triunity-Hill Joint
Venture Contract for FasTracks Construction
Management Support Consultant Services

General

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Triunity -Hill Joint
Venture for Construction Management Support Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks,
increasing the Not-to-Exceed contract value through July 14, 2020 by $19,250,000. Funding for
this award is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2020 in the specific projects
where CMSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future
year capital budgets.
BACKGROUND
In April 2014, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to the TriunityHill Joint Venture for an amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services. Notice to Proceed was issued on July 15, 2014, for a six-year contract with
four one-year options. This contract amendment would increase the total contract not-to-exceed
value through the contract end date of July 14, 2020 to $34,400,000.
As of April 21, 2017, RTD has contracted for a total of $13,405,863 in services to be delivered through
December 31, 2017, and is in the process of negotiating change orders for an additional $948,028,
which would bring the actual contract amount to $14,353,891. As of the February 2017 invoice, RTD
has paid out a total of $7,858,674 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill JV includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE goal of
27% for this contract. As of the February 2017 invoice, actual DBE participation has been 49.64% .
DISCUSSION
The CMSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control
of the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The CMSC provides key personnel to
support the program in specialized disciplines and short-term roles, generally meeting one or more of
the following criteria:





Technical knowledge or experience that RTD does not have in-house
Functions for which RTD cannot hire staff within its salary structure
Roles lasting less than a year
Functions that require less than a full-time equivalent employee

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The detailed scope of work for the CMSC contract is negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s
work tasks. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to ensure that specific tasks
and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program. The initial funding for the
contract covered the tasks and deliverables needed through the end of 2017. The requested
additional funding is expected to cover the tasks and deliverables needed through July 14, 2020. If
RTD needs additional services past the current contract end date, future Board action will be needed
to exercise the contract options and increase the contract not-to-exceed amount.
To date, the CMSC has provided the following support for the FasTracks program, and will continue
providing this support through the end of 2017:









Construction support for North Metro and Southeast Rail Extension
DBE support
Project controls support
Specialized planning and environmental support
TOD support
Specialized engineering support
Quality management support
Selected closeout staffing roles on the Eagle and I-225 corridors

RTD envisions the CMSC providing continuing support in those areas through 2020, as well as
additional support in the following areas:
 Closeout support for North Metro and Southeast Rail Extension
 Preparation of federally-required before and after studies for the Eagle and Southeast Rail
Extension projects
 Preparation of the annual Quality of Life report
The specific work scope for each future year would be established late in the prior year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the CMSC contract from would be $34,400,000 w ith
this amendment. These funds would be utilized upon inclusion in a specific future work program.
Funding for the future work program is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 20182020 in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in future year capital budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, increasing the Not-to-Exceed contract value through
July 14, 2020 by $19,250,000. Funding for this award is included in the 2016 Annual Program
Evaluation for 2018-2020 in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized, and
will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to increase the
contract not-to-exceed value. Instead, terminate the contract and perform all the work in-house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff capacity to fill the roles
anticipated to be filled by CMSC personnel.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to increase the
contract not-to-exceed value. Instead, terminate the contract and re-solicit this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended as the CMSC is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD
team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Subject:

Approval of increased Contract Authorization
to Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC)
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

General

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
increase the board authorized contract amount with Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the
amount of $3,173,202. This will result in a total contract not-to-exceed authorization of $67,482,759
and will provide funding through the remainder of 2017. Funds for the contract authorization are
included in the specific project budgets where FRSC support would be utilized.
It is further recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the
contract completion date from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and increase the total
contract amount by $3,500,000, for a total contract authorization of $70,982,759. Funding for this
scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 in the specific projects where FRSC
support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018 capital budget.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2011.
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:










Provided construction management support for the West Rail Line Project

1.B.2




Provided engineering review and inspection services of the Eagle P3 commuter rail vehicles
Provided engineering advising services in regard to the commuter rail vehicle equalizer beam
warranty issue

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach will save the RTD cost and will facilitate the
operation and maintenance of the system. The initial contract award was for the final design services
for the West Corridor and evaluation of commuter rail vehicle type. The work effort is consistent with
the work required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule.
In particular, FRSC will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing; the Southeast Rail Line
Extension, the I-225 Rail Line, the North Metro Rail Line, the US36 BRT line and the Eagle Project. The
proposed Scope of Work to be performed under the increased Contract Authorization is as follows:


Program Management & Support Services
o Provide CADD and Quality Assurance services as required by RTD

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2



Southeast Rail Extension Project
o Review submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
o Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering
o Assist RTD in reviewing the SERE Systems schedule
o Perform field inspections
o Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program
o Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes

RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to retain
the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet the final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. Other projects will be completing construction and entering systems integrated
testing in 2018 The proposed time extension to the FRSC contract would make the resources available
to RTD to complete construction, systems integrated testing, and project closeout in a timely and costeffective manner.
The contract extension through 2018 will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with
projected timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual were to leave the
FRSC team before the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all
remaining hours for that individual. Any future consultant support outside of these designated areas will
be procured through the Systems Engineering Consultant contract to be awarded later in 2017, and will
not be added to the scope of this contract.
Specific projects where FRSC assistance is anticipated in 2018 include:
o Eagle P3 Commuter Rail
o North Metro Rail Line
o Southeast Rail Extension
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 17.5% DBE goal. Front
Range Systems Consultants has proposed a 13% DBE goal for the 2017 work, exceeding the RTD
proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized. Funding for
2018 scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 in the specific projects where
FRSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018 capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors increase the board authorized contract amount with Front
Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the amount of $3,173,202. This will result in a total contract
authorization of $67,482,759 and will provide funding through the remainder of 2017. Funds for the
contract authorization are included in the specific project budgets where FRSC support would be
utilized.
It is further recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and increase
the not-to-exceed contract amount by $3,500,000, for a total contract not-to-exceed authorization
of $70,982,759. Funding for this scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018
in the specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018
capital budget.
Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach. This is not
recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized staff to meet the System Engineering
needs of the FasTracks Program. Selection of alternative two could delay implementation of the
FasTracks Program.

GM

Date:

Subject:

Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

General

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date
from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019. Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is
included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized, and
will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital bud gets.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board has
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that have brought the current
Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to $191,423,336. This contract amendment would not increase the
contract value beyond the current authorized amount.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six -year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The current end date of the
contract is June 30, 2017.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to
retain the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts, meet final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects, and finalize the transactions and mapping that will secure the right -of-way
for the program alignments, including survey and mapping support for final acquisiti ons and utility
relocations, post-construction surveys, and filing of right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension
to the Jacobs contract would make the resources available to RTD to complete the project closeout
in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.3

In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD could face potential claims or lawsuits
related to its projects. Support from the PSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be
critical to resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual were to leave Jacobs
before the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining
hours for that individual. Any future consultant support outside of these designated areas will be
procured through the Construction Management Support Consultant contract with Triunity -Hill, and
will not be added to the scope of this contract.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide track engineering support through the end of 2017.
 Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW),
and utility survey for all corridors and facilities.
North Metro
 Provide a full time Contract Manager through the first quarter of 2018.
 Provide environmental support through the first quarter of 2018.
 Provide construction support through the first quarter of 2018.
 Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
I-225
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
 Provide construction support through project closeout.
SEC Ext.
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
 Provide environmental support through the end of 2017.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
 Provide P3 and railroad support through project closeout
 Provide Federal Agency Liaison and Risk Manager through project closeout.
 Provide full time Project Controls Manager and Contract Manager through project closeout.
 Provide FEIS/ROD mitigation monitoring through project closeout.
 Provide a part-time System Safety Manager through the end of 2017.
 Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support.
 Provide construction oversight through project closeout.
West Rail
 Provide support to close remaining right-of-way issues.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 20.07%. RTD does not foresee any additional opportunities
for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the named roles are filled by
Jacobs employees. All of the DBE subcontractors with continuing roles on the FasTracks program also
participate in the Triunity-Hill contract. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed amount,
the DBE participation on the overall contract would be 18.72%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2019, would
remain at the currently authorized amount of $191,423,336 with this amendment. Funding for
project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks

capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for future
year scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects
where PSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year
capital budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services for
FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019.
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for
the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 -2019
in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in future year capital budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to extend the
contract completion date for Jacobs Engineering. This is not recommended because of the
institutional knowledge and background of the specific staff to be retained through this
amendment. As RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient level of expertise in a cost effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in the Background section,
the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed basis).

Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2017 through
June 29, 2018) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of $127,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 4 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has an excellent record of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2017 through June 29, 2018) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$127,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action.
Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for
Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

Re:

May Board Update

On April 28th, the Legislative Council Committee will consider several requests for Interim
Committees on various subjects. Speaker Duran and Rep. Pabon requested that an interim study
committee be formed to study approaches to address and mitigate the impacts of large
transportation projects. BBMK has included a copy of this interim study.
HB17-1348 Prohibit HOV High Occupancy Vehicle 3 Requirements North I -25 sponsored
by Senator Scott and Rep. Lebsock. The bill specifies that after July 1, 2018 the use of the North
I-25 express lane that is managed by HPTE or a P3 partner is free for any motor vehicle that is
occupied by two or more individuals including the driver. The bill was introduced and assigned
to the House Transportation and Energy Committee. The House co-sponsors include Reps.
Gray, McKean and Pabon.
HB17-1242 New Transportation Infrastructure Funding Revenue sponsored by Speaker
Duran, Senate President Grantham and Transportation Chairs Rep. Mitsch Bush and Senator
Baumgardner. The bill requires a ballot question to be submitted to the voters of the state at the
November 2017 statewide election, that seeks approval for the state to temporarily increase the
rate of the state sales and use tax for 20 years, beginning in 2018. If the voters approve the
temporary sales and use tax rate increase, the new revenue generated is allocated solely for
transportation infrastructure funding purposes. Specific projects to be funded will be required to
be included in the 2017 ballot information booklet, provided to the voters of the state.
The bill passed the Senate Transportation Committee with significant amendments to the
allocation formula. The following amendments were adopted in the Senate Transportation
Committee:
L122: Change in formula
L125: Increases the maximum repayment amount for TRANs from $5 billion to $5.5
billion.
L127: Additions to ballot language
L126: CDOT development list/ Bluebook 30 to 45 days
L.128: Removes transit affordability language added to the bill in the House through
amendments L.060 and L.065 from the bill.
L129: Eliminates the multimodal transportation options committee and assigns its duties
relating to the allocation of money from the transportation options account of the
multimodal transportation options fund to CDOT's transit and rail advisory
committee and adds advocates for affordable transportation options, persons with

disabilities, and bicyclists and pedestrians to the advisory committee
L131: $50 million CDOT buy in for bond payment
L132: $100 million general fund for CDOT bond payments
L133: Reduce sales tax to half cent
L134: Additions to transportation options committee
L135: Website (Lawrence amendment request)
L136: Contractor prequalification (Lawrence amendment request)
L137: Best value (Lawrence amendment request)
The bill is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee on April 25th at 2pm.
SB17-153 Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission sponsored by
Senators Garcia and Crowder and Rep. Esgar. The bill replaces the Southwest Chief Rail Line
Commission housed in CDOT with the Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail
Commission. The new commission will assume the duties of the old commission which was set
to repeal on July 1, 2017. These duties include the coordination of efforts to ensure that track
repairs and upgrades required for continuation of the existing Southwest Chief Rail service in
Colorado are completed. The bill will also study extending rail service to Pueblo as well as
exploring the benefits of extending service to Walsenberg. The Commission is also tasked with
developing draft legislation that facilitates the development of a passenger rail system to provide
service in and along the I-25 corridor. An appointee from the District would be a member of
the Board. CDOT is supporting the bill and the legislation provides an opportunity to have all
stakeholders involved in this discussion at the table. The bill has passed the House and
Senate.
SB17-040 Public Access to Government Files sponsored by Senators Kefalas and Gardner and
Rep. Pabon. The bill concerns public access to digital database records. The bill passed the
Senate with an amendment requiring the judicial division to be subject to the Colorado Open
Records Act. Additional amendments were added on Second Reading that provide exemptions
to CORA for infrastructure as well as information allowing public employees to request
certain information be protected from disclosure. The bill was heard in the House Finance
Committee on Tuesday. The Senate amendments were removed from the bill and the bill
passed on a party line vote. Rep. Pabon has committed to work with stakeholders to address
outstanding concerns related to infrastructure protections and how searchable structured data
is provided.
HB17-1177 Mediation for Disputes Arising Under CORA sponsored by Reps. Wist and
Garnett and Senator Cooke. This bill is intended to encourage record requesters and
governmental entities to resolve disputes through mediation rather than in the court system. The
bill would require the requesters and record custodians to evenly split the cost of hiring a
mediator. A strike below amendment was adopted by the Committee that simply requires a
meeting or call between the records custodian and requestor after a denial of a request but
before filing a request with district court to resolve a dispute. The meeting may include
recourse to any dispute resolution agreeable and paid for by both parties. The bill has passed
the Senate and the House.

HB17-1103 Sales and Use Tax Exemption for Historic Aircraft sponsored by Reps. Nordberg
and Pabon and Senators Moreno and Gardner. The bill is attempting to address an issue
regarding state historic aircraft owners wishing to loan their historic aircraft to museums in
Colorado without being taxed. The fiscal note only mentions a “potential impact.” The bill
passed both chambers.
HB17-1127 Exempt Feminine Hygiene Products from Sales Tax sponsored by Rep. Lontine
and Senator Martinez Humenik. The bill creates a state sales tax exemption, commencing
January 1, 2018, for all sales, storage, and use of feminine hygiene products. The bill has a
large fiscal note and will likely not survive the Appropriations Committee. The bill is waiting
to be calendared in the House Appropriations Committee.
HB17-1195 Create a State Sales Tax Exemption for Diapers sponsored by Rep. Winter and
Senator Martinez Humenik. The bill creates a sales tax exemption, commencing January 1, 2018
for the sale, storage and use of diapers. The bill further allows local taxing jurisdictions to adopt
the same exemption. The bill passed the House Finance Committee and is waiting to be
scheduled in the House Appropriations Committee.
BBMK is monitoring bills related to Construction Defects and has included them for Board
members interested in the issue.
HB17-1279 Construction Defect Actions Notice Vote Approval sponsored by Reps. Garnett
and Saine and Senators Tate and Guzman. The bill would require that a majority of a HOA’s
members approve the initiation of a legal complaint. The bill further mandates certain
disclosures to homeowners detailing the expected cost and time of pursuing a complaint and the
potential difficulty of selling their unit during a lawsuit. The bill passed the House State Affairs
Committee on Tuesday. The stakeholders agreed on a compromise on the following key
components to the bill: a decrease in tolling from 120 days to 90 days, a required public
meeting prior to the vote or filing of a claim, inclusion of bank-owned properties in the vote,
and a fifty percent plus one vote of all homeowners to enter litigation. The bill passed the
House on Third Reading 64-0 with one excused.
SB17-045 Construction Defect Claim Allocation of Defense Costs sponsored by Senators
Williams and Grantham and Reps. Wist and Duran. This is a bipartisan measure concerning a
requirement for the equitable allocation of the costs of defending a construction defect
claim. This bill will likely be postponed indefinitely because of the agreement on HB 1279.
SB17-156 Homeowners Association Construction Defect Lawsuit Approval Timelines
sponsored by Senator Hill and Rep. Wist. The bill is supported by the Homeownership
Opportunity Alliance, a large diverse coalition which has been leading the charge to change
Colorado Statutes as they pertain to construction litigation. The bill requires written consent of a

majority of homeowners in an association prior to initiating litigation, disclosure of the costs and
duration of litigation and a process for alternative dispute resolution. This bill was laid over
until May 12th, effectively killing the bill.

BBMK would like to provide an update of all the Transportation Ballot Initiatives filed to date.
Initiative 14 seeks to increase the state sales tax for twenty years beginning in 2018 from 2.9%

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MAY 2, 2017
President Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal

Secretary Chao, meanwhile, has stated that regulatory burdens in the project approval process, rather
than lack of Federal funding, are the largest impediment to advancing needed transportation projects –
potentially signaling her intent to propose significant regulatory relief measures.
Federal Appropriations for the Remainder of FY 2017:
For fiscal year 2017 (ending September 30, 2017), nearly all agencies and programs of the Federal
government continue to operate under a Continuing Resolution through Friday, April 28. To avoid a
shutdown of the Federal government, Congress must pass and President Trump must sign one or more
new spending bills by midnight on April 28.
Transportation Funding
With respect to transportation funding for the remainder of FY 2017, we understand that the House and
Senate have completed their negotiations based on the spending bills each chamber advanced last Spring;
we do not expect the final 2017 Transportation/HUD spending bill to include radical changes from
those House- and Senate-advanced bills. For example, we believe any debate on the future of the New
Starts program will play out in the discussion of FY 2018 spending later this spring.
This Federal Update is drafted before April 28; Mike Dino will provide more up-to-date information on
Federal spending measures for FY 2017 during his May 2 presentation.
Federal Appropriations and the President’s Budget Proposal for FY 2018:
We expect the President to release his full FY 2018 budget proposal for all agencies and programs of the
Federal government in mid-May. In addition to setting forth the President’s priorities for surface
transportation spending in FY 2018 – much of which is governed by the FAST Act – this proposal may
foretell what Trump will propose for transportation programs in his infrastructure bill later this year.
Transportation Funding
With President Trump’s FY 2018 “skinny budget” (released in March) proposing to support only New
Starts projects with signed FFGAs already in place, public transit stakeholders and Congressional
Democrats have launched an aggressive campaign championing the important role the Federal
government has played in New Starts projects. These efforts mainly seek to quantify the nationwide
benefits of – and therefore the Federal role in – funding for New Starts.
Work on House and Senate Transportation/HUD spending bills for FY 2018 is underway, with Member
funding requests and subcommittee hearings taking place in advance of introduction of any legislation.
Most Congressional Republicans have remained silent on Trump’s cuts to New Starts and the popular
TIGER program.
RTD’s Eagle P3 project continues to enjoy bipartisan Congressional support. In letters to House and
Senate Appropriations Committee leaders earlier this month, RTD’s entire Colorado Congressional
delegation requested full funding for the Eagle P3 FFGA through its final year: FY 2018.

Packet Pg. 38

Attachment: Federal Update 5 2 17 (3125 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

Details have been slow to emerge on the substance and timing of President Trump’s promised
infrastructure proposal. Trump’s OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, recently announced that the
Administration plans to provide approximately $200 billion in direct spending for infrastructure, which
he explained will be leveraged in a 5 to 1 ratio to achieve the President’s pledged $1 trillion in total
investment. Mulvaney cautioned that the plan won’t be ready until this Fall – well past the initial “first
100 days” pledge.
