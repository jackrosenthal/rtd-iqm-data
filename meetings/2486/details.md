#### 1. Approval of 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2016 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2016 Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $0.051 million to $1,500.674 million as detailed below in the overview of the 2016 Amended Budget, and to decrease the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $243.961 million to $843.221 million.

The 2016 Amended Budget appropriation includes the amounts in the Amended Budget column below (in thousands), which is a summary of relevant data from Exhibit I.

The 2016 Amended Budget also includes operating revenue and non-operating revenue which are estimated, not appropriated, below (in thousands), which is a summary of relevant data from Exhibit I.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 28, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, noted this is the first time staff has had to lower expenditures in quite some time.  She reiterated that RTD cannot appropriate revenues but must project revenues each year.  She indicated the Amended Budget shows revenue projections decreasing by $46.9 million on a combined basis.  Her team was able to make up for this deficit by working with staff to reduce capital and operating expenses.  She thanked everyone who worked so diligently on the Amended Budget process.

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reminded the Board that the 2016 Adopted Budget was approved in November 2015 and staff made changes in June to account for more accurate and updated information.  Staff will begin unfolding the 2017 Requested Budget in August with a request for approval in November.  She reviewed the 2016 Amended Budget available in the June 14, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  Staff will request adoption of the 2016 Amended Budget at the June 28, 2016 Board Meeting.

The adjustments being requested are:

Revenues be decreased by $46.9 million for a new total of $1,074.8 million.Operating expenditures be increased by $11.6 million for a new total of $647.1 million.  New capital expenditures be increased by $35.1 million for a new total of $520.0 million. Interest payments on debt be increased by $0.4 million for a new total of $117.8 million.The FasTracks Internal Savings Account be increased by $5.5 million for a new total of $28.9 million.  The Board-Appropriated Fund be increased by $0.03 million for a new total of $35.1 million.The Capital Replacement Fund be increased by $0.6 million for a new total of $27.9 million.i.              The unrestricted fund balance be decreased by $2.4 million for a new total of $13.4 million.

Previously approved capital expenditures be decreased by $243.9 million for a new total of $843.2 million.

Director Bagley thanked staff for being prudent in coming up with an Amended Budget that addresses the issues of fare revenue and sales and use tax being significantly below initial forecasts.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Approval of ConvergeOne Phone Switch Contract

It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with ConvergeOne for purchase of Avaya hardware, licenses, installation, and maintenance of RTD’s phone system. The estimated cost of the Avaya Phone Switch Upgrade of $865,000 includes installation costs of $355,750 which was approved in the 2016 Capital Budget and five (5) years of warranty, maintenance and support of $509,250 which will be included in future operations and maintenance budgets.

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 28, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather Copp introduced Brett Feddersen, Manager of Shared Technical Services, and asked him to provide a brief overview of the recommendation.  Brett Feddersen explained that this request is to purchase an upgrade to RTD’s Avaya Phone Switch.  He stated the current equipment is between 10 to 12 years old and support expires during the third quarter of this year.  He indicated the upgraded switch will provide more modern functionality and increase the number of licenses available, which is needed with the new rail line openings.  This is also a pre-requisite for the Telephone Information Center to upgrade their software.

Director Sisk asked what staff knew about ConvergeOne in terms of stability.  He wonders if there is any support from Avaya during our warranty period if ConvergeOne goes out of business.  He expressed concern that a five year warranty is not worth much if the company is no longer in business.  He urged staff to look at the strength of the vendor.  Brett Feddersen said he would have to look into if Avaya would provide any coverage but noted ConvergeOne is a premier Avaya partner.

Committee Chair Menten expressed that the support cost seemed like a lot of money when compared with the capital costs.  She wondered if there was something staff felt needed annual support as opposed for paying for on-demand support.  Brett Feddersen shared that the other bid received was $200K higher.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

Committee Chair Menten stated that while she voted yes this evening, she would like to have additional information about how often RTD needs support to justify those high costs.  She would also like Director Sisk’s question answered.  Heather Copp stated staff would provide the Board with the answers before the Board Meeting.

#### 1. SmartCard Project Update

Heather Copp asked Tonya Anderson, SMT Project Administrator, to review the highlights of the SmartCard Project Update that was included in the June 14, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Tonya Anderson noted that since the Update was prepared, staff has learned some new information related to the external hosting of the SMT environment.  She said that although the report says the next activity will be deploying the disaster recovery environment that will not be until the July/August timeframe.  She shared that 50 handheld Smart Media Readers had been deployed with completion anticipated by the end of July.  Tonya Anderson stated that staff is approximately 50% complete with site surveys for the first Retail point of Sale test locations at King Soopers.  Albertsons-Safeway’s legal department is reviewing the terms and conditions and staff anticipates receiving comments next week.

Heather Copp reminded the Board that the plan as of the last Committee meeting was for the web portal to go live at the end of June; however, last week staff received a security assessment from Xerox and was not happy with the results.  She said the good news is that from a functional standpoint it appears everything is working very well but based on the security assessment it is not likely staff will meet the go-live date of June 30.  She stated Xerox has committed to producing a new report to identify any remaining issues by June 29, but this will give staff very little time to mitigate.

Heather Copp shared that RTD would be hiring a 3rd party assessor to review the report along with RTD’s Cyber Security Manager.  She explained that staff is very concern that our system is as secure as possible for our customers because they will be putting their credit card information into the web portal.   She reiterated that staff would not know if the June 30 go-live date would be possible until receiving the new assessment so she wanted to apprise the Board of the situation.

Director Hoy pointed out that if Xerox is not providing their report until June 29 it will likely take a third party some time to complete an assessment after that.  He said this review could feasibly take another month or longer.  Heather Copp stated this was why she did not give the Board a new go-live date.  She shared that staff thought they would be given a more detailed report two weeks ago but were not happy with what was provided.

Director Deadwyler expressed that it was very disappointing that there continue to be problems with the SmartCard.  She wonders if the program will ever be fully up and running or if RTD should be looking at something else.  She asked how long it took other agencies to implement similar programs.

Director Lubow inquired as to the lessons learned from this project.  She expressed concern that this report was received at the last minute.  Heather Copp stated everyone has been pushing for this date.  She said from a functional standpoint staff was happy and surprised with the product Xerox delivered; however, related to security staff had a difference of opinion from Xerox.  She stated Xerox had a delivery date, delivered what they thought was satisfactory, and staff disagreed.  She thinks Xerox is on the same page now.  She explained the reason this just came up is that security must be tested in the same environment as if it were available to the public which was not ready until just recently.  Heather Copp stated no one was more disappointed than the team and they would not be letting up.

Director Lubow wondered if perhaps there was a communication lapse or if this was just an optimistic schedule.  Heather Copp stated she did not think there was but it was something being discussed with Xerox.  She said everyone knew this was an optimistic schedule from the very beginning.

General Manager Genova reiterated that launching the web portal has always been a very aggressive schedule and said he has been pushing the team very hard.  The team has been working diligently and a lot of hours.  He wishes the Board knew how hard he has been pushing them; however, he is not going to risk going live with a system that staff is not comfortable with when it comes to people’s credit cards.

Director Bagley asked staff to explain how the payments to Xerox work.  He thinks Xerox needs to understand that there are no further payments until the web portal works.  He said his sense is that Xerox is not as responsive as they could be.  Tonya Anderson explained that payments are made based on milestones, for example when they delivered design documents and RTD staff accepted the document.

Committee Chair Menten thanked staff for making security a priority as no one wants to have any incidents involving credit card information.

#### 2. First Quarter 2016 Performance Report

Jannette Scarpino reviewed the First Quarter 2016 Performance Report that was included in the June 14, 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  She noted there were several areas where RTD or the private carriers did not meet goal, such as safety incidents or level of customer complaints, but overall both RTD and the contractors are doing well.  She believes some of the lower performing areas will improve as the operator and mechanic vacancies are improving.

Committee Chair Menten said something notable is the on-time performance improving for Access-a-Ride.  She asked staff to share with those companies the Board’s appreciation.

#### 3. April 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller, commented there was still a lot of red on the dashboard.  He said year-to-date sales and use tax was down 4.9%, ridership was down 5.1% and fare revenue was down 12.5% versus the budget.  He explained when staff presents this next month the numbers should align better if the 2016 Amended Budget is approved.

Director Bagley thanked staff for being as prudent as they have been in reference to the sales and use tax and fare revenue.  He believes this demonstrates that the economy is in a lull from the continual up-up-up of years past.  He does not blame the CU Leeds School of business for their forecasts but it is important that staff reacts.  He believes staff has done a good job reacting.  He reiterated that the 2016 Amended Budget demonstrates that RTD is being prudent from a fiscal sustainability standpoint.

Committee Chair Menten shared that she and Director Lubow thought it might be good to have a brief presentation on the Eagle P3 project and financing now that one of the lines is operational.  She said this will be at the July Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Menten adjourned the meeting at 8:11 p.m.
