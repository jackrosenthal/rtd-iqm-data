RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Base Salary
Compensation Range
REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022. The Third Amendment to the Agreement
provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and
benchmarking analysis that will be used by the Board in consultation with GM/CEO Johnson to
determine her compensation for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023.
Following a competitive solicitation, Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. (Gallagher) was selected to conduct
a comprehensive and systematic benchmarking analysis of the total compensation package for the
GM/CEO, including both external market-based factors and internal equity considerations, to ensure
competitiveness in pay practices. This analysis intended to inform the Board in its decisions on
compensation for the GM/CEO position relative to market considerations. The results of the study were
presented to the Performance Committee on November 16, 2022.
On September 26, 2023, the Board approved its Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO, which
outlines principles to guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation, including the
following:
•

Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

•

Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

During the October 2, 2023, Performance Committee (Committee) meeting, Committee members having
reviewed the Gallagher study considered the recommended GM/CEO Base Salary Range based on the full
market data of comparable organizations as follows:
The Committee noted that the data used to establish the recommended base salary range was nearly 12
months old. Consequently, to remain competitive with the market, an aging factor was recommended to
account for market changes that may have occurred since the November 2022 report resulting in a
recommended adjusted GM/CEO Base Salary Range of:
•

Minimum: $292,600 Midpoint: $402,325 Maximum: $512,050

The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures changes in the cost of employees to employers over time. In
the private sector, business owners and human resources professionals can use the ECI to make
decisions about pay adjustments to help them stay competitive. In the public sector, the Federal Reserve
and others use the ECI to gauge the health of the labor market, adjust contracts, and research the labor
market. (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics)
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the Board honors the intent of the Compensation Philosophy for
the GM/CEO and establishes a market competitive base salary range designed to attract and retain a
GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience to lead and inspire an
innovative, complex, and unique multi-modal transit agency.
Further, in adopting this recommended action, the Board will honor its commitment to establishing a
base compensation range for the GM/CEO position, consistent with the 2010 State Audit on Executive
Compensation Practice and will bring the agency into alignment with its wage transparency obligations
under the Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Establishing a base salary range for the GM/CEO position does not automatically equate to a change in
the current GM/CEO's base compensation, as that is governed by the existing term contract.

STUDY BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Purpose of Study and Study Scope
In the spring of 2022, RTD issued a request for proposal to conduct a compensation study for
RTD covering the transportation industry GM/CEO positions. This study includes collecting
market data using a custom survey and published survey sources to analyze and evaluate all
data in an objective manner and make recommendations designed to assist RTD in attracting,
recruiting, and retaining top performing talent. Specifically, the identified project objectives were:




Identify and document the basis for selection of minimum of ten comparable agencies for
external benchmarking to include a comparison to equivalent positions with similar function,
scope, and a comparison to agencies with the transit industry, comparable governmental
entities, and comparable geographic markets.
Conduct independent external total compensation survey (base salary, incentive pay, paid
leave, benefits, and pension), compile data, and perform external benchmarking analysis.



Collect market salary data utilizing custom and published survey sources (where applicable);



Analyze market base compensation (actual pay and pay ranges) for benchmark jobs to
evaluate market competitiveness;



Conduct internal equity assessment of GM/CEO total compensation as compared to non –
represented RTD employees;



Recommend a base salary range and market midpoint for the GM/CEO position.



Present findings reflecting total compensation market research, benchmarking and internal
equity analysis and recommendations to RTD Board Performance and full Board of
Directors.

In spring 2022, Gallagher submitted a proposal to RTD to perform the work requested and the
work began in October 2022. Below are the specific phase activities of the project as identified
and submitted in the proposal and agreed upon by Gallagher consultants and RTD.

RTD Compensation System
RTD currently does not have a salary schedule for all the GM/CEO position. RTD has
recognized that as time has progressed and changes in the economy and labor market have
taken place, the need for a GM/CEO salary schedule has become apparent; one that will help
RTD to be more attractive to prospective and current employees.

STUDY PROCESS
In October 2022, Gallagher consultants met with RTD’ Project manager. The purpose of the
meeting was to:



Review the presentation and to discuss coordination for the upcoming employee information
sessions;
Discuss market comparators for the custom survey;



Confirm subordinate positions for equity pay;



Confirm the project timeline;



Discuss RTD Denver’s current GM/CEO total compensation;



Discuss expectations for final report and presentation.

At the end of the meeting, Gallagher consultants and RTD project manager were clear on the
timeline, information needed from RTD to conduct the study, deliverables and how to approach
the upcoming project phases.
.
In early October 2022, RTD provided a list of 20 comparator organizations being used in connection to
parallel compensation study for non-represented employees. Gallagher consultants reviewed the list
and confirmed that these were comparable agencies. The comparators selected, were identified and
chosen based on a variety of factors to include:

In mid-October, the data collection form (survey) containing the GM/CEO benchmark job was
sent to RTD for its review, consideration, and approval. On October 18, 2022, RTD approved
the data collection form (survey) to be sent to the comparator organizations. The survey was
then sent to the comparator organizations with a requested submission date of November 31,
2022. During the survey completion timeframe, Gallagher and RTD made several follow-up
emails and phone calls to the comparator organizations to solicit participation and to answer any
questions the comparator organizations had about the survey or study.

cuts where possible for cross-industry jobs). The combination of the custom survey and
published market data is reflected in the findings and recommendations detailed at the end of
this report.
Throughout the study, Gallagher consultants met regularly with RTD Project Team to discuss
milestones, needs, deliverables, and any concerns.

STUDY FINDINGS
In October 2022, with the responses to the custom survey received, market data collected from
published survey sources, and to provide RTD with preliminary cost for upcoming budget
deliberations, Gallagher consultants met with RTD’ Project manager to review the preliminary
compensation analysis and results.
Salary Comparisons
Custom and Published Survey Data Collection and Analysis
Of the twenty comparator organizations identified and surveyed, Gallagher summarized
responses from 13 out of 20 (65%) organizations invited to participate in the survey. The custom
survey was supplemented with published survey data representative of the public and private
sector.
Gallagher reviewed and analyzed the obtained published and custom survey data using
statistical tools and sought clarification with the participating organizations to validate matches
for those jobs where the data seemed to be an outlier. Gallagher follows the U.S Department of
Justice and Federal Trade Commission guidelines, which states five job matches should exist
per job to conduct statistical analyses or draw conclusions.

Geographic Adjustments and Aging Market Salary Data
Two important adjustments made to the data was to account for the differences in the cost of
labor for the Denver, Colorado as compared to other areas within the United States as well as
aging of the published survey data forward to account for pay changes that may have occurred
during the study timeframe. Aging factors were not applied to the custom survey market salary
data. It represents current effective salaries at participant organizations.
The cost of labor refers to the difference in pay or labor market for a job from one location to
another. The cost of labor is what a particular geographic market offers as the “going rate” or
compensation for its jobs and reflects the local demand for and supply of labor. Thus, if market
data were collected from a particular geographic location, they were adjusted downward/upward
based on Colorado’s cost of labor differential.

Market Comparison Results
Once all data were collected, reviewed, and analyzed for alignment with RTD’ benchmark jobs,
Gallagher compared RTD’ actual salaries for GM/CEO position with the market data collected. The
difference from the market for each benchmark is calculated as follows:


RTD data minus Market data divided by the market data:
– A positive figure indicates that RTD pay above the market.
– A negative figure indicates that RTD pay below the market.

The following guidelines were used when determining the competitive nature of RTD’ current
compensation:

Following the standard compensation guidelines outlined above, RTD GM/CEO salary is
competitive with the 50th percentile full market at -3%.
More specifically, further analysis of the full market (custom and published survey public and
private sector data combined) revealed that:


RTD pay is highly competitive with the full market (50%),



Significantly above the lowest levels of the full market (25%).
Competitive with leading salaries with the custom industry survey (75%),

A variance greater than +/- 15% difference with the market is significantly misaligned. Such
variance does not necessarily mean misalignment. Factors such as performance, turnover
and longevity impact actual salaries and may explain some of the differences between RTD
and the market actual salaries for individual jobs

Proposed Salary Range Adjustments
To analyze the competitiveness of the pay and propose a pay range for the RTD GM/CEO job,
Gallagher reviewed the market to identify potential impact of job placement and implementation
costs:


We proposed a salary schedule by comparing the market 50th percentile of actual pay to
create a pay grade midpoint and structure.



This is based on the general assumption that most organizations typically build
competitive salary structure ranges for hiring and retention by anchoring the structure at
the market 50th percentile (or median) of actual salaries or based on compensation
philosophy to support recruitment and retention.

To keep up with competitive market hiring and retention, we recommend RTD review the
proposed pay grade (closest pay grade aligned to the full market 50th actual salary)
based on internal factors such as comparable positions in the current pay grade, career levels,
supervisor-subordinate relationships.
Implementation Options
It is important for RTD to implement the proposed GM/CEO salary range adjustments through a
consistent pay implementation process to reduce potential salary compression issues and
impact of inflation.
Cost implementation analysis (provided there is a change) includes employee pay adjustments
within the current or recommended range based on GM/CEO current pay rate and years of
service in position

organizations was 3.5%. Overall average total increase was 5.75%, this is further affirmed by
Department of Labor average wage increase data that notes a 5+% year over year increase in
the most recent report for the average U.S. worker. RTD’ average total increase to the
GM/CEO was 6.5%. The national data came from the World at Work 2021-2022 Salary Budget
Survey. The trend for the future where average increases will continue to be above historic or
dated figures. Few participant organizations gave other types of bonus pay. The Average
Bonus pay percentage was 3.5%.

Internal Pay Equity Analysis Summary

Identifying Pay Compression

Goal

Internal pay equity assessment of GM/CEO’s total compensation as compared
to non-represented RTD employees.

Methodology

Best practice of 20% differential between the supervisor's pay and the
subordinate's pay.

Findings

The total compensation of the GM/CEO is equitable compared to nonrepresented RTD employees.

Internal Pay Equity Assessment
•
•

•
•
•

•

Gallagher determined that the total compensation of the GM/CEO is equitable.
Gallagher determined that the base salary of the GM/CEO is 37% higher than
the highest paid subordinate employee.
• Formula used: Supervisor pay - Subordinates pay ÷ Subordinates pay
Additional compensation and perquisites provided to the GM/CEO include deferred
comp and incentive awards.
These are all considered reasonable and consistent with that provided by peer
organizations.
RTD does not appear to provide vehicle allowance, club membership,
supplemental retirement, executive long-term disability (LTD) supplemental life
insurance, employer paid retiree health insurance, and/or disability insurance to
the GM/CEO, which are common elements of the total compensation package
provided to comparator industry GM/CEOs.
Determine if subordinates are paid equitably compared to their supervisor.

Thoughts

55%

This range spread would be consistent with
current non-represented employee pay
structures.

75%

This range spread would encompass the full
market range for this role based on the
market.

The compensation paid to the General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO) has been
compared against the compensation data from comparable organizations in this report. Our findings
indicate that the total compensation paid to the GM/CEO is competitive with the market when
compared with comparable organizations. This level of compensation should be considered
reasonable with potential opportunities to increase overall compensation with market trends.
Should the GM/CEO pay increase to the market median, it would still be reasonable.
1. The Custom Survey data showed that the GM/CEO was competitive (+/-10%) with
the market median salary in comparison to the GM/CEO in the
comparator organizations.
2. The Published survey data showed that the GM/CEO was possibly misaligned (+/10-15%) with the market median salary.
3. The Full Market data (Custom and Published) showed that the GM/CEO was
competitive (+/-10%) with the market median salary.

The recommended salary range to RTD’ GM/CEO based on the full market data of comparable
organizations is:

Minimum- $280,000 Midpoint- $385,000 Maximum- $490,000

The implementation strategy/plan is based on the following aspects:

Employees will be paid within the new pay range, meaning the employee will not be paid
below the minimum.



The salary does not fall above the new pay range maximum.



Recommend continued movement of current employee through the range, based on the
highly competitive talent market of senior and executive leadership.



Conduct regular review of GM/CEO compensation and relevant market data to ensure
that a competitive salary is maintained and to ensure reasonability of executive pay.



Update GM/CEO range to remain competitive to the market on biennial to annual basis.

Next Steps and Recommendations
The following next steps are being recommended to RTD upon the conclusion of the
compensation study:


RTD adopts the Gallagher proposed GM/CEO salary range and the supporting strategies
based on the data received and analysis performed;



RTD determines the timeframe and/or phases for implementing the Gallagher proposed
GM/CEO salary range, implementation options and any proposed changes to benefits
(immediate, phase in over 2 year, 3 years, etc.).

Ongoing Administration
Gallagher recommends that pay administration guidelines should be implemented for placing
and moving the GM/CEO employee through the proposed salary range. Based on this, and in
closing, we recommend the following:


Looking ahead, conduct regular reviews of the compensation system and relevant market
data to ensure that a competitiveness with the market is maintained:
o
o
o

The GM/CEO salary range should be adjusted by a structure movement trend factor
every year to remain competitive with the market.
The GM/CEO overall benefits should be analyzed and adjusted by using a market
trend comparison regularly to remain competitive with the market.
Advance GM/CEO incumbent pay through the assigned pay range based on time in
position or longevity to mitigate compression, while also considering overall
performance. This ensures the following:




Actual pay for new hire GM/CEO subordinates are differentiated by minimum
20% lower than GM/CEO pay.
The more tenured GM/CEO becomes, the closer their pay rate is aligned to
market target rate.
Refine the RTD Compensation Philosophy and its gradual and/or immediate
implementation.

CONCLUSION & GOING FORWARD
The report presents independent data to guide and inform future compensation decisions as per
the “safe harbor” provision of the intermediate Sanctions law. As part of this study, it is the intent
to provide the board with information intended to assist them in determining if total
compensation paid to the GM/CEO is more than “reasonable compensation” in accordance with
Section 4958 (intermediate Sanctions) of the internal Revenue Code. This is a
standard/regulation by which our practice follows in considering executive compensation for
public sector and higher education clients.
The current pay for the GM/CEO is reasonable. RTD compensation level for the GM/CEO is
competitive compared to similar executive jobs in the market. This level of compensation should
also be considered reasonable with potential opportunities to increase overall compensation
with market trends.
Compensation is often seen as a major reason executive like the RTD GM/CEO go to work for
an organization and remain employed by them. Through the study, RTD can design a long-term
compensation strategy that will enable the organization to move forward, attract and retain their
leadership well into the future.
Gallagher is prepared to support RTD in its compensation efforts by responding to requests for
advice, support, and services from RTD’ management staff. We are available via email,
telephone and can be on-site.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Strategic Plan Customer Excellence and Community Value
Survey Results

October 16, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
60 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting a five-year strategic plan (Plan), the Board established four strategic priorities and their
associated success outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Success Outcome
Community Value: RTD Strives to be a strong community
Establish baseline for community value
partner, providing value to customers as well as to the
index and increase by 5%
broader Denver Metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver
high-quality customer service

Establish baseline for customer
promoter score and increase by 5%

net

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a
highly skilled and engaged workforce

Establish baseline for employee
promoter score and increase by 5%

net

Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management
of all financial resources

50% of outcome is that RTD spends less
money than it receives; 50% of outcome
is that the community believes that it
sees value in RTD’s spending

Regarding the strategic priorities of Customer Excellence and Community Value, a community and
customer survey was completed in 2021 to discern the agency’s community value index and customer
net promoter score (NPS) for that year. The 2021 survey results serve as the baseline data against
which future progress is measured for the strategic priorities of Customer Excellence and Community
Value.
DISCUSSION
Culminating from a competitive request for proposals, and Board authorization on June 27, 2023, ETC
Institute was awarded a three-year contract with two one-year options to conduct the community value
and customer surveys beginning in 2023. The instruments for both surveys were based on those
developed in 2021 and 2022 to ensure consistency in data collection and reporting.

Packet Pg. 31

1.D.1

Customer Excellence Survey
1. Methodology
For the bus and rail surveys, the sampling plan was inclusive of the entire service area, included all bus
routes and light and commuter rail lines, and accounted for time of day. Surveys were conducted via
customer intercepts. For the paratransit customer survey, sampling was derived from active customers
who were contacted by a combination of text message, email, and mail for survey distribution.
All customer surveys were available in English and Spanish. Language assistance services were made
available in an additional 20 languages. Lastly, for customers who are blind or visually impaired,
assistance was made available through the agency’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office to
complete the surveys.
The bus and rail surveys were conducted from September 11 through 24, 2023 and the paratransit
customer survey ran from September 9 through September 29, 2023.

2. Customer Characteristics
Respondents are representative of the Denver metro area. The services the agency provides are
important to the region’s economy, with work being the primary trip purpose for bus and rail customers.
The demographics of the agency’s bus and rail customers are most likely to be male and 18 to 39 years
old and likely to be Caucasian. That being said, nearly 50% of customers are Hispanic, Spanish, or
Latino/a/x or Black/African American. For paratransit, customers are most likely to be female, older than
65 years of age, and white or Caucasian. More than 30% of the remaining paratransit customers are
Hispanic, Spanish, or Latino/a/x or Black/African American. Additionally, 61% of bus customers and
48% of rail customers have a household income of less than $50,000. For paratransit, 70% of
customers have a household income of less than $25,000. Bus and rail customers are heavily reliant on
RTD’s transit services, at 74% and 67%, respectively. Close to half of paratransit customers use RTD’s
services for medical appointments.
3. Survey Results: Satisfaction Measures and Customer NPS
Overall satisfaction for bus and rail services has improved since 2022, and satisfaction with paratransit
services remains high. Moreover, 76% of bus customers and 78% of rail customers are satisfied or very
satisfied with RTD’s services. In comparison to the national average of bus and rail customers, RTD’s
bus customers are 18% more satisfied and its rail customers are 17% more satisfied. Customers who
are satisfied or very satisfied are a strong indicator that they will continue to use RTD’s services.
Additionally, the percentage of very dissatisfied bus and rail customers has decreased compared to
2022.

Packet Pg. 32

1.D.1

Compared to 2022, with the exception of rail, the customer NPS scores are down. The NPS scores are
still above zero, meaning the agency has more promoters than detractors, and bus and rail scores are
above the national average.

Surveys were mailed to a random sample of USPS addresses within the RTD service area. The surveys
were available in English and Spanish and were administered from September 9 through September 22,
2023. Language assistance services were made available in an additional 20 languages. Lastly, for blind
or visually impaired customers, assistance was made available through the agency’s ADA Office to
complete the surveys.
2. Survey Results: Perceived Value and Community NPS
Community opinion of RTD’s personal value and value to the region has improved since 2022 and is
higher than the national average. Results show that 84% of community members believe that RTD
provides value to the region, 54% believe that RTD provides value to them personally, 34% have a good
or very good overall opinion of the agency. Moreover, 87% of community members believe that the

agency’s funding should be somewhat or much greater than it is now. In comparison to the national
average, RTD’s value ratings for community value and personal value are 19% and 25% greater,
respectively. Community NPS is 18 points above the national average, though it is down 11 points
