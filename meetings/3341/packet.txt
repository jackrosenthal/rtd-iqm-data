Following the conclusion of the third-party consultant contract, the GM/CEO recommended to the Board

belonging.

Growth Mindset

The human brain is an amazing thing. It is capable of adapting,
expanding and reshaping. A “Fixed Mindset” is when one believes they
can’t change or try new strategies. A “Growth Mindset” is a mind open
to breaking outside of our assumptions.

• Opportunity to avoid the traps of common cognitive biases
