Proposed Tactical Plans for Strategic Goals/Priorities from March 1, 2014
RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Advance

On March 1, 2014, Board members and the SLT convened an Advance to mutually
discuss and agree upon strategic goals for the agency. These goals/priorities are meant to
drive the 2015 budget cycle. For example, goals established at the 2013 Advance are
driving the 2014 budget cycle and priorities.
The Board will recall that we came out of the Advance with four priorities:





Advancing/Completing FasTracks (Tactical Plan at Enclosure #1)
Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan (Tactical Plan at Enclosure #2)
Improve Service Delivery (Tactical Plan at Enclosure #3)
Implement Technological Advancements (including Smart Cards) (Tactical Plan at
Enclosure #4)

In accordance with the Board Policy on the Goal Setting process for the General Manager,
the General Manager is to present the agreed upon goals/priorities with his tactical plan to
implement those priorities/goals at the April 22, 2014 Board Study Session.
I will indeed present the tactical plan at the study session on Tuesday, April 22, 2014. In
advance of the short presentation at the study session, please find attached the proposed
tactical plans that staff proposes to implement to realize the strategic goals set forth.
As always, we welcome your input/feedback.

Our mission:
To meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.

2.1.b

Strategic Goal #1
Advancing/Completing FasTracks
Background
RTD will continue to work with stakeholders, FTA, CDOT, and industry to develop
partnerships and identify opportunities to complete the FasTracks program and support
corridor operations once construction is complete. Since FasTracks was approved, two
projects have been completed (West and Denver Union Station), and most others projects
are in construction with fully committed funding. RTD has been able to achieve this
despite radical changes to the economy from what was projected in the 2004 FasTracks
financial plan. It has done so in large part by availing itself of all opportunities to obtain
funding from sources that are in addition to RTD sales tax revenue. Corollary to that
strategy RTD has listened to private sector interest, federal funding criteria, and the voices
of its constituents as expressed by local and state government entities willing to commit
funds to projects, in determining when, where, and how to build. For remaining FasTracks
projects, RTD intends to stay that course.
Since the March 2014 Strategic Planning Advance, RTD accomplished a major FasTracks
milestone with the North Metro Line (DUS to 124th) groundbreaking. With North Metro
underway, completion of FasTracks consists of identifying and securing funding for the
following projects:




Southeast, Central, and Southwest Corridor Extensions
Completion of North Metro Rail Line to State Highway 7
Completion of Northwest Rail Line from Westminster to Longmont

The narrative below describes the most promising tactical approaches to funding this
remaining group of FasTracks projects.
Financing Packages that Include non-RTD Funding
The likelihood of a FasTracks project moving forward is significantly enhanced when RTD
is not the sole source of funding. This could come in a number of forms, as the District
has previously demonstrated: local municipality financial participation; Federal grants and
loans; private equity (P3 or unsolicited proposal with financing); and tax increment
financing. RTD will actively work to influence the direction of future Federal surface
transportation re-authorization, since the District has competitive projects and a solid
Federal grant and loan track record. RTD will continue to identify FasTracks projects that
meet criteria for federal and state competitive grants, and aggressively pursue these grants
Enclosure 1 – Page 1

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2015

as opportunities arise. Further, RTD will seek implementation of public private partnership
proposals for FasTracks, and for other projects, which provide benefits to RTD and fit
within the financial plans.
Seeking and obtaining federal funds, private sector efficiencies, and revenue sources that
augment sales tax revenue without reducing ridership will in part dictate when, where and
how remaining corridors are completed. RTD is in the federal “pipeline” for a Full Funding
Grant Agreement for its Southeast Corridor extension project. RTD has seen federal criteria
and availability of funds change over the years and believes it is in the district’s best
interest to seize those opportunities when available, as those opportunities can be lost. If
this grant is awarded, RTD will be closer to completion of the entire FasTracks plan.
Implementation of the full program will hopefully be accelerated by federal grant use on
other eligible projects.
Voter-Approved Funding Initiative
While MPACT64 will not go forward in 2014, the possibility remains that RTD could
benefit from a future regional or statewide sales tax initiative. Depending on the
magnitude of the additional sales tax, some or all of the unfunded FasTracks projects
could be completed sooner. RTD will continue to collaborate with CDOT, Move Colorado,
CASTA, the Chambers, the Metro Mayors Caucus, and other non-governmental
organizations to explore District-wide or State-wide funding opportunities.
Additional Revenue Sources
Although insufficient by themselves, RTD will continue to pursue additional revenue
sources not previously relied upon to fund FasTracks. These include items identified in the
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) such as sale/lease opportunities (note that many RAM items
are currently in progress, and will continue to be pursued). Previously unutilized FasTracks
revenue sources could include parking fees; value capture mechanisms; leasing and
contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be operated by third
parties at a cost saving; and corporate sponsorship of major project components (stations
for example). To increase revenue for all projects, RTD has brought forth initiatives
including advertising, parking, and shared facilities on a variety of TOD and joint
development projects and will continue to bring new ideas to the board so as to bring all
projects to completion. Additional opportunities include: pursuit of partnerships with
FasTracks stakeholders to provide additional local match funds to complete FasTracks
corridors; development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas,
walkways and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where RTD
and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development and

2.1.b

amenities and operating cost; and exploring support of efforts to collect sales tax revenues
on Internet sales.
Other Strategies to Expedite Project Delivery & Other Financial Tools
During the North Metro procurement process, RTD explored the possibility of packaging
multiple corridors with one bidder. While we have not yet been able to exercise any of the
options presented through that procurement, the approach should continue to be on the
table. There may be instances where significant cost components of a FasTracks project
can be eliminated or completed more cost-effectively by RTD or a third party, without
compromising safety or the project’s primary mobility purpose.
Further, to improve TABOR capacity, RTD will continue to refinance bond issues and
capital leases for savings and issues certificates of participation where economically
advantageous. Another tool RTD will consider is leasing and contracting for the operation
and management of assets that can be operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as
parking facilities. In summary, RTD will continue to plan for and deliver sound financial
recommendations to advance the FasTracks program.
Close
Outside of the scope of the FasTracks plan, RTD has also worked with the region to look
at how mobility needs and assumptions have changed over the past 10 years and will
wherever appropriate, suggest updated and better alternatives to meet mobility needs of
our constituents. The Northwest Area Mobility Study, initiated in 2013, is an example of
an effort looking at both FasTracks implementation and needs beyond FasTracks.
Moving forward, all project partnership and funding opportunities will be examined with
the goal of completing FasTracks and improving service District-wide. This will be done, as
always, within the broader context of the RTD long-term financial plan to ensure that RTD
has the long-term financial capacity to enter into any agreements or provide local match to
grants, and to operate any assets that will be constructed or acquired under those
agreements.

Strategic Goal #2
Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan
Background
Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions, ranging from double-digit year-over-year growth in sales and
use tax collections to a recession that caused RTD sales and use tax collections to drop
10% in a single year. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2015
relates to fiscal sustainability and financial planning, to enable RTD to continue to achieve
its mission to meet its constituents’ transportation needs in a cost-effective manner. As a
part of this goal, the Board and staff identified four specific focus areas:





Innovative financing
Current and long-range budgeting
Innovative and fiscally-sustainable service, including para-transit and employee
retention
Financial plan for cost effective service of asset age/debt load, plus remaining TABOR
capacity

Each of these areas will be addressed in 2015, with the overall intent of delivering fiscally
sustainable and innovative financial plans for the six-year time horizon of the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP), and through the 2040 horizon year of the DRCOG Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP).
Innovative Financing
RTD will continue to identify opportunities to enhance its revenues, reduce its capital and
operating costs, and provide new and innovative long-term financing opportunities.
Potential strategies to do so include, but are not limited to, the following:







Refinancing existing bond issues and capital leases for savings
Issuance of Certificates of Participation (COP) to finance eligible assets
Pursuit of partnerships with FasTracks stakeholders to provide additional local match
funds to complete FasTracks corridors
Implementation of private public partnerships proposals for FasTracks, and for other
projects, which provide benefits to RTD and fit within the financial plans
Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on Internet sales
Leasing and contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be
operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as parking facilities






Development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas, walkways
and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where RTD and
developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development and
amenities and operating cost Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with
existing of future RTD operations
Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes
Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise

Current and Long-range Budgeting
RTD will develop and implement a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and annual Budget for
Board approval. These plans will include innovative approaches to balance the SBP and
Budget in order to sustain service delivery and implement to the degree possible the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force recommendations and the General Manager 2015 goals as
established by the Board.
Based on the Regional Transportation Plan prepared by DRCOG and the goals and
objectives adopted by the Board of Directors, RTD develops its six-year SBP each year.
The SBP is a fiscally constrained plan which presents aggregate projected service levels
and capital and expense projects expected to be undertaken for the next six years.
Projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits, how well they meet the
RTD mission statement, and they are constrained to operate within the forecast of
revenues available for their completion and operation. The first year of the SBP capital and
operating program serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
During the development of the SBP and Budget, RTD staff will provide the Board with
relevant information and deliver frequent updates. The Board is given the opportunity to
offer early and substantive input into the development of RTD’s budget plans. Once the
SBP and Budget are adopted by the Board, RTD staff will maintain controls throughout the
year and deliver the service as approved by the Board.
The FasTracks Team conducts an annual program evaluation (APE) of scope, schedule,
costs and revenues to modify the program as necessary to meet goals. The APE allows
the agency to address trends and to make necessary modifications to the program while
keeping our commitment to be fiscally responsible, efficient and cost effective. The
process allows RTD to be proactive in making prudent management decisions and
establishing strategies for cost containment, value engineering and innovation to complete
the program as soon as possible. In addition, in 2014 DRCOG will be extending the time
horizon of the RTP from 2035 to 2040. As part of that process, RTD will be re-examining
its financial plan for the completion of FasTracks to identify other opportunities to
complete additional projects within the extended time horizon of the RTP.

2.1.c

In accordance with the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations, RTD will
continue to pursue new revenue opportunities including:






Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
Joining with the State audit department to verify tax compliance and reporting of
RTD tax collections
Corporate sponsorships and naming rights contracts
Charging all patrons to use RTD parking facilities
Charging for tolling and managed lanes

In addition, RTD will continue to explore revenue sources such as the sale of assets and
easements not required for transit purposes, leasing and contracting for the operation and
management of assets that can be operated by third parties at a cost savings, developing
shared facilities where RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for
both site development and operating costs. RTD will also continue to assess other
program funding or acceleration opportunities as they arise, such as federal and state
grants.
RTD will continue to explore cost savings as part of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
recommendations as follows: 1) service optimization to match the cost of services
provided with available funding sources, 2) technology and energy innovation that involves
lighting upgrades and energy efficiency in building systems expected to produce
quantifiable cost savings, and 3) partnerships and privatizations that could include such
items as privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce
expenses. Finally, RTD will manage its financial condition by 1) removing the volatility
from sales and use tax projections by continuing its contract with the CU-Leeds School of
Business for improved quarterly sales and use tax forecasting, and 2) adhering to its fund
balance policy based on recommended best practices and to include a Board-appropriated
fund and capital acquisition fund.
Innovative and Fiscally-Sustainable Service, Including Para-Transit And Employee Retention
RTD staff and Board continue to focus on RTD’s mission to meet our constituents’ present
and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean reliable, courteous, accessible and
cost-effective service throughout the District. These services include fixed route bus
service, light rail service, paratransit services for the general public (Call-n-Ride) and transit
services for individuals with disabilities (Access-a-Ride) as well as services provided by
partner agencies and supported by RTD (van pools etc.). Staff will continue to work with

Enclosure 2 – Page 3

Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Enclosure 2 - Fiscal Sustainability Financial Plan (1929 : GM 2015 Tactical Plans from Strategic Planning Session)

Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations

the Board of Directors to ensure that services are delivered in an efficient manner while
also recognizing the financial realities facing the organization.
In order to ensure that services continue to meet the ever-changing needs of our
community, RTD implements service changes three times per year, in January, May; when
school lets out and August; when school resumes. The timing of these changes is set
forth in our Collective Bargaining Agreement with our represented employees. Under
normal circumstances these service changes or “run boards” in our jargon, allow RTD to
adjust the levels of transit service provided to better correspond to the level of service
needed by our customers. These service changes also provide the means by which RTD
adjusts levels of service to conform to prevailing economic conditions and to respond to
changes in operational conditions.
When evaluating potential changes in RTD services, RTD staff considers several factors.
Primary among these guiding service planning principles are:







The performance of these services (ridership) based upon RTD Service Standards
(ridership per hour of transit service provided, subsidy per passenger boarding, etc.);
The effects of the potential changes on the overall transit network (system impacts)
and on transit dependent riders;
The availability of reasonable alternative transit services;
The ability to enhance services when possible given financial circumstances;
The distribution/impacts of such changes throughout the District and throughout the
RTD’s Family of Services (Local, Express, Regional, Call-n-ride, LRT, etc.); and
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to be sure that services are equitably provided without
regard to race, color, national origin, etc.

In addition to the above referenced service planning considerations, RTD Service Planning
staff works closely with RTD Finance to ensure that service adjustments reflect the
financial realities of the organization.
The consideration of these issues provides a systematic, objective and rational framework
within which RTD staff can evaluate potential changes in services in order to maximize
ridership and optimize the use of RTD’s resources.
In many ways, “service standards” could also be referred to as “expectations” as they
reflect what RTD’s performance expectations are in terms of ridership and subsidy for a
service (route) to be considered successful. The purpose of the standards is to help
identify routes that are most in need of service changes in order to maximize ridership and
optimize the use of RTD’s resources.

Enclosure 2 – Page 4

Packet Pg. 10

Attachment: Enclosure 2 - Fiscal Sustainability Financial Plan (1929 : GM 2015 Tactical Plans from Strategic Planning Session)

2.1.c

In applying these standards, RTD’s guidelines call for routes falling below the lowest 10%
productivity threshold based on either subsidy per passenger boarding or passengers
boarding per service hour, or below the lowest 25% productivity threshold for both
measures, to be evaluated for marketing, revision, or as a last resort, possible elimination.
These are not the sole criteria as RTD’s service standards also take into account services
provided to areas of high transit dependency and RTD staff also considers the existence of
alternative transit services in a given area when developing service recommendations.
The process to implement service changes consists of:






RTD staff develops a set of initial service change recommendations for consideration;
RTD staff presents the initial recommendations to the Board of Directors and presents
these initial recommendations to the public for public comment;
RTD staff holds public meetings in areas throughout the District that would potentially
be impacted by the proposed changes;
RTD staff develops a final set of proposed service changes based on the initial
recommendations and potential modifications based on public comment, and;
RTD staff presents the final service change proposals to the Board of Directors for final
approval and/or modification by Board action.

The entire service change process usually takes a period of 3-4 months from the time of
the development of the initial service change proposal until the implementation of the
service adjustments.
In order to support the Board of Directors in their policy deliberations, staff provides
detailed ridership information, cost information and revenue information to help identify the
rationale behind service change recommendations. These recommendations are discussed
at both Operations/Customer Services Committee meetings and Board meetings. Staff
also presents annual service evaluation reports to the Board of Directors to help
communicate the performance of the various services provided by RTD. Staff also stands
prepared to assist with the conduct of any workshops/study sessions on this topic that
might be desired by the Board of Directors.
Plan and Next Steps
Staff will continue to work with the Board to develop and present appropriate service
adjustments to the Board according to the schedule presented above for fixed-route, Light
Rail and general public paratransit services. Staff may deviate from the above schedule in
recommending changes to paratransit services provided for individuals with disabilities as
these services do not exhibit the same general seasonal variations as fixed route services.

Enclosure 2 – Page 5

2.1.c



In the fixed route bus service arena, in addition to employing the service planning
principles outlined above, staff will continue to focus resources on addressing issues
with on-time performance that have been identified since the implementation of the
January 2012 service adjustments made as part of the organization’s service
optimization efforts. Service planning efforts will also focus on any adjustments that
may appear appropriate as a result of the 2013 introduction of the West Rail Line and
associated bus service adjustments. These efforts will continue to ensure that RTD
services are “right-sized” given our financial resources.



In the Light Rail arena, staff will continue to focus on less productive LRT services that
might be eliminated, reduced or modified in order to take advantage of less expensive
service delivery modes and to work with Service Planning to provide improved time
periods for maintenance of way activities necessary for maintaining a state of good
repair of the Light Rail system. These less productive services may include late night
and early morning services during off-peak or non-service hours; these activities include
safety-critical, mandated system inspections and repair. Improved time periods will
allow these activities to occur more efficiently and with greater safety for employees
performing the work and will improve service reliability for our riding public. We will
also look at the advantages/disadvantages of shutting down whole sections of the
system during low-use hours so that work can be performed more efficiently while
trains are not present.



In addition, RTD staff from the Planning, Capital Programs, Rail Operations, and Service
Development groups will work to identify strategic capital infrastructure projects, such
as storage tracks, etc., that will result in operational cost savings for the expected life
of the rail operations. When such Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cost savings are
sufficient to offset expected capital costs, such improvements should be seriously
evaluated in order to address the long-term fiscal sustainability of the LRT operations
versus the one-time capital cost.



In 2015, staff also will be planning service for the US 36 BRT, I-225 Light Rail, and the
East, Gold, and Northwest Electrified Commuter Rail projects scheduled to open in
2016. We will develop service plans for each corridor, and adjust existing bus service
to provide feeder service to the new corridors. This will include optimizing rail and bus
service levels in the corridors to serve current and new riders in a cost-effective
manner.



In the ADA paratransit arena, RTD staff will continue to address Board concerns over
the cost and quality of ADA complementary paratransit service provided in accordance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Staff would offer the
following plan of action to continue to address these issues:



Staff is in the process of implementing Interactive Voice response (IVR) technology to
improve customer service and better manage customer cancellations and no-shows.
Features include:
- where’s my ride?
- automated call back function
- automated booking for Access-a-Cab
- automated vehicle arrival notices
- automated outbound announcements
- automated trip confirmations









Reduction in the number of service providers from 4 to 3 for Access-a-Ride services;
Introduction of “non-Dedicated” service provider vehicles through expanded use of
cabs outside of the Access-a-Cab program;
Continued expansion of the Access-a-Cab program;
Possible shift of late night/ weekend trips to non-dedicated vehicles;
Continue process of specifying pick-up and drop-off locations;
Continue evaluation of fleet vehicle mix (size and type of vehicles); and
Continue to evaluate service coordination between services/providers.

Demand Management Initiatives:



Coordination with Call-n-Ride and other service providers; and
Travel training to educate individuals with disabilities how to better use fixed-route
service.

RTD previously contracted with four service providers to provide Access-a-Ride service;
MV Transportation, CUSA Transportation Services, Global Transportation and Via Mobility
Services (formerly Special Transit of Boulder County). These contracts expired March 31,
2014 and effective April 1, 2014 RTD will contract with three (3) service providers and
one cab company to provide Access-a-Ride service.
In addition to Access-a-Ride service, in March 1997, RTD introduced the Access-a-Cab
program to certified Access-a-Ride clients. This program offers flexibility in transportation
services for individuals with disabilities. Individuals are permitted to schedule same day
trips via local cab companies. The passenger is responsible for the first $2.00 in cab fare.
RTD then subsidizes the next $12.00 in fare, with the passenger responsible for any
amount above that. The Access-a-Cab program has proven to be very popular and
continues to grow. Current Access-a-Cab ridership is over 500 trips per day and

Service Delivery Initiatives:

represents over 20% of total program ridership. This is more than four times the ridership
than in 2007 when RTD adjusted the user side subsidy from $7.00 to the current $12.00
to be effective in 2008. This service has allowed RTD to maintain essentially a constant
level of Access-a-Ride van service over the past five years while accommodating an
increase in overall program ridership and has allowed RTD to realize essentially a constant
level of subsidy per rider since 2008 (exclusive of fuel cost fluctuations).
In addition, RTD Rail Operations will obtain and put into service a Light Rail training
simulator to assist in the training and re-training of rail system employees. This simulator
will be located at the Elati Maintenance Facility and will allow us to instruct new operators
in a realistic operating environment without having to take a real train onto the main line,
which is already congested with in-service trains.
Students will operate the simulator
under instructor scrutiny and guidance before they take a real train out onto the system,
providing a safe, less-stressful training environment. This will also reduce LRV car-miles
and will reduce our traction power use.
Employee Retention
In 2009, bus operator retention averaged approximately 70%. Since that time, RTD has
identified a number of strategies to improve retention in all areas of RTD. Overall,
retention has dramatically improved (bus operators retention is now averaging around
90%; salaried workforce is averaging 97-98%). The following is a representative list of
the prior initiatives we have adopted to improve the employee work climate:




Expanded our outreach to strengthen diversity and inclusiveness; veterans; underemployed; unemployed
Created tools to ensure clear job expectations (e.g., “A Day in the Life of a Bus
Operator”)
Refreshed orientation process to be more welcoming and on-point
Strengthened internal career coaching and workshops to better prepare employees for
promotions
Enhanced career pathways to create greater awareness of growth opportunities within
RTD

Financial plan for cost effective service of asset age/debt load, plus remaining TABOR
capacity
RTD currently has a long-term financial plan that extends through the time horizon of the
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). This plan covers both FasTracks and the base system,
and includes initial construction of the FasTracks corridors, ongoing operations and
maintenance of bus and rail service and infrastructure, and major maintenance and
replacement of capital assets. During 2014, the time horizon of the plan will be extended
to 2040 to match the new time horizon of the RTP.
The model supporting the financial plan assumes funding levels for asset maintenance and
replacement based on the six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). After the time horizon of
the SBP, asset replacements are based on the age of the asset and the installed cost
escalated to current year dollars, and major maintenance allowances are based on a
percentage of the cost of the total installed asset base, escalated to current year dollars.
RTD will work to enhance the long-term financial plan through a variety of strategies:




Incorporating any potential innovative financing and revenue enhancements identified
through the innovative financing process
Adjusting future operating cost forecasts to incorporate service efficiencies identified
through the service development process
Identifying strategic capital infrastructure projects that will result in operational cost
savings for rail or bus operations, and incorporating these projects and the resulting
O&M cost savings into the long-term financial model

The Asset Management and State of Good Repair division will continue its primary work of
conducting annual asset condition assessments and preparing reports in accordance with
the RTD Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP) and FTA’s MAP-21 requirements. Asset

Demand Management Initiatives



Coordination with call-n-Ride and other service providers;
Travel training to educate individuals with disabilities how to better use fixed-route
service.

RTD previously contracted with four service providers to provide Access-a-Ride service;
MV Transportation, CUSA Transportation Services, Global Transportation and Via Mobility
Services (formerly Special Transit of Boulder County). These contracts expired March 31,
2014, and effective April 1, 2014, RTD began to contract with three (3) service providers
and one cab company to provide Access-a-Ride service.
In addition to Access-a-Ride service, in March 1997, RTD introduced the Access-a-Cab
program to certified Access-a-Ride clients. This program offers flexibility in transportation
services for individuals with disabilities. Individuals are permitted to schedule same day
trips via local cab companies. The passenger is responsible for the first $2.00 in cab fare.
RTD then subsidizes the next $12.00 in fare, with the passenger responsible for any
amount above that. The Access-a-Cab program has proven to be very popular and
continues to grow. Current access-a-Cab ridership is over 500 trips per day and represents

over 20% of total program ridership. This is more than four times the ridership than in
2007 when RTD adjusted the user side subsidy from $7.00 to the current $12.00 to be
effective in 2008. This service has allowed RTD to maintain essentially a constant level of
Access-a-Ride van service over the past five years while accommodating an increase in
overall program ridership.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2015
Strategic Goal #4
Implement Technological Advancements
Background
Technology is integral to the day-to-day and strategic operations of RTD. It is Information
Technology’s (IT) mission to work in partnership with the public and RTD business units to
provide innovative, effective, technology solutions that meet and advance RTD’s strategic
goals. IT strives to stay ahead of technological solutions the business units and the public
expect. To that end, several projects are planned for 2015 that will increase effectiveness
of RTD staff, improve services to our riders, and provide information to the RTD
management team that will enhance decision making. The strategic activities are
presented below in four investment areas:





Rider Focused
Operational Focused
Business Focused
IT Focused

RIDER FOCUSED
Providing riders with current and accurate information to enhance the rider’s experience is
a key area of investment in 2015. These efforts include:
Rider Facing Mobile Technologies
The use of mobile devices to consume information is continually increasing. In 2014,
access to RTD information using mobile devices surpassed access to information using a
desktop or laptop device. IT will continue to explore and offer information in formats
conducive to mobile consumption. This will be accomplished through mobile applications,
automated phone systems, and public signage.
Enhanced Traveler Information
Providing predictive information regarding arrival or departure times for buses will improve
rider’s experience. The first phase will include reporting the anticipated number of minutes
before a vehicle will arrive or depart from a certain stop or location and provide real time
information on the location of the vehicle.

Enclosure 4 – Page 1

Packet Pg. 22

Attachment: Enclosure 4 - Implement Technological Advancements (1929 : GM 2015 Tactical Plans from Strategic Planning Session)

2.1.e

2.1.e

IT will build and implement a new and improved Trip Planner application that will provide
trip planning information that is optimized for mobile devices. This will include providing
fare information about the planned trip. IT will also build a robust trip planning application
that matches the information being delivered to riders that will improve the operations and
efficiency of the customer contact center.
RTD-Denver.com Web Site
The existing RTD website will be migrated to Webcenter Sites. This will provide the
marketing department with the ability to publish content immediately, integrate social
media on the website, reduce the amount of static content, and provide the ability for
blogging and posting up-to-the minute information. The IT and the marketing team will
work together to add features and enhancements to the website. These enhancements will
improve retention and conversion of site visitors by targeting specific customer segments
with relevant recommendations and promotions. The enhanced Web experience will
improve customer loyalty, drive revenue, and increase campaign effectiveness.
OPERATIONS FOCUSED
Providing the technology tools to improve rider service, gain efficiencies and reduce cost is
a key focus for 2015. These efforts include:
Operations Facing Mobile Technologies
Bus and Rail Operations and Safety and Security are dependent on reliable voice and data
communications throughout the region. 2015 will see enhancements to the voice and data
communications network and additional functionality provided to the Bus and Rail
operational systems.
Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)
IT will work closely with Bus Dispatch to facilitate any minor changes and modifications
that might be recommended as this system matures. In addition, all fixed-route bus and
light rail vehicles will be equipped with Automatic Passenger Counting equipment. This will
provide a gateway to further application development for the light rail fleet.

Trip Planner

2.1.e

Changes to rail line maintenance commenced in 2014 requiring RTD to modify routes and
schedules. A temporary fix will be applied in 2014 to the programs that provide route
information. Additional changes to the programs in 2015 will allow for each day of the
week to stand alone as a separate schedule or service type. This will make it more
efficient for IT to make changes to schedules in the future and will decrease the amount of
time and effort needed to make the changes. Some of these changes will include adapting
and customizing the TIES application for Dispatch, Sign-out, Contact Center, Bus and Light
Rail Operations, Service Planning and Scheduling, including customizing delivery of
schedule information for the Web, PIDS, IVR/Text, and mobile. In addition, the scheduling
program used by RTD called Trapeze, will be undergoing an upgrade in 2015.
SmartDrive
Implementing Smart Drives on buses will help improve driver safety and performance. This
is an ongoing effort that may continue into 2016. Smart Drive is a simple camera system
designed to capture 20 seconds of video and other vehicle data surrounding an accident. It
is being installed on RTD operated vehicles by the bus maintenance group and will be
maintained by IT’s Mobile Technologies Group. IT is also providing resources for the
collection of data in the garages via WiFi. There is a potential this project may continue
into 2016.
Electronic Fare/SmartCard
The SmartCard program went live in 2013 with deployment of over 300,000 EcoPass and
College Pass cards and over 100 platform validators. This technology provides riders with
an electronic media card they use to tap on to the bus or rail. It also provides RTD
management with information about ridership. Continued enhancements and additional
functionality include:


Replace Handheld Smart Media Readers

The Handheld Smart Media Readers will be replaced in 2015 due to aging technology.
Additionally, the current devices are large and difficult to hold. Replacing the handhelds
will increase adoption of use by fare inspectors and provide more security should the
device be lost or stolen.

Addition of 4th Service Type for Rail

2.1.e

Provide Wireless Connectivity for Handheld Smart Media Readers

Today, handheld devices must be placed in their cradles in order to receive daily updates.
This is inefficient and requires additional steps by the fare inspectors. Incorporating
wireless updates on the handheld devices will improve the frequency of updates, improve
the ability to maintain the devices on the most current software release, and make it easier
for fare inspectors to perform the updates.


MyRide

Much like a debit card, the MyRide program allows the use of a “Stored Value” on a card
to pay for a trip. The cost of that trip is debited against the prepaid card. This reduces the
product costs of the various fare programs and provides a service to the rider. The pilot for
this complex and major deployment is anticipated in 2015.
BUSINESS FOCUSED
RTD maintains and advances the use of technology to conduct its business more
efficiently and effectively. There are several technology tools that are being applied in
2015 to this end. These efforts will include:
Business Intelligence
Business intelligence was implemented in 2014 with a limited, “out of the box” approach
providing dashboards and high level financial information to the RTD senior leadership
team. IT will work with the business units to further develop and take advantage of
collecting and reporting on data from across the enterprise.


Financial, Operations, and Ridership Data

Expand RTD’s business intelligence implementation to provide analysis, performance
management, benchmarking, predictive analysis, forecasting, ridership, day-to-day
operations, project accounting, and other analytics that will drive business value and
decision making. This will improve access to data for RTD management across the
organization.


State of Good Repair

Continue to improve data collection, analysis, statistics, and reporting of information for
the State of Good Repair program.

Enclosure 4 – Page 4

Packet Pg. 25

Attachment: Enclosure 4 - Implement Technological Advancements (1929 : GM 2015 Tactical Plans from Strategic Planning Session)



2.1.e

SmartCard Reporting

IT will build on and expand the existing SmartCard analytics to provide information that
will improve and sustain the day-to-day operations of the SmartCard program, enhance
fraud detection and analysis, and build and improve analytics for enforcement of smart
media usage and tracking.
Operator Self-Service Portal
Enhance operations and driver efficiency by improving the capabilities of the Operator selfservice portal. The portal provides information such as extra board assignments, shift
information, run numbers, headways, and more.
IT FOCUSED
In many respects, in government and business, IT is considered a utility that isn’t thought
about until there are no lights or dial-tone. RTD’s business depends on reliable and
accurate systems for accounting, inventory control, human resources, payroll, email,
procurement, communications, and more. This requires a significant investment in
infrastructure including items such as: data centers, servers, networks, desktops,
databases, applications, etc. 2015 efforts with an IT focus will include:
Cloud Technology
In 2015, IT will develop a roadmap on the strategic use of the Cloud to provide improved
systems and functionality at less cost to RTD. The actual implementation will take a
number of years.
Data Network
IT will implement corporate network upgrades that provide a solid and reliable
technological foundation for all RTD systems.
Cybersecurity
Data and information security is an ongoing challenge. IT will build information security
controls and awareness into our business processes to protect RTD systems’ integrity and
availability, and ridership information. Our approach considers both regulatory compliance
and information security. We will integrate regulatory requirements and best-of-breed
industry best practices into our operating policies, processes, procedures, and training. We
will also deploy technology that provides greater visibility to security-related system



information and events, devise processes to monitor, analyze, and manage that data on a
regular basis, and implement appropriate technical defenses against malicious activities.
Operations and Maintenance
Nearly 70% of all technology investments go toward keeping-the-lights-on. RTD is no
different. In 2015 there will be continued attention to technology operations, sustainable
activities, ongoing maintenance, support, and upgrades of mission critical systems.
Service Delivery
IT will continue to advance and mature the total quality management program that is
improving IT service delivery in several areas including service desk and desktop support.
Service Level Agreements will be developed with each business unit to set availability and
reliability standards. These standards will be monitored and measured using agreed upon
performance metrics.
Enterprise Content Management

In 2014, RTD will begin a comprehensive review of its Enterprise Content Management
systems. This entails reviewing the current systems, outlining a district-wide taxonomy to
ensure compatibility across all systems, and developing a governance process and policies
regarding enterprise content management storage and retention. In 2015 and beyond,
efforts will focus on further defining taxonomy, approving and enforcing governance
procedures and policies, consolidating content, and defining and implementing retention
policies.
