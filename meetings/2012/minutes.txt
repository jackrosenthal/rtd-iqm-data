I. Call To Order
Chair Kemp called the Study Session meeting to order at 5:30p.m.
II. Salaried Employees Benefits Trust Fund Update
Terry Bright of Rael & Letson explained that this salary plan was closed to
participants on January 1, 2008 and the total participant count decreased
from 764 to 753 last year. From an actuarial perspective, liabilities decreased
and a s s e t s increased. The c o n t r i b u t i o n r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s have
also b e e n reduced a full point fr om 11.8 % to 10.8 %. In addition, several
changes were made to the plan which decreased the liability rate from 8% to
7.5%. As of January 1st 2011, t h i s plan was 99.1% f u n d e d . From
a longer term perspective, this p l a n is onl y p r o j e c t e d to be solvent for 2 7
y e a r s . Benefit improvements will need to be made to continue this plan
past 2038. The current contribution requirement of 9% is somewhat
problematic and we would recommend replacing the current contribution
percentage rate with a dollar maximum.
Chair Kemp added that part of the Pension-Trust committee was to add middle

management. One of those individuals, Greg Yates, will be retiring in April. We
will reach out to middle management for applicants. The evaluation committee
will be comprised of the Chairman of the Board, Chair of the Salary Employee
Benefits Trust and the Chair of the Finance Committee.
Ill. Re-Districting
Director Hoy i n d i c a t e d that t h i s h a s b e e n a great p r o c e s s . Thank
y o u t o Director McMullen and a l l o f t h e other Directors for their
patience. The process included Bill Van Meter, Bill Sirois, Chris Quinn, Fred
Easton and Paula Perdue.
Chris Quinn explained that f oll owi ng the decennial census RTD is required to reevaluate boundaries to ensure the populations are generally even
throughout t h e district. General parameters outlined by the committee
included whole vote voter precincts and only a 5% variation from the mean
population of 178,000. The committee also tried to follow jurisdictional lines
whenever possible and to keep communities of interest together including
specific neighborhoods and business districts. The reapportionment must b e
approved by the Board by March 15 th.
Director McMullen a dd e d t h a t there are s o m e o d d enclaves due t o
the different p r e c i n c t s and we worked hard to keep communities intact.

IV. Other Matters
Director Bagley indicated that since there are significant discussions about the
Northwest Corridor and cost changes over time, the Board should be provided
the initial cost estimates and information on what has made the costs
increase.
Director Tayer noted that Bob Greenly referenced a figure of $280 Million and
indicated that it would be nice to know where that number came from.
Chair Kemp added that he attended Representative Mi c aâ€™s tour of a commuter
rail in Miami. There is a new transportation bill approaching the House which
would allot $250 Million every year for 5 years to the transportation industry.
Also, Representative Mica was very supportive of our own projects here in
Denver.
V. Adjournment
The Study Session adjourned at 6:10p.m.
