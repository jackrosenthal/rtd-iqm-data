BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 3, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Board Meeting Date: July 9, 2013

Subject:

2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
The SBP provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2014-2019 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2014-2019 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2013 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
July 9th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on July 16th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2013 Amended Budget. The column titled “Amended Budget 2013” in Exhibit I incorporates
revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School, and reductions, eliminations or deferrals of
SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $113.7 million in 2014 is forecast to decrease by $2.4 million
from 2013 due to transfer of revenue (and ridership) from bus to the West
Line. This represents ridership revenue that West Line has gained and bus has
lost. In future years, fare revenue includes a 10% farebox rate increase in
2015 and 2017 per Board policy of an optional 10% fare rate increase every 3
years.
 Sales and use tax incorporates the June quarterly update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2013-2019.
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
recent congressional actions.
 Fixed guideway and capital maintenance grant revenue is increased at the area
CPI inflation rates (from the CLC) with a doubling of fixed guideway grant
revenue (additional $8.7 million) in 2014 resulting from the seven-year
operating anniversary of the Southeast corridor.
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates of 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in
2015-2019. Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated
amount through 2017 then escalated at the CPI rate.
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base
System, will be held at the 2013 level in 2014, and beginning with 2014 increased
by the CPI rate serially each year.
 Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects are included (Exhibit III).
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in
investable balances.
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each
year by using amortization tables. Projected interest payments on future debt issues
are based on current municipal rate forward curves. Interest payment assumptions
incorporate recent upticks in interest rates on the forward curve.
 Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects
and replacements (Exhibit II).
 Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund, staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and/or capital
replacement fund be maintained at a minimum $3.0 million each year until each fund
reaches the minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur no later than
2019. During 2017, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to reach
$30 million.
 Contributions to fund balances include the Base System’s FISA contribution from sale
of Civic Center air rights.
 Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition. Debt
payments are derived from debt amortization schedules.
 Non-cash items include the estimated year-end net pension obligation offset by yearend accruals.

Note: The CLC inflation rate (CPI) is 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in 2015-2019, while the national CPI (applied
to fuel) is 2.5% in 2014-2019.

Exhibit II
Exhibit II is a detailed listing of planned capital projects during the SBP period. Copies are available
in the Board office for review.
Exhibit III
Exhibit III is a detailed listing of planned operating, maintenance and administrative projects during
the SBP period. Copies are available in the Board office for review.
Exhibit IV
Exhibit IV is a listing of deferred capital and operating projects that were submitted for
consideration during the SBP development process but are excluded from the 2014-2019 SBP at
this time. Copies are available in the Board office for review.
The planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI rate starting in
2014 (in millions).

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax
revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an
impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2014
budget period.
Current key financial indicators for the SBP are (in millions):

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2014-2019 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2014-2019 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2014 budget

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2014 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2014-2019
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2014 budget process.

Per the U.S. Department of Transportation guidance and regulations, all recipients
of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 •and its related laws and regulations. As a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) submits an annual assurance
of compliance with Title VI as a part of RTD’s annual submission of Certifications
and Assurances, as required per 49 CFR part 21.7. Accordingly, RTD’s Planning
Department will review the district’s services in its entirety for compliance with
Title VI. This review will include a review of the Strategic Budget Plan as
necessary, pursuant to ensuring non-discrimination on basis of race, color and
national origin. Should any Title VI violations become evident, remedial and/or
mitigating measures will be developed to restore equity and achieve compliance
with Title VI.
