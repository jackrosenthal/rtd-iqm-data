#### 1. 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to move the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) to the full Board for adoption.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Jannette Scarpino explained that the development of the SBP has been discussed in several committee meetings beginning in March of 2013.  Two previous drafts were presented with their initial and early assumptions. They have been able to sharpen the estimates after gathering more information. They are now recommending approval of a final SBP. Jannette Scarpino reiterated that this is a balanced SPB; balanced means there is a positive unrestricted year end fund balance over the 6-year period. Staff has incorporated the CU Leeds sales tax forecast updated in June. The revised growth projection for 2013 is 3.7%, which is up from 2.5% in the March forecast.

Jannette Scarpino reviewed Exhibit 1 (available online as page 7 in the Agenda Packet).  She stated there are no service reductions being proposed in the SBP. She explained staff is showing a fare revenue decrease of 2% in 2014 but this is really just a transfer of base operations revenue to the West line.  The SBP show a fare revenue to increase 10% every third year per Board policy.

Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that she spoke about project requests in previous meetings and the project requests have been reduced, eliminated or deferred to the tune of about $185 million, which has helped balance the SBP. The deferred projects which they would like to bring back into the SBP at some point now total $13.7 million. A list of deferred projects is contained in Exhibit 4 which is available in the Board office for review. A list of planned projects is shown in Exhibits 2 and 3 (also in the Board office).

Jannette Scarpino stated that the Board-appropriated fund and the capital replacement fund are funded at the minimum of $3 million per year, to a target of $30 million for each fund. This is per policy and provides a basis for fiscal sustainability. She said the target balances are reached no later than 2019. Also in 2019, the unrestricted year end fund balance is projected to reach $95.1 million. There will be factors outside of staff control, such as sales tax revenue, fuel, cost of materials, inflation, economic conditions, etc., which will impact the SBP, but they will attempt to address those factors in developing the 2014 budget.

Director Folska requested to be able to review Exhibits 2, 3 and 4 mentioned in the presentation just given when she was reviewing the entire Board packet.  She also asked whether this would be the right time to ask about the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). Jannette Scarpino assured Director Folska she would investigate the possibility of providing a link to the Exhibits. GM Washington stated that Bill Van Meter would address the TIP later.

Director Deadwyler inquired about the fare decreases and increases she heard mentioned in the report. GM Washington explained that there would be a fare revenue decrease, not a fare decrease, in relation to the 2% in 2014. Jannette Scarpino further elaborated the 2% fare revenue decrease would occur in 2014 as a result of the West line coming on and “cannibalizing” fare revenue that otherwise would have gone to Bus. The fare revenue will still be collected but will be reported in FasTracks operations, which is the West line. Then in 2015 and 2017, they are programming in a fare increase of 10%, per Board policy. The Board has the opportunity to consider a fare increase every 3 years. GM Washington stated that 2015 will be the year in which the Board will consider a fare increase, per Board policy. Director Deadwyler commented that this explanation is very helpful.  She has been approached by many transit-dependent citizens concerned about fare increases. She thanked Jannette Scarpino and GM Washington for the clarification.

Director Walker commented that we will be bringing a few other rail lines on board in 2016 and 2017 but he doesn’t see a fare revenue decrease in 2017.  He wonders if it is too far out to estimate.  Jannette Scarpino said this is a good point; it is difficult to estimate right now, so they have opted to not include it in the SBP. By that time, largely due to sales tax increase, staff will be able to generate substantially more unrestricted fund balances in those years, so there is a cushion.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. Final 2014-2019 SBP-Exhibit I

##### b. Title VI statement

#### 1. May 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, provided the Board with a status report.  RTD ridership is up 4.7%, or 398,000 riders; this is mainly due to the 373,000 additional riders we gained with the West line. For the year we are still down 1.2%, or 515,000 riders. That is actually an improvement over April.  With the additional ridership that we got from the West line May actually wash with the extra day that we had in 2012; we are basically flat to 2012. He pointed out that in the ridership section, staff has added a line (the second line down) for the West line and will be report that separately because it is FasTracks operations. At this time ridership is about where we expected it be at about 13,000 on a weekday. Doug MacLeod believes that should ramp up to about 18,000 eventually.

Doug MacLeod stated that fare revenue is up 10.7%, or $1,044,000, for the month of May over May 2012. Year-to-date through May of 2013 we are up $1,854,000, or 3.9%. He explained that the revenue from RTD’s fare boxes was actually down half a percent, or $13,000 but the overall increase is coming from our passes -- EcoPasses, CollegePasses, monthly passes and annual passes.  These increases are due to the federal workers shifting over to flex-pass and out of the discounted EcoPass, as well as annual increases that we have in contracts for the CollegePasses and EcoPasses.

Doug MacLeod explained that the Sales and Use Tax numbers reported were an estimate; he informed the Board he left a copy of the revised/actual sales tax numbers at each Director’s place at the table. For the month of May, we were actually up 6.3% compared to May 2012, so that was additional $2,385,000 this May. Year-to-date we are up 2.3%. In April, we were down eight-tenths of a percent, so that’s a big swing the other way.  The main contributors to that increase in May came from a few different industries including new and used car sales, home improvement centers, liquor stores’ sales, and computer manufacturing.

Doug MacLeod stated that page 17 of the Agenda Packet shows RTD’s operating results for the West line for the month of May in addition to the start-up costs for the year-to-date. He explained that staff is tracking the cost of FasTracks operations with an allocation cost model; the reason staff uses this model is because they cannot separate out all the West line specific costs from the costs for the rest of the system. Each one of those costs has been allocated to the West line on an activity-based approach; for instance, they would allocate maintenance costs on track miles or revenue hours. He stated that staff will follow this methodology throughout the year and then true it up. He does not anticipate any big adjustments.  Doug MacLeod pointed out that the year-to-date column includes both start-up expenses through April and operating expenses; going forward, it will only be operating expenses.

Director Folska thanked Doug MacLeod for the update and requested clarification on whether a rail line continues to be in FasTracks once it has been opened or if it gets moved into our base system operating budget.  Doug MacLeod replied that we have to keep the six-tenths sales tax separate from the four-tenths sales tax for FasTracks so the West line becomes part of FasTracks operations; FasTracks operations is separate from FasTracks capital programs. Director Folska asked whether the FasTracks operations accounts for 5% or 20% of the bus fare revenue. Doug MacLeod responded that when staff sets the budget for FasTracks operations versus base system operations, they look at certain costs that cannot be separated out; for instance, maintenance costs. There is not a separate maintenance support function for the FasTracks operations so staff looks at the individual item and determines how much will be used by FasTracks and the rest stays on the base system side. Director Folska thanked Doug MacLeod for the clarification.

Director Hoy stated that his understanding is that this allocation has to do with West line trains sharing tracks with base system trains.  Doug MacLeod confirmed this was true.

Director Sisk commented that there doesn’t seem to be an allocation for general counsel and safety and security.  He asked if those allocations would always be zero.  Doug MacLeod replied that there is actually an allocation for safety and security, but he understands Director Sisk’s point that there are some zeroes. He explained that their cost allocation model has been used for a long time. It was used in the past for our national transit database report to the federal government and also to do our internal allocation to the FasTracks operations. When it comes to some support costs like legal counsel, RTD would have those costs whether or not the West line existed.  Marla Lien added that when the FasTracks capital program was developed, a staffing plan was put together with all the staff necessary to implement the program that are paid out of the FasTracks capital budget. She said that we have not yet made an assessment of the staff allocation and the way we do the budget but we could in the near future now that we have FasTracks operations.  Director Sisk believes that would be good. GM Washington stated that one of the things to think about as well is that a lot of the positions that we brought on which are funded by FasTracks capital budget are project positions as well. He stated that some of those positions will theoretically go away when the capital portion is complete.
