BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 24, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors to reappoint three current members of
the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee to an additional three-year term and appoint three new members
to the Committee to three-year terms.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is comprised of residents
from around the region. Members are appointed by the RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time
to advise the agency on a range of transit issues that affects citizens, as well as impact the region.
The recruitment strategy used to solicit candidates included publicly advertisements through the RTD
website, local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to submit an
application explaining why they wanted to serve on the CAC; describing what unique experience and
skillset they would bring; listing affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add value; and
providing a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC membership.
A total of 22 individuals submitted applications for six CAC seats. Five current members’ terms expired
on July 31, 2021. Two are ineligible for reappointment, and three have requested a reappointment. One
additional vacancy is due to a former member moving out of the district.
DISCUSSION
The CAC Nominating Committee reviewed factors related to current members seeking reappointment
such as attendance, participation at meetings and maintaining Committee consistency and recommends
reappointment of the three current members who requested reappointment. The Nominating Committee
then carefully reviewed all applications for new membership to fill the three remaining positions and held
interviews with several finalists.
The following current members are recommended for reappointment to an additional three-year term
expiring July 31, 2026:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Bridge Inspections On-Call Services Contract
Change

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 24, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to increase the oncall bridge inspection contract with Alfred Benesch & Co. by $600,000 for a total amount not to exceed
$2,160,900.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD contracts for inspection services for all its 109 bridges, including light rail, pedestrian, commuter
rail and Amtrak bridges; as well as 14 freight rail bridges along the Southwest Corridor through
agreements made with the railroads during construction.
The current on-call bridge inspection contract is held by Alfred Benesch and Co. (Benesch) which was
awarded on August 25, 2017. The initial contract was for three years, plus two, one-year options. All
the options have been exercised. The current contract is set to expire on August 25, 2022, at which
time staff will solicit proposals for bridge inspection services. Over the five-year contract span, three
new rail corridors opened and required inclusion in the agency’s bridge inspection program. Thus, the
original contract value will be exceeded before the inspections are completed.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the contract value be increased at this time, which will allow Benesch to perform
the 2022 bridge inspections, prior to the contract expiration date. This will allow continuity of
inspections and processes under the current program.
Staff is currently updating the current bridge management program for compliance with recent Safety
Management System and Transit Asset Management requirements. These additional requirements
would be ready for inclusion into RTD’s bridge management program in the second quarter of 2022.
Contingent upon completion of the bridge management program, staff anticipates soliciting for a fiveyear inspection contract.
FINANCIAL AND OTHER IMPACTS
Bridge inspections are budgeted annually as an operating expense line item. Funding for this contract
change will be included within the expense budget request for 2022.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail, RTD and
CDOT Commission Cooperation Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 24, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to execute the Cooperation
Agreement between Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission and Regional
Transportation District and Colorado Department of Transportation for Accomplishment of Shared Goals
(Cooperation Agreement).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In a February 2021 meeting with the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Southwest Chief and Front Range
Passenger Rail Commission (Commission), the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) raised the possibility
of entering into an agreement between RTD and the Commission.
As discussed, the agreement would formalize the intent of both parties to work collaboratively in the
preliminary operations planning and related activities, including outreach and design, for passenger rail
service along the Northwest Rail Alignment in concert with the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study.
Subsequent discussions with the Commission and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
led to mutual agreement to add CDOT as a signatory to the agreement as CDOT has an established
working relationship providing staff time in support of the Commission.
Through March and April 2021, staff from the three parties collaborated in the preparation of a draft
Cooperation Agreement and on April 22, 2021, the GM/CEO provided the Board a first draft of the
proposed Cooperation Agreement for review and comment. The Commission and CDOT have also had
the opportunity to review and provide input throughout the development process.
Concurrently, the Commission and CDOT have been jointly pursuing development of a scope of work for
a federal grant-funded Service Development Plan (SDP) for Front Range passenger rail, with the
Northwest Rail Corridor identified as one potential alignment in the northern Denver metro area. The SDP
will outline a business plan, operating plan, and capital plan and investment case for a proposed
Passenger Rail service. This includes an evaluation of operation feasibility, financial feasibility and overall
value and merit of the proposed service.
On June 30, 2021, Governor Polis signed Senate Bill 21-238, creating the Front Range Passenger Rail
District (District). Per this legislation, the Commission will be terminated effective February 15, 2022
with the District effectively acting as the successor to the Commission. The District will hold its first
meeting no later than May 15, 2022.

operating and maintaining a passenger rail system. The District is also authorized to exercise powers
related to these purposes, including the ability to propose taxes, subject to voter approval, to fund a
front range passenger rail system.
Following review, edits and comment resolution by representatives of the legal teams for RTD and
CDOT, the Cooperation Agreement is ready for Board consideration and execution.
DISCUSSION
The Cooperation Agreement formalizes a cooperative partnership on behalf of the parties to work
towards completing a unified, single preliminary operations plan for passenger rail service along the
Northwest Rail Alignment, consistent with the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study and the
Commission/CDOT-sponsored Front Range Service Development Plan. The Cooperation Agreement
identifies opportunities for cooperation in planning, stakeholder engagement and public involvement,
media relations, legislative and policy development, budget and funding, staffing and oversight and
management.
Although the Commission will be superseded in early 2022 by the District, all parties agree in principle
that the execution of this Cooperation Agreement will be of value in the interim. Additionally, the
cooperation agreement sets a strong template for a potential future agreement between RTD, CDOT and
the District, which is also consistent with the intent of Senate Bill 21-238, in that the bill specifically
requires the District to work collaboratively with RTD to ensure interconnectivity with any passenger rail
system operated by or for RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Refinance Lease Purchase Agreements for Interest Savings

Committee Meeting Date:
August 17, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 24, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to adopt Resolution Number __, Series 2021 (the “Resolution”), to
amend the 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA to realize
interest rate savings.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2016, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) entered into a lease purchase agreement involving JP
Morgan Chase Bank, NA, to refinance previously outstanding certificates of participation (COPs) in order
to obtain lower interest rates. The 2016 lease purchase agreement has an approximate $25.7 million
balance remaining to be paid and is part of RTD’s Base System. The 2016 lease purchase agreement
may be prepaid at any time and the final payment is scheduled for 2022.
In 2017, RTD entered into a lease purchase agreement involving JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, to
refinance previously outstanding COPs in order to obtain lower interest rates. Approximately $152.5
million ($109.2 million Base System and $43.3 million FasTracks) of this lease purchase agreement
remains to be paid. The 2017 lease purchase agreement may be prepaid at any time and the final
payment is scheduled for 2025.
These 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements refinanced the COPs that were issued to purchase
light rail vehicles and buses.
DISCUSSION
RTD approached JP Morgan Chase Bank regarding the 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements due
to the current low interest rate environment and the potential interest rate savings to be realized by
RTD if both parties agreed to amend the agreements. JP Morgan Chase Bank was very interested in
amending the lease purchase agreements and offered competitive interest rates and terms that were
better than the District could obtain through the sale of refinancing COPs in the marketplace.
Amending the existing leases is also less expensive than the alternatives as RTD will incur minimal
legal fees, and not incur any rating agency fees or bank underwriting fees.
The Resolution allows for the refinancing of the 2016 and 2017 lease purchase agreements (the
“Leases”) for interest savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the refinancings
are identified in the Resolution and include:

•

First Amendment to 2016 Lease Purchase Agreement
First Amendment to 2017 Lease Purchase Agreement
Resolution of RTD to amend the Lease Purchase Agreements

The Resolution delegates to the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer the authority to accept a
proposal from JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, for a reduced rate of interest on the Leases provided that the
rate of interest must be lower than the interest rate currently in the Leases.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisor and Butler Snow LLP as
bond counsel regarding this transaction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Current market conditions could create savings to RTD of approximately $4 million between 2021 and
2025 (2.6% net present value savings). This is below the 3% minimum savings identified in the RTD
Fiscal Policy, however, given the short-term nature of these Leases and low cost to execute the
transaction, the savings is appropriate. Costs of the refinancing would include legal fees and are
expected to be less than $5,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
29th and Welton Property Disposition

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 24, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and/or her designee to negotiate and
execute all documents necessary for the disposition by lease or sale of the real property located at
2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds,
covenants, and other property conveyance documents.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Transit-Oriented Development Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the Equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) Policy, approved by the Board
in February 2021, as well as the policy goals of Resolution 17, Series of 2010, the Strategic Plan for
Transit-Oriented Development, by supporting creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD acquired the Property located at the corner of 29th Street and Welton Street for $97,000 in 1993
to replace the on-street parking for local businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central
Corridor. The Property is currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not
managed as part of RTD’s parking management system.
In 2010, the Board adopted the Strategic Plan for TOD to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementation of the new Strategic Plan for TOD. Pursuant to
that policy direction, RTD selected the Welton Corridor as one of four Pilot Program sites because of a
combination of favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s
(CCD) commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor, a commitment that continues today.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor, including activation of the
Property. The plan emphasized the need to retain housing affordability in the Welton Corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED) began discussions
around how to partner to implement the community vision established in the Five Points Business
District plan as part of the RTD Pilot Program implementation. CCD determined that attainable for-sale
housing was the preferred strategy for the site.
In December 2016, the Board approved an option agreement for CCD or its assignee to purchase the
Property at fair market value, for the development of mixed-income housing. The exercise of the option
was contingent on the mutual selection of a development partner. A developer was selected in
December 2017 but could not secure adequate financing, prompting RTD and CCD to dismiss the

Packet Pg. 67

13.E

developer and the project in January 2020 prior to closing. Later in 2020, the Board affirmed its
preference to ground-lease, rather than sell, this property for redevelopment. The Property was appraised
in January 2020 at $2.4 million. In 2021, the Board approved a resolution committed to promoting
affordable housing as detailed in the agency’s eTOD Policy.
RTD and CCD have outlined a competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixed-income
condominium project with affordable units on the Property. RTD would lead the Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) process and CCD would participate in the developer selection panel and provide gap
financing for the project. A letter from Denver Mayor Michael Hancock expressing CCD’s commitment to
this project is attached to the Board packet. It describes CCD’s willingness to contribute substantial gap
financing to support an appropriate development on the Property.
To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD must establish certainty for potential
bidders that the property will be available at previously agreed upon terms. Therefore, staff has
requested authority to dispose of the Property according to the terms below.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to dispose of the Property to the selected developer conditioned upon
meeting the following requirements:
1. RTD will successfully procure a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project with affordable units.
2. The selected developer will secure the financing necessary to complete the project.
3. The final lease or purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of
the Property with a potential for reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency pursuant to the eTOD Policy.
4. Lease signing or closing will occur a maximum of two years from the date of developer selection,
with the ability to grant two 90-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction.
5. RTD will grant property rights to the development partner via a ground lease rather than a sale
unless a ground lease structure is financially infeasible; or if a sale structure substantially
increases the quantity, depth, or length of the term of affordability; or a sale structure is
financially beneficial to RTD, as determined by RTD.
If a selected developer fails to complete the transaction, RTD would remain the property owner and any
subsequent decisions about the Property would be subject to Board approval. RTD staff will keep the
Board apprised of the developer selection process and project implementation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,500 per year maintaining the property. If the property is
disposed of, RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation and will receive the amount determined
by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.

To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve the disposition of RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton
Street for the development of mixed-income housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) and now the office of
Housing Stability (HOST) has been working closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented
Development team to plan for the development of mixed-income for-sale housing on this
site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on this joint effort to provide critical
affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Pointsneighborhood.
As part of HOST’s mission, we invest federal and local funds in the development and
preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, HOST
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, HOST invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Michael B. Hancock

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.

Response to Accountability Committee Recommendations

Committee Meeting Date:
August 17, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 24, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt responses to the recommendations outlined in the “RTD
Accountability Committee Final Report.”
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In collaboration with the Board of Directors, the Accountability Committee (Committee) was created in
July 2020 by Governor Jared Polis along with Representative Matt Gray and Senator Faith Winter, then
chairs of the Colorado General Assembly’s standing committees responsible for oversight of
transportation matters.
The purpose of the Committee was to provide an independent and objective analysis of RTD's
operations and to develop a set of recommendations for improvement to the operations and statutes
related to RTD. The Committee, comprised of legislative and gubernatorial appointees, two Ex-Officio
members from the RTD Board of Directors and supported by staff assistance from the Denver Regional
Council of Governments, established three subcommittees to facilitate discussions around three main
focal points: governance, finance, and operations.
The Committee held its first meeting on August 10, 2020 and met on a regular basis through its final
meeting on July 12, 2021. RTD Board members and staff attended and participated in the committee’s
meetings, as did General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson following her appointment and installation
in November 2020.
RTD received the committee’s final report on July 20, 2021, establishing September 3, 2021 as the
date by which RTD must respond to the recommendations contained in the report.
DISCUSSION
The Committee’s recommendations were divided into nine general subject matter areas, with related
individual recommendations grouped within the following headings:
• Spend Federal COVID-19 Relief Funds to Rebuild Ridership and Improve Operations
• Improve Operator Retention
• Develop Subregional Service Councils
• Explore Board Structure Modifications Subject to Additional Study and Input
• Explore FasTracks Options
• Improve Reporting Metrics and Transparency
• Improve Fixed-Route and Paratransit Service Provision
• Leverage Partnerships for Resources and Services

RTD staff has addressed each of the recommendations in the response, noting whether the agency
agrees, partially agrees, or disagrees with each of the 43 individual recommendations posed by the
Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
While implementation of the Committee’s recommendations will create budgetary impacts, there is no
direct fiscal impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

Final Report

13.F.a

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a vital part of the Denver region’s multimodal transportation
system connecting people to jobs; schools; shopping; medical care; cultural, sporting, and leisure
activities; and recreation. RTD helps reduce traffic congestion and transportation-related climate
emissions and air pollution – so important to the quality of the environment along the front range – and
provides an equitable mobility alternative for people who cannot afford, are unable, or choose not to drive.
RTD also allows for a degree of independence for so many residents and serves as an important
stimulant for the region’s economic development. Over the past 17 years, RTD has experienced
tremendous growth with the development of its FasTracks program – building 25.1 miles of light rail track
and 53 miles of commuter rail track, the launch of the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit service, and the
opening of an intermodal hub at Union Station in downtown Denver. Yet, the region’s transit system must
also increasingly address major trends, such as a rapidly growing population and employment base, new
technology, an evolving economy, changing residential and workplace preferences, and the equity
challenges associated with rapidly changing neighborhoods and historic disparities. RTD is also
experiencing lackluster ridership and financial challenges exacerbated by a heavy debt load and
unsustainable revenue outlook. The COVID-19 pandemic only added to these challenges, resulting in a
60 percent decrease in ridership for RTD.
Understanding the important role RTD plays in the success of the Denver region, in the summer of 2020,
Governor Polis and the transportation committee chairs of the Colorado General Assembly, in
collaboration with the RTD Board created the RTD Accountability Committee (the Committee). The
purpose of the Committee is to provide an independent and objective analysis of RTD's operations and
develop a set of recommendations for improvement to the operations and statutes related to RTD. The
Committee has undertaken an analysis of the Agency, studied many other similar transit agencies and is
pleased to present this RTD Accountability Committee Final Report outlining the nine areas of
recommendations proposed by the Committee:
•

disparate impact on any specific populations within the district. For each recommendation proposed, an Equity
have on residents across the region. This document also contains the results of those assessments.

Overview
In July of 2020, the Governor of Colorado and the Transportation Chairs of the General Assembly, in
collaboration with the Regional Transportation District (RTD, the District or the Agency) Board, chose to create
the RTD Accountability Committee (the Committee), a body fully independent from RTD. The Committee was
charged with providing feedback and a set of recommendations for improvement to RTD’s operations of and
statutes related to RTD. The Committee was appointed on July 15, 2020 and held its first meeting August 10,
2020. The Committee was tasked with issuing a report with recommendations to the Board and staff of RTD, the
Governor, the General Assembly, and the public no later than July 1, 2021. This document contains the
recommendations of the Committee and is respectfully submitted to the Governor, the chairs of the
transportation committees in the State Senate and House of Representatives, and the RTD Board of Directors.
The Committee consisted of eleven members, with five appointed by the Governor and six by the transportation
chairs of the House and Senate. Additionally, the RTD Board chair appointed two ex-officio members from the
RTD Board. Members were appointed for their expertise in local government, economic development, issues
facing transit riders with disabilities, human resources, transportation equity, financial planning and management,
and urban planning (Committee membership and areas of expertise can found on page 2 of this document).
The Committee was hosted and staffed by an independent agency, Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG). Support was provided by RTD and a third-party consultant with expertise in transit authority
operations, North Highland.
The Committee’s role is to provide recommendations for improvement to RTD; it has no authority to compel the
agency to implement them. However, within 45 days of the Committee issuing its final report, RTD is required to
either adopt the recommendations or issue a report stating its reasons for not adopting specific
recommendations. The Committee requests that RTD present its response and implementation timeline at an inperson meeting with Committee members, the Governor or his designee and the State Senate and House
Transportation Committee chairs. Further, the Committee believes that 12 months is an appropriate timeline for
RTD to implement its recommendations, recognizing that some improvements may take longer to complete than
others.

Responsibilities
The scope of the Committee’s work was broad and completely independent of RTD. Throughout the
Committee’s deliberations there were opportunities for the perspectives of RTD’s Board, staff, and the public at

•

A determination of the long-range financial stability of the Agency, and how the Agency can achieve stability
and growth while still meeting its core mission.

Ways of working
The Committee established focus areas aligned with its scope of work. Three Subcommittees focused on
Governance, Finance, and Operations were formed to ensure a thorough investigation of specific issues. Table 1
details the focus areas of each Subcommittee. Focus areas were not mutually exclusive and, when appropriate,
were addressed by one or more Subcommittees.

Committee was specifically focused, though not limited to, a review of the following:

Assess whether the size and
structure of RTD’s service area
is appropriate relative to its
ability to provide transit service.

Make recommendations on how
to improve financial transparency
to restore public trust and
demonstrate RTD accountability
to voters and policymakers, such
as the development of a public
online dashboard to show how
RTD money is generated and
spent.

Focus on proactive, communitybased transit service planning and
operations. Strengthen and
formalize coordination between
RTD and cities/counties with
development review/approval of
project and design of transit
service for key developments.

Assess whether the RTD Board
would be more effective with a
different size or structure.

Examine partnership opportunities
to enhance mobility services and
allow RTD to focus on delivering
the types of services it can do
most effectively and efficiently.

Undertake an overall
organizational assessment (HR,
work culture, and management
and governance of district and
Board organizational structure).

13.F.a

Table 1: Subcommittee Focus Areas

Meeting structure
Meetings of the full Committee were held monthly. Full Committee meetings provided an opportunity for
Subcommittee Chairs to provide status reports. The Full Committee also discussed, reviewed, and voted on any
recommendations or required actions. Voting required a quorum of two-thirds of the Committee, with a majority
vote to pass any motions brought before the Committee.
Subcommittee meetings were held twice a month. During Subcommittee meetings investigatory lines of
questioning were developed, subject matter experts shared their expertise on a given topic, potential solutions
were discussed and vetted, and recommendations drafted to share with the Full Committee for action.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all full Committee and Subcommittee meetings were held virtually. This
increased the accessibility and participation of these meetings through a meeting link made available on the
DRCOG website.

Public outreach
The Committee felt strongly that the public should be engaged at every opportunity. DRCOG developed a RTD
Accountability Committee webpage where all materials related to Committee activities was made available. The
webpage were maintained and updated by DRCOG. Content included the Committee Scope of Work, meeting
packets, and recordings. All meetings were open to the public virtually, with meeting materials distributed two
days prior.
To further engage the public, each meeting of the Full Committee allowed time for public comment. Comments
were responded to when appropriate, and the discourse was documented in the meeting minutes. Additionally,

the Committee provided a public comment period on its draft recommendations, including opportunities for
online survey was open from June 2 through June 15, 2021. In addition to capturing overall sentiment on the
recommendations, the survey allowed for open comment as well. A summary of the survey results and, the
public commentary was documented and is include in Appendix 1 of this report.

Equity Assessments
The Committee agreed that social, financial, and environmental equity should be at the forefront as it considered
and finalized recommendations. As a result, the Equity Assessment Mission Statement was adopted, which
ensures that an equity lens will be applied to the Committee’s recommendations to make certain that benefits are
shared across the RTD service area and that no one group bears a larger burden of environmental or financial
impact, especially communities of concern (including, but not limited to minority, low income, individuals with
disabilities, older adult, and veteran populations). A commitment was made for completing Equity Assessments
with each recommendation brought forward through the Committee. An assessment template was created by
DRCOG staff and approved by the Committee for this purpose. Initial assessments were completed by DRCOG
staff; however, to maintain full independence future Equity Assessments were conducted by Mile High Connects,
with involvement from other equity-focused community groups and leaders. A more thorough description of the
Equity Assessment methodology and resulting analyses can be found in Part 2 of this document.

Accomplishments
The Committee was able to achieve notable accomplishments prior to the submission of this final report. In
January, 2021 the Committee’s Preliminary Report was submitted to the Governor and General Assembly. The
Preliminary Report included specific proposed legislative recommendations adopted by the Committee for
consideration by the General Assembly, which were enacted in the 2021 Legislative Session. The legislative
recommendations were focused on statutory restrictions that, if modified or deleted, would allow RTD greater
flexibility and opportunity to improve finances and ridership. HB-1186 was passed by the legislature and was
formally signed into law by the Governor on May 24.
Throughout its analysis and investigation, the Committee confirmed the importance the RTD system and transit
in general has within the Denver metro region. As such, the Committee successfully collaborated to submit a
letter (Appendix 2) to Senators Winter and Fenberg and Representatives Gray and Garnett, sponsors of the draft
transportation funding proposal. The purpose of this letter was to encourage the legislature to provide more
investment in multimodal transportation options. The Committee received a response from the bill sponsors
indicating that funding would be expanded. Senate Bill 21-260 was ultimately enacted, providing $5 billion over
10 years to Colorado’s transportation system, including $800 million in multimodal funding.

13.F.a

Charged with reviewing recent financials from the district, including any recent audits, the Committee conducted
a thorough assessment of the Agency’s use of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES Act 1) in
partnership with the third-party consultant. Additional Federal funding opportunities were analyzed by the
Committee to determine where opportunity may exist to improve ridership and operations. The Committee also
reviewed and was briefed on a recent Performance Audit issued by the Office of the State Audit. Both topics are
discussed below.

COVID and Other Federal Stimulus Funds
RTD will receive more than $700 million in federal funds in 2020-21 related to recovery from the pandemic and
the related economic recession. The Committee reviewed RTD’s expenditure of the first tranche of this funding,
provided via the federal CARES Act, and made recommendations on how to spend all of this unanticipated
federal funding, with the goal of restoring transit service and attracting former and new transit riders.
RTD received approximately $232 million in federal CARES Act funding in 2020. Through service reductions and
other cost-cutting measures including furlough days for non-represented staff, travel and training reductions, and
deferred asset management projects, RTD was able to retain all employees during 2020 and add approximately
$80 million to reserve funds. The Committee reviewed RTD’s use of those funds with the following findings:
•

RTD utilized CARES funding in alignment with the earmarked intention for spending – to support operating
costs and employee salaries in the interest of avoiding layoffs. Funds were reimbursed by the federal
government for the following two expense types:

•

Represented and Non-Represented Wages and Benefits: Employee wages for both unionized and non-union
employees; roughly 64% of CARES funding drawn through September 2020.

•

Purchased Transportation – Bus or CRT (“Commuter Rail Transit”): Externally contracted routes with Denver
transportation partners; roughly 36% of CARES funding drawn through September 2020.

•

Funding appears to have been spent in alignment with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) intentions.

•

RTD appropriately balanced provision of transportation options with responsibility for its workforce and
regional economic stability in its funding decisions.

•

RTD worked to implement cost cutting measures to reduce the funds required for continued operations as
buoyed by CARES funding.

•

Arriving at the findings above required analysis, indicating RTD was not able to easily convey the information
to public in a meaningful manner.

13.F.a

In anticipation of continued declines in ridership, farebox revenues, and sales and use tax receipts, RTD adopted
of approximately 400 positions, or about 14% of RTD’s entire workforce. The 2021 budget totals $1.66 billion, a
reduction of $125.3 million (7%) from the amended 2020 budget and does not assume any additional federal
COVID relief funds beyond the CARES Act.
Additionally, on January 11, 2021 the FTA released the apportionments for $14 billion in Federal funding
appropriated by Congress through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of
2021 (CRRSAA) 2. The apportionment to RTD is approximately $203.4 million, discussed further below.

Recommendations: Spend Federal COVID-19 Relief Funds to Rebuild
Ridership & Improve Operations
The more than $700 million RTD will receive in Federal COVID-19 relief funding provides a revenue source for
RTD to implement the Committee’s recommendations, in alignment with federal funding guidance. The
Committee’s recommendations for spending these funds are targeted at stabilizing RTD operations, restoring
services, rebuilding trust, attracting new and returning riders, and helping the Agency recover from the COVID-19
pandemic. 3 As pandemic restrictions ease and more employees return to the workplace, there is an urgent, timelimited opportunity to attract them to commute via transit before their post-pandemic behavior is locked into
driving to work in a single-occupant vehicle instead.
1. Provide a transparent process and make priorities clear.
RTD should provide full transparency during deliberations regarding the use of these federal dollars so that
stakeholders and members of the public can follow the tradeoffs, including pros and cons of the RTD Board’s
decisions. RTD should clearly define its priorities for this funding, the issues being addressed by additional
funds, and the amount of funding allocated to each priority. This transparency should continue as funds are
spent so the public can track expenditures. As there may be a year-end surplus because of these funds, the
Committee requests accountability in the use of these dollars.
2. Strategically recall previously laid off front line employees.
The Committee acknowledges and supports RTD’s decision to recall approximately 200 direct-service
employees. However, in keeping with the above recommendation, RTD should explain the amount of its

its 2021 budget based on a continued service level of approximately 60% of pre-pandemic levels and a reduction

Final Report

13.F.a

federal stimulus funding allocation needed to recall these workers and the amount of funding remaining to
transit service, particularly to transit-dependent communities as quickly as possible.
3. Share federal stimulus funding with other transit service providers in the metro area.
There are several non-profit and community-based transit service providers in the RTD district. They
supplement RTD’s fixed-route and paratransit services, often at a cost lower than RTD could provide for
comparable service. As with RTD, these providers have been impacted by reduced ridership and lost
revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would benefit greatly from funding, where appropriate.
4. Conduct a six-month pilot to rebuild ridership and attract new riders via a reduced flat fare for local
and regional routes and free fares for all or some of the discount groups (youth up to 19 years old,
seniors 65+, disabled, and low income LiVE).
Market it as a simple, affordable, and easy to understand way to ride RTD and an incentive to attract
returning and new riders. This will reduce costs for financially struggling essential workers who are still riding
RTD. During the pilot program, use this time to explore other ways to improve affordability of existing and/or
new pass programs, including LiVE, that can be put in place as a longer-term solution.
5. Help rebuild and increase ridership by improving uptake and ease of use of passes.
Allow flexibility in the EcoPass programs and contracts so that more neighborhoods and businesses can
participate. For example, allow master EcoPass contracts to support county-wide affordable housing
programs and create more options for businesses to obtain employee EcoPasses for a subset of their
workers. Consider discounts for bulk pass purchases.
6. Help fund PEAK eligibility technicians/caseworkers at county HHS departments to help people
through LiVE enrollment and allow LiVE applicants to prove eligibility through verification
documents from other assistance programs (SNAP, WIC, etc.). Continuing to get the LiVE ID cards in
qualified participant’s hands is essential and counties can provide this customer assistance, but need
funding to help support this function.

Review of State Performance Audit
In December, 2020 the Colorado Office of the State Auditor published the findings of a Performance Audit
conducted between December 2019 through September 2020. A key concern of the State Auditor was a loss in
scheduled service due to operator vacancies. The State Auditor found bus and rail operators lacked meaningful
supervisory feedback, were not provided sufficient rest breaks, and were at risk of experiencing fatigue. The

13.F.a

The Operations Subcommittee assessed and discussed the State Auditor Report’s findings on operator retention
and human resources. The report described a series of recommendations to address and improve operator
retention. The Committee agrees with the findings of the report and encourages RTD to spend Federal relief
funding to support the implementation of the proposed recommendations 4.
Summary of report recommendations:
•

RTD management should take additional steps to improve supervisory practices around performance
feedback to address operator turnover.

•

RTD management should improve its processes to help ensure that bus operators receive adequate rest
breaks during their work shifts, in accordance with requirements in the Union Collective Bargaining
Agreement.

•

RTD management should improve its processes for assigning schedules to operators.

Governance and Executive Leadership
The Committee was tasked with reviewing the structure of RTD governance and executive leadership. Of
particular interest was elevating the voice of local communities and residents in transit service decision making
and restoring trust and confidence in RTD. The Committee evaluated models of peer transit agencies to
understand how RTD’s governance structure might be improved to meet these needs.

Subregional Service Councils
For several months, the Committee discussed concepts associated with a service council concept. Two
roundtable conversations with representatives from local governments and other stakeholders across the RTD
service area were held. Staff representatives from jurisdictions and organizations throughout the District
participated in these roundtables, sharing their experiences and perspectives.
The concept of the Subregional Service Councils was explored for improving collaboration with RTD on service
changes and increasing two-way communication. Subregional Service Councils were envisioned as locally
accessible public forums where transit users and community leaders make recommendations on proposed

Recommendations: Develop Subregional Service Councils
The Committee believes RTD should have a more collaborative decision-making structure to increase input from
local communities 5.
1. Subregional Service Councils: Revise RTD’s transit service planning process by establishing
Subregional Service Councils. Service Councils will have responsibility for developing and
recommending “local” transit service plans for the RTD Board’s consideration. The Committee
believes the introduction of this concept will:
•

Improve collaboration between RTD and the communities it serves.

•

Increase opportunities for public input through locally accessible forums.

•

Advance social equity goals by developing community-based transit plans that identify transportation and
service gaps, especially in low income and minority neighborhoods.

•

Promote innovative mobility solutions at a local level consistent with the RTD Board’s overall service
goals and objectives.

•

Provide an opportunity to address geographic equity and rebuild trust and transparency with
constituents.

2. Membership: The Committee recommends service councils be representative of the community-atlarge. Service council membership shall include:
•

Elected representatives, or their designee, from each city/town/county within each council district.

•

A broad spectrum of community interests and geography to ensure social, economic, financial, and
environmental equity considerations are represented.

•

Transit Users: residents who live, work, or attend school within the council district.

3. Districts: The Committee recommends RTD establish a workgroup of regional stakeholders to
comprehensively evaluate the following two service council boundary concepts to ascertain the best
fit for the Denver region. The workgroup shall consider the role and purpose of the service councils,
community cohesion and RTD staff resources in its analysis.
•

County Boundaries: The RTD service area encompasses wholly or partially Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson counties. The establishment of service councils based on
this pre-determined geo-political boundary would appear logical since local governments residing in the
same county already have a familiarity with each other. Additionally, county-based service councils

would be consistent with the already established DRCOG subregional forums which are utilized for
•

Travel Shed: A valuable tool for visualizing and analyzing mobility patterns. In the Denver region, known
travel behavior makes this concept a viable option particularly if fewer service districts is the objective.

4. RTD Resource Allocation: The Committee acknowledges the critical role RTD plays in fulfilling the
mobility needs of Denver area residents. Understandably, taxpayers are interested in having more
information of how their tax dollars are being used to create an equitable transit system. As a result, the
Committee recommends RTD develop and submit to the subregional service councils an annual report
illustrating how the revenues generated in each subregion are used to provide transportation “value” to the
residents of the subregion.

RTD Board of Directors
In response to stakeholder feedback concerning the size and effectiveness of the RTD Board, noting that
previous RTD Boards had demonstrated a tendency to take a more parochial point of view, the Committee
sought to complete an assessment of the RTD Board structure. This assessment evaluated peer agency
structures to understand how RTD may be aligned with or differ from peer agencies in its structure. The
summary of the assessment can be found at Appendix 4.

Recommendations: Explore Board Structural Modifications Subject to
Additional Study and Input
The structure of the Board of Directors differs from some peer agencies. The Committee believes a deeper
exploration should be pursued after Subregional Councils are implemented 6.
The Committee acknowledges a lack of consensus on how the structure of the RTD Board affects the
effectiveness of its decision making, neither is there clarity on the existence of a problem with the Board’s
structure nor what that problem may be. In addition, the Committee is making a series of recommendations (e.g.,
Subregional Service Councils) which, if implemented, may impact Board operations. Finally, the RTD Board is
proactively making changes to the structure of its Subcommittees and the organization has appointed a new
General Manager, both of which present opportunities for modifying the functionality of the Board.
When coupled with these changes, the finding that RTD’s Board structure differs from most other transit
agencies is not sufficient for developing recommendations, as they simply note areas of differences and
commonalities, as opposed to effectiveness. Therefore, it would be premature to develop recommendations for
future Board structures and the Committee suggests further study and analysis be completed by an independent

body with input from regional stakeholders. Specifically, the Committee recommends the following course of

•

Following a reasonable period of time for the Committee recommendations to be implemented and results
seen (e.g., two years), investigate the effectiveness of RTD’s Board structure. In partnership with regional
stakeholders, evaluate the historical context of RTD’s Board structure, define Board effectiveness, success
and efficiency, and evaluate past Boards’ records for meeting these criteria. Determine whether and where
problem(s) exists, and if so, develop a problem statement and recommended solution. If a problem does not
exist or inefficiencies are not found, the RTD Board structure should remain unchanged.

•

Where problems are identified or in instances where the Board could be operating more efficiently, conduct a
deep and thorough study of RTD’s Board structure in comparison with peer transit agencies and other
agencies within the region. Further examine the findings in this assessment and develop an understanding of
the impacts the implementation of any Committee recommendations.

•

Based on the findings of the study, determine if a new Board structure would better serve both RTD and the
region’s constituents. If so, outline a new Board structure, including roles and responsibilities, and revise the
by-laws if necessary.

Resource Prioritization Review & Financial Stability
The Committee reviewed the district’s short- and long-term prioritization of resources to ensure RTD is
maximizing available dollars and benefiting both taxpayers and the riding public. Additionally, the Committee
looked to determine the long-range financial stability of the Agency, and how the Agency can achieve stability
and growth while still meeting its core mission. The overall themes of these explorations were similar in nature
and viewed as a package. The Committee investigated the FasTracks program and evaluated Service
Performance and Financial Reporting Transparency. The Committee offers the following recommendations.

Northwest Rail/Unfinished FasTracks
FasTracks is RTD's voter-approved transit expansion program. Since 2004, RTD built 25.1 miles of light rail track
and 53 miles of commuter rail track, launched the Flatiron Flyer bus rapid transit service, and opened an
intermodal hub at Union Station in downtown Denver. These investments and projects represent over 75% of the
FasTracks program. Table 2 details the four unfinished corridors in the approved FasTracks program. The
Finance Subcommittee prepared and presented an analysis of Northwest Rail for discussion within the
Subcommittee, included as Appendix 5 to this report.

Table 2: Unfinished FasTracks Corridors

Recommendations: Explore FasTracks Options
The four unfinished FasTracks corridors, Northwest Rail in particular, pose a significant financial and operating
challenge for RTD. These recommendations provide opportunities to explore achievable options while continuing
to keep commitments to voters.
1. The Committee supports the Northwest Rail alignment for the Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR)
corridor and recommends RTD pursue all reasonable partnership opportunities with the FRPR
project. This route not only appears to provide significant benefits for the FRPR project but also offers an
opportunity to leverage investments and services to support Northwest Rail.
2. RTD should work with local jurisdictions and DRCOG to explore opportunities for transit-oriented
development and other strategies to increase projected ridership on the unfinished corridors.
3. RTD should investigate opportunities to increase non-RTD resources for transit stations including
local cost sharing, grants, tax increment financing, or public-private partnerships.
4. RTD should perform a complete and comprehensive analysis of the Northwest Rail project to
establish a common set of assumptions (including cost, ridership and timeline), and then engage in
a regional discussion about opportunities and alternatives, both near-term and long-term, for the
corridor.
5. RTD should work with CDOT and DRCOG to implement Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects in the
northwest region, beginning with SH 119, as identified in the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)

and the DRCOG 2050 Regional Transportation Plan. (see Appendix 6: RTD to Evaluate Potential BRT
In any scenario, RTD needs to pay down its debt before it can build and operate Northwest Rail. In the
interim, RTD should negotiate with the communities of the Northwest Corridor on how to provide more
immediate mobility to the region, such as accelerating expansion of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), while
continuing to evaluate Northwest Rail options.

Performance and Financial Reporting Transparency
Incumbent upon RTD, as a responsible steward of public funds, is to share performance and financial
information in a meaningful and accessible manner. While RTD currently publishes budget to actual data and
regular performance reporting via Board reports, the reporting mechanisms are neither straightforward nor easily
digestible for the layperson. Open, accessible data is necessary for building trust with the public so that it can
understand and be supportive of the services being subsidized through taxation. The Committee conducted
several conversations focused on reporting outcomes. Core topics of each conversation included existing RTD
capability, clarity of information, accessibility of information, and a long-term view of RTD’s financial outlook.
This, in combination with research and a review of dashboards of other agencies, informed the Committee’s
recommendations. Supplemental information on the proposed Performance Metrics can be found in Appendix 7.

Recommendations: Improve Reporting Metrics and Transparency
RTD should take steps to provide prominent, accessible and easy-to-understand financial and performance
information for the public, stakeholders, partners, and elected officials 7.

The Committee noted that the metrics outlined above, while measurable and applicable, do not capture the
full spirit and importance of measuring equity and accessibility. As such, stretch metrics have been identified
for further consideration. These stretch metrics will require a clear definition of terminology and success. In
some cases, these metrics may require access to data that is not currently available:

been identified for further consideration. These stretch metrics will require a clear definition of
terminology and success. In some cases, these metrics may require access to data that is not currently
available. It would also be helpful to use metrics that show how RTD is contributing to alreadyestablished regional, statewide, and federal metrics on ozone and greenhouse gas emission reductions.

Financial reporting
1. Provide a simplified version of financial budget information to include a simple one-page budget
document that is more accessible to the general public and easy to follow. Consider use of public
focus groups to help craft content and format.
Currently, RTD's website provides a great deal of financial information that is challenging to sift through and
understand. While this amount of detailed financial information may be useful in some situations and should
remain available for the public, RTD should create and update quarterly the following:

Attachment: RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee Recommendations)

•

13.F.a

RTD Accountability Committee

Packet Pg. 101

21

Final Report

A basic budget document (ideally in a one-sheet format). This should be a high-level summary document
that contains revenues and expenses by category in relation to the current adopted budget.

•

Capital project schedule and expenditure information updated at least quarterly.

2. Provide explanatory information on RTD's budget and the process it uses to form and finalize this
budget.
Even in a basic format, financial information can be difficult to interpret. By supplementing the above
recommendation with a high-level summary “translation” of the budget in easily understood language, RTD
can help improve the lay person’s grasp of the information. Alternative formats, such as videos, also provide
viable options. A layperson's overview of the budget itself would be useful, including available revenue
streams, primary expense categories, and defining terminology such as "Base System" and "Farebox
Revenue." This is also an opportunity to explain the fact that fares do not cover the full cost of a ride, which
is a common misperception. RTD should provide the following:
•

A description of the budget adoption process and the role of the Board of Directors.

•

A description of how the budget aligns with RTD's mission and performance objectives.

3. Include financial information on FasTracks that is easy to follow.
Given the public interest in and scrutiny of the FasTracks program, RTD can improve upon the availability of
public access to up-to-date financial information by enhancing its well-developed FasTracks website to
provide this data. The updated information should describe the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA),
how it is used, and any additional resources that help stakeholders and the public understand the status of
FasTracks projects. In developing this content, RTD should be mindful of public awareness when using
undefined terms such as "FasTracks,” "Base System," etc.
4. Provide a long-term vision for the use of federal stimulus funds as they continue to flow.
To date, federal stimulus money received by RTD from the CARES Act and CRRSAA has totaled over $430
million. The Agency is also expected to receive a third allotment from the most recent stimulus package.
RTD should provide a quarterly report with a full accounting on the use of these funds as well as share its
priorities for the third allotment, especially as these funds exceed what is needed to cover base operations
(including personnel costs). Materials should explain restrictions on stimulus dollars (what they can and
cannot be used for) and should provide, where relevant, a connection to the Committee’s recommendations
regarding the use of additional federal relief funds.

Improve Service to All Riders
The Committee also had a responsibility for reporting and making recommendations regarding how RTD can

populations. This mandate includes a review of the district’s plans for expanding ridership and understanding
Specific goals of the Committee included creating fare and pass structures that are easy to understand, ensuring
regional and subregional coordination, improving and promoting operational efficiency, and enhancing ADA
accessibility and service delivery.

Service Delivery
The Operations Subcommittee hosted discussions concerning service delivery where subject matter experts
within the region were invited to share their own perceptions of RTD service. Specifically, Colorado Cross
Disability Coalition (CCDC) shared its perspectives on fixed-route service (regularly scheduled service operating
on a predetermined route) from the point of view of the disability community. Representing the point of view of
the business community, Auraria Campus shared perceptions of RTD fixed-route services. Finally, Committee
member Krystin Trustman provided her perspective on this topic as a regular RTD rider and a member of RTD’s
Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee.

Recommendations: Improve Fixed-route and Paratransit Service
Provision
The Committee recommends the following actions to improve fixed-route and paratransit service provision 8:
1. Accessibility + Infrastructure
Improve accessibility at light rail and fixed-route stops. Proposed solutions include:
•

Zero-stair entrance at transit stations.

•

Standardize wayfinding signage and directional grooved pavement, ensuring some level of consistency
across similarly designed stations to ensure people who are blind can navigate transit stations.

•

Improve audio announcement systems to assist those in the blind community.

•

Identify a list of accessibility improvements with disability and mobility advocates and seek funding to
implement these projects, including federal infrastructure dollars as they become available.

•

Using existing survey data, work in partnership with municipalities to standardize and improve bus stop
placement to ensure greater accessibility.

Work with micro-mobility partners and municipalities to ensure transit stations have diverse mobility options
mobility issues) to provide riders the last mile connection to their destination.
3. Service Delivery
•

As Reimagine RTD continues its work, have this advisory body focus its redesign efforts on prioritizing
the travel needs of frequent transit users, including bus rapid transit.

•

Work in coordination with municipalities and anchor institutions to coordinate land use and transportation
planning to ensure a comprehensive network of transit-only lanes on major routes and equitable transitoriented developments.

•

Support limited access for pick- up by on-demand services like Taxi, Uber, Lyft and others that are
providing transportation for those with disabilities. Designated areas at the station would help provide a
seamless connection for transit riders.

Partnerships
One of the Committee focus areas is an exploration of how to enable partnerships with other transit agencies
and nonprofits to provide for better service inside and outside of the RTD service area. The Committee hosted
discussions with Via Mobility, the Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, Boulder County, the
City of Lone Tree and RTD. These organizations provided brief overviews of their current partnerships. The
Committee also discussed the potential role Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) could have in the
region. The Committee determined RTD should have additional flexibility and clear authority to contract with
nonprofits and local governments for service delivery to ensure cost-effective and efficient transit services. This
recommendation, noted below, includes the FreeLift Pilot, which is further described in Appendix 9.

Recommendations: Leverage Partnerships for Resources and
Services
Partnerships with local governments, non-profits, business, and institutions offer opportunities to leverage and
expand RTD resources and services 9.
1. Leverage existing and new partnerships to improve service efficiency and grow ridership. RTD
should emphasize partnerships with local governments, anchor institutions, transportation management
organizations (TMOs) and employers or employment centers who have a unique understanding of local
mobility needs.
2. Incentivize communities to enter cost-sharing arrangements with RTD to provide new or existing
local transit solutions in an effort to minimize service gaps and increase ridership.

with existing mobility service providers (e.g., Via, Uber, Lyft) in areas where traditional fixed-route
service may not be the most appropriate mobility solution. Also, explore opportunities to contract with
other third-party providers that may specialize in a particular service (e.g., paratransit) at a reduced cost.
4. As more federal relief funds become available, expand these partnership opportunities to improve
service efficiency.
5. Consider developing a competitive Innovation Grant program to drive bold ideas to increasing
ridership. Recipients would receive funds to dive deeper into project concepts and implementation, creating
models of innovation for the entire service area.
6. Encourage RTD’s public-facing dashboard to include a component that highlights existing private
and public partnerships.
7. Regularly evaluate the success of existing partnerships by predetermined metrics and “re-scope”
relationships to ensure maximum benefit.
8. RTD should pilot First/Last mile projects such as the First/Last Mile RTD FreeLift Loop partnerships
to build ridership, especially among disadvantaged communities. FreeLift pilots would serve
communities more than a mile from rail stations and be available only to RTD pass holders. The service
would be operated in partnership with TNCs or nonprofits such as Via Mobility Services and pick up
passengers at designated stops along a designated loop route.

Fare and Pass Programs
Recognizing the complicated nature of the RTD fare and pass program, the Committee sought to identify
opportunities for improved affordability and simplification of the program:
•

Aligning all discount fares (seniors, youth, persons with disabilities, and low-income)

•

Creating a simple fare and pass structure for customers and operators

•

Minimizing the cost burden to equity populations

•

Delivering communications through easy-to-access channels and easy-to-use tools

The Committee reviewed the current RTD fare structure and pass programs, the LiVE Program (discount fares
for low-income riders) and the administration of fare offerings. Subsequently, the Committee reviewed pass
programs at peer agencies including Houston Metro, Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), Metropolitan Atlanta
Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), King County Metro Transit, and Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA).
Finally, the Committee examined a fare relief and assistance program in Portland, Oregon and a proposal to
make fares free in Kansas City, Missouri. These conversations served as a backdrop for discussion and
formulation for the Committee’s recommendation.
The Operations Subcommittee also reviewed the findings of the State Auditor Report in addition to assessing
current challenges and opportunities for increasing ridership with consideration of operational goals. With the

recommendation to remove the farebox recovery ratio, this recommendation considers goals to assess

Recommendations: Simplify Fares and Pass Programs
RTD's fare structure and pass programs are complex and can be difficult to navigate. Also, RTD fares are some
of the highest in the country. The Committee recommends simplifying fares and pass programs and making them
more affordable to improve the customer experience and increase ridership 10.
1. Consolidate all discounts into a free (or at least highly discounted) fare that would cover equity
populations (youth, senior, disabled, and low-income).
•

Recognizing the potential barriers to free fares, the Committee recommends consolidating fares as
single 50% discount.

•

RTD should explore increasing the eligible age categories for free fares up to middle school or even high
school aged youth.

2. Identify strategies to simplify and incentivize pass structures.
•

Implement a “family plan” benefit for all RTD pass-holders, where an adult can purchase fare media
using one smart card for their multiple individuals. Standardize existing group pass programs (EcoPass,
NEcoPass, College Pass) into one brand, EcoPass, which is deeply discounted and focused on
incentivizing use.
o

Explore a “pay as you go” pass with fare capping/accumulators.

o

Make EcoPass available to every employee in the district (~1.5 million) through a monthly, per
employee transportation fee assessed on employers.

o
•

Explore the implementation of a recurrent “membership” model.

Incentivize individuals and organizations to purchase passes in bulk by:
o

Providing discounts for bulk purchases.

o

Enabling contributions to mobile wallets from multiple entities: both the employee/resident, and
from employers/governments/non-profits, allowing employers to match contributions directly on
the pass media of the employees.

•

Explore a “connect card” that allows riders to use transit fare across various entities (for example:
CDOT’s Bustang, and microtransit/mobility options).

•

Replicate pass types on the mobile platform with fare capping/accumulators (e.g., if you purchase fare
amounts that add up to a day/monthly pass, your fare is automatically converted as opposed to over
paying).

utilizing passes on a regular basis to determine updates to the agreements.
4. Implement equity in fare evasion enforcement.
The fine for fare evasion on RTD services is $75 and is set by State statute. Given that fare evasion and
illegal parking are similar offenses, this raises some equity concerns that transit riders pay higher fines than
car drivers. State lawmakers and RTD should explore legislation to address this inequity and assure
comparable fine levels for fare evasion and parking violations.

The Committee recognized the importance of integrating an equity lens into its recommendations. Because RTD
is intended to serve members of the District equally, careful consideration of the impacts any recommendations
may have on all populations was necessary. To ensure consistency in this approach, the Committee developed
an equity Mission Statement and established a template of relevant questions for its use throughout the
gathering of information. The template served as guidance to the Committee when evaluating the impact
recommendations might impose on the community.

Mission Statement
Social, economic, financial, and environmental equity is a paramount consideration for the Committee. The
Committee will consider the needs of communities of concern, including but not limited to minority, low-income,
individuals with disabilities, older adult, and veteran populations. Effort will be made through the Committee’s
work to ensure benefits are shared across the RTD service area and that no one group bears a larger burden of
environmental or financial impacts. Actions that include spatial and other forms of analysis, community
engagement, and consulting experts will be used at appropriate times to inform the work and final
recommendations of the Committee.

Operationalizing Equity in the Deliberation of the Committee and
Subcommittees
For each recommendation, participation was invited from community organizations with expertise in equity such
as the Center for Community Wealth Building, the Denver Institute of Equity and Reconciliation, and Mile High
Connects during initial deliberations of the Subcommittees as part of the research phase. Throughout the
formation and consideration of issues and policy options, an equality lens was applied. This lens served to focus
attention on the following questions:
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an
increase or decrease in equity?

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
b. How do we measure this impact?
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so,

Applying Equity Assessments to the recommendations
DRCOG staff and Mile High Connects assisted the Committee in conducting appropriate Equity Assessments of
draft recommendations. Early Equity Assessments were completed by DRCOG. The Committee subsequently
determined, as a measure of independence, that future Equity Assessment work would be completed by Mile
High Connects.
Draft recommendations, along with the assessments, were made available for public review and input. Each
Subcommittee considered the assessment and any input obtained through public engagement before moving
final Subcommittee recommendations to the full Committee.
The full Committee considered Subcommittee recommendations and finalized draft recommendations that were
brought to the public for input via an online survey and a public hearing. Input received from this outreach was
considered before the Committee finalized any recommendations. A decision was formalized to include
dissenting opinions, if any, in the final report of recommendations.

Equity Assessment methodology
DRCOG staff completed the Equity Assessment for spending COVID-19 relief funds prior to the Committee
engaging Mile High Connects to complete the remaining assessments. DRCOG’s approach examined each
distinct recommendation with respect to the guiding questions above. The Equity Assessments were then
distributed to the Committee and shared in its meeting packets. During Committee meetings public comment was
accepted and Committee Members shared their views of the analysis.
Mile High Connects leveraged its regional network in its approach to evaluating the equity of the
recommendations. An ad-hoc equity working group consisting of community leaders and organizations, was
facilitated by Mile High Connects staff alongside an external facilitator. Participants in these Equity Assessments
included representatives from Conservation Colorado (transit advocacy and environmental justice), Colorado
Fiscal Institute (policy and finance), Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition (justice reform and health care),
Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (transit advocacy and disabilities rights), Denver Streets Partnership (transit
advocacy), and the Fax Partnership (housing and business). Recognizing the interrelatedness of the
recommendations, the working group completed assessments as packages.
The recommendations contained in Part 1 of this report have been analyzed with respect to the questions asked
in the Operationalizing Equity in the Deliberation of the Committee and Subcommittees section above, resulting

The Equity Assessment for the use of Federal COVID-19 relief funds was completed by DRCOG staff. There are
six distinct recommendations specific to COVID and other Federal stimulus funding. They are:
1. Provide a transparent process and make priorities clear.
2. Strategically recall previously laid off front line employees.
3. Share federal stimulus funding with other transit service providers in the metro area.
4. Conduct a six-month pilot to rebuild ridership and attract new riders via a reduced flat fare for local and
regional routes and free fares for all or some of the discount groups (youth up to 19 years old, seniors
65+, disabled and low income LiVE).
5. Help rebuild and increase ridership by improving uptake and ease of use of passes.
6. Help fund PEAK eligibility technicians/caseworkers at county HHS departments to help people through
LiVE enrollment and allow LiVE applicants to prove eligibility through verification documents from other
assistance programs (SNAP, WIC, etc.). Continuing to get the LiVE ID cards in qualified participant’s
hands is essential and counties can provide this customer assistance with needed funding to help
support this function.
The Committee determined an Equity Assessment was not necessary for Recommendation 1 “Provide a
transparent process and make priorities clear,” as equity is the foundation upon which this recommendation was
developed. Therefore, only Equity Assessments for recommendations 2 through 6 are provided below.

Equity Assessment: Spend Federal COVID-19 Relief Funds Recommendations
Recommendation 2: Strategically recall previously laid off front line employees.
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
This recommendation may benefit communities of concern by restoring employment for employees who
may have not found other employment. Many of these front-line employees, such as bus and rail
operators and mechanics, could be vulnerable without employment if they do not have sufficient savings
to pay for their needs. It could also provide benefit to communities of concern more broadly if the reemployment of frontline workers also means additional transit service for transit-dependent populations.
This is likely to create an increase in equity.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
A benefit is something that can help improve the lives of front-line employees temporarily out of work
and the mobility of transit-dependent populations. A burden is something that can curtail it.

RTD Accountability Committee

Packet Pg. 111

31

Final Report

13.F.a

This impact can be measured by assessing the number of frontline employees who are reemployed

2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
This recommendation could benefit communities that have their transit service increased or restored
because more frontline workers are reemployed and providing increased service.

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
If service is restored or increased for routes serving low-income, veterans, older adults, individuals
with disabilities, minorities, zero car households, and other communities of concern there could be a
benefit to those communities. Many of the frontline workers who would be reemployed could be
members of one or more of these communities.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
This recommendation is for an action district wide. There is no anticipation for any disproportionate
impacts or requirements to fall upon any neighborhoods.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
A possible unintended consequence of this recommendation rests with the continuation or replacement of
the funding stream. Once stimulus funds have been exhausted a risk exists that, without new sources of
revenue, employment may again be curtailed and any new services cut or eliminated. There could be an
additional burden to RTD if frontline employees are laid off another time as there is significant cost
associated with retraining frontline employees. This can be mitigated by reviewing revenue projections and
rehiring based on conservative estimates to ensure needed dollars are kept in reserve for one or more future
budget years.
4. Does this policy/strategy address historic, systemic, environmental, or institutional barriers that have
impacted this community?
This recommendation can address barriers by rehiring frontline employees who may belong to one or more
vulnerable communities and restore or increase transit services for communities with transit-dependent
populations.
Recommendation 3: Share federal stimulus funding with other transit service providers in the metro
area.

or decrease in equity?

RTD Accountability Committee

Final Report

13.F.a

This recommendation could benefit communities of concern, especially older adults and individuals with
additional benefit to RTD as the operating and maintenance costs for non-profits that provide mobility for
older adults and individuals with disabilities typically is less than RTD’s Americans with Disabilities
Paratransit Service (Access a Ride), meaning these agencies could provide services to people that
otherwise would use Access a Ride and increase RTD costs. This is likely to create an increase in equity.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
A benefit is something that can help improve the mobility of communities of concern by giving them
greater access to their community. A burden is something that can disadvantage communities of
concern by reducing their access to mobility.

b. How do we measure this impact?
The impact can be measured by how many more trips can be provided to transit-dependent
populations.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
This recommendation could impact transit-dependent populations, especially older adults and individuals
with disabilities throughout the Denver region.

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
Older adults and individuals with disabilities.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
The impact of this recommendation would likely be distributed throughout the Denver region.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
Funding provided to other transit agencies would reduce how much can be spent on RTD services. This can
be mitigated by RTD studying the potential impact to its own services before deciding how much funding to
share with other agencies.
4. Does this policy/strategy address historic, systemic, environmental, or institutional barriers that have
impacted this community?
This recommendation addresses access to mobility for transit-dependent populations, especially older adults
and individuals with disabilities.

flat fare for local and regional routes and free fares for all or some of the discount groups (youth up to 19
years old, seniors 65+, disabled and low income LiVE).
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
This recommendation could benefit communities of concern in a few ways:
•

By making it more affordable to ride transit

•

An increase in ridership from reduced fares could have the potential to restore or increase
services in communities with transit-dependent riders

•

A flat fare can reduce confusion over how much it costs to ride for all riders including
communities of concern

This is likely to create an increase in equity.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
A benefit is something that can help improve the mobility of communities of concern. A burden is
something that can curtail it.

b. How do we measure this impact?
The impact can be potentially measured by measuring the increase/decrease in ridership after
implementation of the recommendation.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
This could impact communities of concern but not necessarily any specific geography. Older adults and
individuals with disabilities could see the most benefit as their fare cost could be reduced since RTD is
federally obligated to offer a fifty percent discount to these communities based on the regular fare.

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
Several communities of concern could benefit from this recommendation.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
This recommendation would carry equal benefit throughout the RTD district.

reduction in services that RTD cannot afford to provide. RTD can mitigate this adverse outcome by studying
its potential impact before implementation.
4. Does this policy/strategy address historic, systemic, environmental, or institutional barriers that have
impacted this community?
Fare cost and complexity (hard to understand how much it costs to ride) have been cited as barriers to
ridership.
Recommendation 5: Help rebuild and increase ridership by improving uptake and ease of use of
passes.
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
Making it easier to obtain and use passes could make it easier for all populations to use transit. It could be
especially beneficial for communities of concern as the challenges with obtaining passes and understanding
how to use them may pose a greater difficulty for them. This will likely create an increase in equity.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
A benefit is making it easier for communities of concern to ride transit. A burden could be making it
more difficult.

b. How do we measure this impact?
We can measure the increase/decrease in ridership, especially for communities of concern. Ridership
for communities of concern may be discerned from rider surveys.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
This recommended change would likely impact all areas of the RTD region similarly. Communities of
concern could see greater benefit as the challenges with obtaining passes and understanding how to use
them may pose a greater difficulty for them.

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
This recommendation could benefit all communities of concern across the RTD district although more
benefit may come to those who live close to transit than those who do not.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise

3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
An unintended consequence could be money used to improve pass programs could otherwise have been
used to provide more services. If the work to address this recommendation is done efficiently, the impact to
the operations and maintenance budget should be minimal.
4. Does this policy/strategy address historic, systemic, environmental, or institutional barriers that have
impacted this community?
The proposed recommendation change can address barriers to accessing transit, a challenge that is
possibly felt more by communities of concern.
Recommendation 6: Help fund PEAK eligibility technicians/caseworkers at county HHS departments to
help people through LiVE enrollment and allow LiVE applicants to prove eligibility through verification
documents from other assistance programs (SNAP, WIC, etc.). Continuing to get the LiVE ID cards in
qualified participant’s hands is essential and counties can provide this customer assistance but need
funding to help support this function.
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
This recommendation may benefit communities of concern by potentially making it easier for eligible
individuals to register for this cost saving program. Further, it could reduce wait times. This recommendation
may burden communities of concern if enrollment increases beyond the capacity of the allotted funding and,
therefore, possible outcomes could be eligible clients either denied access to the program or wait listed.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
A benefit is something that can help improve the access to affordable fares for communities of
concern. A burden is something that can curtail it.

b. How do we measure this impact?
This impact can be measured by how many additional individuals are enrolled.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
This recommendation could benefit many communities, but it would likely benefit individuals with low income
the most because of the potential to make riding transit more affordable. While there are concentrations of
low-income individuals in certain places, there are individuals with low incomes living across the entire RTD
district.

While people of any demographic could have low income, certain groups may be more vulnerable:
veterans, older adults, individuals with disabilities, minorities, zero car households, and other communities
of concern.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
This recommendation is for an action district wide. There is no anticipation for any disproportionate
impacts or requirements to fall upon any neighborhoods.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
As previously mentioned, there is a possibility that enrollments can exceed allotted funding. This can be
mitigated by finding additional resources.
4. Does this policy/strategy address historic, systemic, environmental, or institutional barriers that have
impacted this community?
This recommendation can address barriers to providing affordable fares for low-income riders by potentially
making it easier for eligible individuals to enroll in the LiVe program. This provides RTD flexibility to reduce
fares, especially for low-income riders.

Improve Fixed-route and Paratransit Service Provision and
Operator Retention
This Equity Assessment was completed by the Mile High Connects working group. The overall desired outcome
was to assess the Operations Subcommittee’s proposed recommendation on fixed-routes and paratransit service
provision. The comments and recommendations are offered with an understanding that input was being sought
from community organizations outside of the Committee’s standing process and with limited information on the
background and history of how the recommendation was formulated. The ad-hoc working group reviewed the
Fixed-Route and Paratransit Service Provision and Operator Retention recommendations as a package.

Overall Comments and Strategic Recommendations
•

Be inclusive of people with disabilities throughout the work on this recommendation: The working group
strongly recommends working directly with people with disabilities to listen and center their needs around
accessibility. The working group also encourages clarity around what is meant by “pipeline of accessibility
improvements” that is currently stated in the recommendation.

•

Displacement mitigation: As with other recommendations, the working group encourages RTD to consider
impacts of displacement on low-income communities with expansion and development around transit lines.

Equity Assessment: Fixed-route and Paratransit Service Provision and Operator
Retention Recommendations
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
This recommendation may result in moderate to high benefit to communities of concern as it focuses on
accessibility, multimodal transit options, and service delivery. These elements are central to RTD being more
efficient and increasing ridership. The working group highlighted the importance of including people with
disabilities to offer input on the recommendation on accessibility and to include safety with accessibility and
multimodal considerations. For multimodal and access considerations, language access is important
(multilingual options for apps, way finding in multiple languages).
The working group could not offer recommendations on the operator retention as the recommendations from
the report were not included.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
Benefits of accessibility and infrastructure are focusing on people with disabilities. Burden is the
recommendation may not have included people with disabilities when developing it and safety is not
currently paired with accessibility and infrastructure considerations.
Benefits of multimodal transit options give riders access to last mile solutions. Burden is it may not be
available outside of the urban core, riders with children may not be able to use multimodal options and
riders with disabilities may not be able to use these options, riders where English is not their primary
language may not be able to access and use multimodal options, low-income riders may not be able
to afford multimodal options.
Benefits of transit service is increasing ridership and providing public transit to more communities.
Burden is displacement issues and transit costs for low-income riders, consider offering multimodal
pass (public transit, TNCs).

b. How do we measure this impact?
Survey data on fixed-route and paratransit service provision once changes have been implemented.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
Yes, it may impact low-income communities of color and people with disabilities across all areas of the
recommendations. People with disabilities may not be able to access transit based on what types of

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
This recommendation affects the entire region therefore an analysis of the demographics of the most
impacted areas is not applicable.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
As the recommendation is currently written, there are no specific neighborhoods required to help
achieve this policy recommendation.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
People with disabilities may be left out of the development of the accessibility and infrastructure
recommendation and possibly its implementation. Multimodal transit options may not be viable for people
with disabilities, riders with children, low-income riders, and riders who speak a language other than English.
Ways that this can be mitigated is by centering those with disabilities and partnering with multimodal outlets
to ensure accessibility (language, people with disabilities, cost).

Governance Recommendations
This Equity Assessment was completed by the Mile High Connects working group. The overall desired outcome
was to assess the Governance Subcommittee’s proposed recommendations. The comments and
recommendations are offered with an understanding that input was being sought from community organizations
outside of the Committee’s standing process and with limited information on the background and history of how
the recommendation was formulated. The ad-hoc working group reviewed the Governance Executive Leadership
and Subregional Service Council recommendations as a package.

Overall Comments and Strategic Recommendations
•

Board of Directors (BOD): Working group understands that RTD Board is on par with other cities across
the US and that revisions and changes will not happen at this time. However, in the future, it recommends
diversifying Board membership (demographically, lived and professional experience, understanding and
supporting public transit, inclusion of transit and city planners, leaders from local municipalities); proposes a
hybrid model with elected and appointed (clarity around appointing body); and giving consideration to the
size of the Board (7 Board members).

•

Clarify the role of Local Service Councils (LSC): Continue to explore the role recommended LSC’s can
play as potential decision making bodies that are more connected to local communities.

available outside of the urban core, riders with children may not be able to use multimodal options and
riders with disabilities may not be able to use these options, riders where English is not their primary
language may not be able to access and use multimodal options, low-income riders may not be able

Yes, it may impact low-income communities of color and people with disabilities across all areas of the
recommendations. People with disabilities may not be able to access transit based on what types of
infrastructures and accessibility improvements are made. Low-income riders may be displaced with transit
expansion and riders may continue to not be able to afford transit.

Transparency and Reporting
This Equity Assessment was completed by the Mile High Connects working group. The overall desired outcome
was to assess the Operations and Finance Subcommittee’s proposed recommendations. The comments and
recommendations are offered with an understanding that input was being sought from community organizations
outside of the Committee’s standing process and with limited information on the background and history of how
the recommendation was formulated. The ad-hoc working group reviewed the reporting metrics and financial
transparency recommendation as a package.

Overall Comments and Strategic Recommendations
•

Transit expansion and community development: As with other recommendations, the working group
continues to highlight the importance of considering displacement and gentrification with the buildout. RTD
should explore the possibility of CLT’s with local municipalities and other policies to ensure low-income
communities can stay in place or access affordable housing.

•

Dashboard: Managing and sustaining metrics and utility: There is a focus on increased transparency by
providing a dashboard, however the working group recognizes that timely updates are necessary. RTD
dedicated staff is necessary to maintaining the dashboard with current metrics. A second imperative is to
ensure the dashboard is accessible, usable, and easy to navigate on the part of the public, advocates,
nonprofits, municipalities, resident groups, and more.

•

Definitions of equity: The working group noticed the broad sweeping definition of equity in the metrics. The
term equality is used, which is different from equity. It is important to define equity consistently. RTD may
want to consider revising this along with including safety in its definition of equity.

Recommendations
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
This recommendation may have some benefit to communities of concern. The utility of the dashboard should
be centered if it is to be accessible to a diverse array of constituents, including community residents,
advocates, nonprofits, community groups, municipalities, and more. The recommendation is likely to
increase equity if the dashboard is designed, implemented, and utilized by its intended audiences.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
Benefit to the community is the sharing of data and information equitably along 23 defined metrics
under the following key areas: Operational Effectiveness, Financial Performance, Customer
Experience, Community Engagement, Equity & Accessibility, Environmental Impact, and Safety.
Burden is around the accessibility of the data: data available in multiple languages; literacy;
accessibility to diverse audiences; consistent updating and refreshing of the data.
Benefit of continuing to measure ridership is to gain a better understanding of who is riding, who is
being served through transit. Burden is that it is not considering which communities are not being
served by transit.

b. How do we measure this impact?
The impact of this recommendation would be assessed by garnering data on who is using the
dashboard and their intended purpose for the data/information.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
This recommendation will most likely only be relevant to constituents that are privy to transit; they either work
in the industry or work in an adjacent field or industry that is connected to transit (direct service agency, etc.).
Considerations should be made to broaden the audiences that will use the dashboard.

c. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
Not applicable.

d. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
As the recommendation is currently written, there are no specific neighborhoods that are required to
help achieve the policy recommendation, meaning that all neighborhoods would be required to

implementation, it is important to recognize that nonprofits and community-based organizations do not
ease of use and translation of data/metrics for a variety of constituents.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
The general public may not use the dashboard or understand the metrics. Ensure that a variety of
constituents can use the dashboard in a wide variety of ways. Proactive engagement of different audiences
and soliciting feedback in the development of the dashboard can mitigate the unintended consequences.

Partnerships
This Equity Assessment was completed by the Mile High Connects working group. The overall desired outcome
was to assess the Governance Subcommittee’s proposed recommendations regarding partnerships. The
comments and recommendations are offered with an understanding that input was being sought from community
organizations outside of the Committee’s standing process and with limited information on the background and
history of how the recommendation was formulated.

Overall Comments and Strategic Recommendations
•

Provide clear definitions and guidance: Partnerships, anchor institutions, and other language is used
which may not hold a common definition in the region. Similarly impacted communities are not clearly
defined. The working group offered the environmental justice definition for consideration: Disproportionately
impacted community means a community that is in a census block group, as determined in accordance with
the most recent US decennial census, where the proportion of households that are low-income is greater
than forty percent, the proportion of households that identify as minority is greater than forty percent, or the
proportion of households that are housing cost-burdened is greater than forty percent.

•

Focus on worker dignity: Recognize that shifting service from RTD to mobility service providers will result
in equity as well-paid jobs transition to gig-employment.

•

Expansion of partners: Suggestion to also include schools and service providing organizations as anchor
institutions.

Equity Assessment: Partnership Recommendations
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase

The working group noted some of the possible inequities in the proposal to partner with existing mobility
providers. The working group had inquiries around this: How are these providers supporting worker dignity?
Are the mobility service providers accessible to multilingual riders and riders with disabilities?

Benefit is defined as offering expanded service and ridership by partnering with local governments,
centers who have a unique understanding of local mobility needs. Burden is defined as the lack of
inclusion of other institutions such as schools and service organizations as well as consideration of
median incomes in surrounding communities of anchor institutions.

b. How do we measure this impact?
Expand the types of partners that qualify as anchor institutions.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
Working group highlighted the location of anchor institutions may be in middle- and higher-income
neighborhoods and communities, which can lead to inequities in partnerships for low-income neighborhoods
that may not benefit or be included in the partnerships.

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
Working group assumes that demographics around most of the anchor institutions is middle to uppermiddle class, white, English is the primary language, able bodied, etc.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this raise
issues of equity and justice?
Partnership recommendation as written does not explicitly name schools or service providers as
anchor institutions. Including these types of partners may increase equity and access for low-income
communities and communities of color and has the potential to increase ridership.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
Key partners could be left out of the opportunity for partnership with RTD and mobility service providers may
not be protected as partners with RTD. Expand who is an anchor institution and ensure worker protections.

Fare and Pass Programs
This Equity Assessment was completed by the Mile High Connects working group. The overall desired outcome
was to assess the Committee’s proposed recommendation for streamlining fares and passes. The comments
and recommendations are offered with an understanding that input was being sought from community
organizations outside of the Committee’s standing process and with limited information on the background and
history of how the recommendation was formulated.

•

Be cautious about centering on large employers and businesses: The focus on the EcoPass raised
inequity concerns for frontline employees that may not have access to the EcoPass in its current form.
Recognize that large employers do not represent the most marginalized, transit-dependent riders.

•

Limit the burden of proof on income-qualified individuals: Requiring low-income individuals to provide
proof of poverty is inequitable as employers are not required to do the same.

•

Offer a free pass for low-income riders: Working group supports this as an option overall to support lowincome riders and increase ridership.

Equity Assessment: Streamlining Fares and Passes Recommendations
1. How could this recommendation benefit or burden communities of concern? Is there likely to be an increase
or decrease in equity?
The recommendation may result in moderate benefit to communities of concern, depending on the
implementation and operationalization of the proposed fare and pass changes. The ad-hoc committee raised
diverse language access, fare capping, and simplifying income verification as an opportunity to increase
equity for all riders on the RTD system, while expansion of the EcoPass in its current form could decrease
equity if it solely focuses on large businesses where equity populations may not hold positions of power.

a. How are we defining benefit and burden?
Benefit is defined as an opportunity to improve equity populations' access to various pass and
fare programs. Burden is defined by the real or perceived challenges to diverse businesses in the
region, recognizing that small to midsize businesses may not have equitable access to transit
passes and fare structures for their employees.

b. How do we measure this impact?
Continue to look at the data of ridership and use of various pass media.
2. Could this recommendation impact specific communities or geography more than others? If so, which
communities and how?
Working group noted the inequities in affording various fare media and in support of a free fare to
address some of these inequities.

a. What are the demographics of the most impacted areas?
Small/micro-businesses with modest annual revenues will be most impacted by an employer fee.

b. Are neighborhoods equally required to help achieve the policy recommendation? If not, does this
raise issues of equity and justice?

As written, neighborhoods and institutions (businesses, anchor institutions, etc) are equally
within low-income/equity neighborhoods that may bear the burden of additional costs without
resources.
3. Could there be unintended consequences? If so, can they be mitigated?
The equity working group shared the unintended consequence of bias in current fare evasion practices
by RTD that may impact low-income people of color who are transit-dependent. RTD enforcement may
be unaware of how racism is impacting fare evasion.

Overview
The RTD Accountability Committee released draft recommendations for public review on June 2, 2021. An
online survey was open from June 2 through June 15 and additional public comment was received via email
and at a public hearing held at the June 14 committee meeting.

Survey Responses
A total of 433 responses were received. The survey provided short summaries of the RTD Accountability
Committee’s recommendations, as well as a link to the full draft document detailing the recommendations.
Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with each of the summarized recommendations,
and to provide any additional written feedback. This survey is an engagement tool for collecting
feedback from the public; it is not intended to express a scientific, statistically-valid representation
of all of the region’s residents.

Respondents
Most respondents were transit users and lived in Denver or three other counties (Arapahoe, Boulder,
Jefferson).

13.F.a

In reviewing these survey results it is important to keep in mind that 80% of the respondents considered
population of the Regional Transportation District.

Summary
Most respondents said they strongly agree or agree with all the Accountability Committee’s
recommendations. The degree of support varied by specific recommendation, but respondents generally
expressed support for everything the committee recommends. Respondents agreed most with the
recommendations related to strategies for improving RTD’s service delivery. They agreed least with
recommendations for emphasizing partnerships with local governments, anchor institutions, transportation
management organizations, and employers or employment centers.

Governance
Almost three-quarters (73%) of respondents agreed with the
recommendation to create subregional service councils.
Q1: The Accountability Committee believes RTD should have a more collaborative decision-making
structure to increase input from local communities. As a result, the Committee recommends forming
subregional service councils throughout the RTD service area with representation from the community.
These subregional service councils would have responsibility for developing and recommending “local”
transit service plans for the RTD Board’s consideration. Rate your level of agreement with the
recommendation to create subregional service councils.

Northwest Rail/Unfinished FasTracks
Nearly three-quarters (72%) of respondents agreed with the idea of focusing
on bus rapid transit until adequate funding is identified for the Northwest Rail
line, with 42% of those strongly agreeing. However, 15% opposed this
recommendation.
Q4: Due to a heavy debt burden, RTD cannot afford to begin construction on the promised northwest rail
line from Denver through Boulder to Longmont at this time. The RTD Accountability Committee recommends
that until adequate funding can be found for this project, RTD should focus on significantly expanding Bus
Rapid Transit services like the existing Flatiron Flyer, including direct service to Longmont and other
Northwest Corridor communities by 2026 while continuing to pursue longer-term plans for the completion of
Northwest Rail.
Rate your level of agreement with the recommendation to focus on Bus Rapid Transit until adequate funding

Appendix 2: Transportation Funding Proposal
Letter
April 15, 2021
Dear Senators Winter and Fenberg and Representatives Gray and Garnett,
Thank you for your ongoing leadership in working to solve Colorado’s transportation challenges. As
members of the RTD Accountability Committee (RTDAC) that you and Governor Polis created last year,
we’d like to provide you with input on your transportation funding proposal. In particular, we would like to
express our strong recommendation that the draft legislation be amended to include additional funding for
transit and other multimodal transportation options.
As you know the RTDAC was created to provide recommendations on how RTD could improve its
operations to help achieve better and more equitable service, expand ridership and improve the Agency’s
financial sustainability. Our nine months of analysis and inquiry have confirmed our understanding that
transit systems like RTD’s deliver multiple critical benefits to the region and state beyond those directly
experienced by those who use bus and rail, making them an appropriate and necessary recipient of
increased public investment.
Transit contributes to the state and regional economy by providing mobility for Coloradans traveling to and
from their workplace, school, shopping, medical appointments, recreational opportunities and cultural
events, as well as serving out of town visitors. Public transit systems represent an affordable and equitable
mobility option for older adults, people with disabilities and youth who cannot drive, as well as community
members who cannot afford to own a car. By providing an alternative to single-occupant vehicle travel,
transit helps reduce traffic congestion for those who do drive cars. Transit systems are also a key solution to
reducing the air pollution that degrades our public health, generates the brown cloud that mars our world
class views, and drives our region’s serious non-attainment status for meeting the Clean Air Act’s ozone
standard. Similarly, significantly increasing ridership on buses and rail lines is necessary to meet the state’s
climate targets set in House Bill 19-1261; Governor Polis’ Climate Roadmap sets a goal of 10% reduction in
vehicle miles travelled by 2030, which is not possible with only modest levels of multimodal investment.
Conversely, increasing funding for roadway expansion as the primary means to address Colorado’s mobility
challenges will further exacerbate our ozone and climate emission woes, undermine our investments in
transit, and ultimately increase congestion through induced demand.
Consequently, while we greatly appreciate that your draft proposal includes new multimodal funding for
transit and funding for transit electrification, we believe it doesn’t go far enough. The RTDAC urges you to
provide comparable investment between multimodal transportation options and road infrastructure spending

Coloradans can enjoy improved transit service, and local communities can improve first and final mile bike

Overall, Colorado contributes significantly less money to its transit agencies than other states. According to
the FTA’s 2019 National Transit Database, in Colorado, the state funded only 0.33% of transit operating
costs and 2.59% of transit capital costs in 2019, compared to the much higher national average of 23% and
23%, respectively.
While we applaud CDOT’s effort and commitment to outreach in developing of the 10 Year Plan, we do not
believe the Plan has enough funding for transit projects, especially in the Denver metro area. CDOT’s 10
Year Plan lists $4.9 billion worth of transportation projects with less than 9% for transit. With more than half
the state’s population living in less than 8% of its land area, the Denver metro-area offers the best
opportunity to replace driving trips with transit and other clean transportation modes. To cut transportation
pollution and improve system efficiency, Colorado must invest heavily in transit service where we have the
highest concentration of people and jobs.
DRCOG identified 10 Bus-Rapid Transit (BRT) projects in their 2050 MetroVision. Each of these projects
were selected through an extensive vetting process in RTD’s 2019 BRT Feasibility Study based on their
ability to generate ridership, improve equity, reduce emissions, and improve connectivity and access. Yet
the 10 Year Plan lists and just partially funds a few of these projects. CDOT’s 10 Year Plan should include
significant funding to complete all 10 Bus-Rapid Transit (BRT) projects in the DRCOG region by 2030,
projects that align with state and regional transportation goals to reduce congestion and pollution, while
improving safety, equitable, and affordability.
We also believe it is essential that the legislation state explicitly that HUTF dollars can be spent on transit
operating and maintenance costs, which can help create a more sustainable funding stream for ongoing
transit operations in communities around the state. Additional transit service along existing transit routes
would dramatically improve access to jobs for millions of Coloradans, especially in the Denver metro area.
For example, according to the Transit Center, a 40% increase in RTD transit service – about $74 million per
year – would allow Denver residents to access four times more jobs in a 30-minute transit commute.
Thank you again for your leadership and your willingness to consider our comments.
Sincerely,

RTD Accountability Committee:

As part of its assessment of RTD governance, the RTD Accountability Governance Subcommittee,
commissioned its contractor, North Highland, to undertake a high-level comparative analysis of RTD’s Board
structure with other peer entities’ Boards. The RTD Accountability Governance Subcommittee requested an
independent assessment to identify external structures that may improve the RTD Board’s effectiveness.
The following provides a summary of findings. The full report can be viewed here. Findings include:
•

RTD’s term durations are on par with peer agencies.

•

Comparatively, the RTD Board’s compensation is on par with peer agencies.

•

The RTD Board is on par with its peers as it relates to transparency and public participation.

•

RTD is unique to this peer group in that Board Members are elected.

•

It is unclear if the size of the Board is comparable to its peers.

•

Approaches to regional/subregional Board representation vary among peer agencies.

Regional Transportation District Board
The Regional Transportation District supports 40 municipalities and is the primary transit provider for Denver
and its surrounding areas, including the Counties of Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, and Jefferson, and parts of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld Counties. RTD provides bus, light rail, demand response, and
commuter rail services. The RTD Board is structured as follows:
•

Board Size / Scope: The RTD Board is composed of 15 members serving 8 counties and 40
municipalities. RTD provides bus, light rail, demand response, and commuter rail services.

•

Board Selection: Members are publicly elected and serve four-year terms.

•

Structure: RTD Board Committees include the Executive Committee; General Manger Oversight and
Performance Management Committee, Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee, Finance,
Administration, and Audit Committee; Operations/Customer Service Committee, Communications and
Government Relations Committee; and Ad-Hoc Committees as appropriate.

•

Community Representation: Each Board member represents a particular district in an effort to provide
equal representation and encourage equity among all Board activities.

•

Compensation: Board members are compensated $12,000 per year plus any expenses incurred.

•

Transparency: The Board must provide notice of all meeting types to the public at least 24 hours prior
to a meeting being held. Agendas, documents, and video of past meetings are available online. Board
meetings are open to the public and include an opportunity for public comment. Committee meetings are
open to the public but do not allow a period for public participation.

RTD conducts staggered elections so that eight seats are open for one election, followed by seven available

Board or the Chair when necessary, annual Board planning meetings, study sessions as needed at the
vote of at least eight Directors. The Board must provide notice of all meeting types to the public at least 24
hours prior. Agendas, documents, and video of past meetings are available online.
Outside of the Board activities, RTD's community practices provide opportunities for anyone in the area to
become involved by simply staying informed, or engaging further by sharing their voice, becoming a partner,
or engaging with RTD. The public also can participate in town halls, comment on proposed service changes,
submit a project feedback form, or contact a director or customer care agent. Additionally, the public can act
as a partner by serving on an advisory committee or participating in pilot programs and market research; and
further engagement is encouraged through presentations by RTD staff and participation in the RTD transit
experience.

Information for Selected Peer Agencies
North Highland reviewed the documentation available regarding Board structures for the selected peer
agencies. This included (where available) Board bylaws, meeting minutes, legislation, resolutions, and
manuals as available.
The gathered information provided sufficient detail to assess RTD’s Board in comparison with peer Agencies
along several dimensions discussed below. Peer agencies included: Utah Transit Authority (UTA), Dallas Area
Rapid Transit (DART), Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet), San Diego
Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS), Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA),
King County Department of Metro Transit (King County Metro), Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority
(WMATA), Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (Sound Transit), and Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA METRO).

Findings
The information collected enabled North Highland to compare RTD’s Board structure with that of peer
agencies. In some respects, RTD’s Board structure is on par with peer agencies, yet there are some marked
differences between agencies. These findings are detailed further below.

Commonalities with other Boards
RTD’s term durations are on par with peer agencies
All ten agencies evaluated posed term durations either ranging from one to five years, or whose
appointment coincides with the term of their appointer. For those agencies with defined durations, a term
duration of nearly three years was the average. With term durations of four years, RTD appears to be on par

Comparatively the RTD’s Board compensation is on par with peer agencies
While many of the Boards evaluated in this assessment are compensated according to the number of
meetings attended (ranging from $0 to $200), the RTD Board is compensated at an annual rate of $12,000
per year (or $1,000 per month) as detailed in Table 1: Board Member Compensation. When examining the
RTD Board calendar, it is possible that members could be attending a handful of meetings, to up to eight
meetings per month. At eight meetings per month with compensation of $125 per meeting places RTD
Board compensation on par with its peers.

online. Posted materials include Board agenda, minutes, packets/presentations, and video of the
to be no time constraint on sharing these materials. This indicates RTD’s practices are on par with peer
agencies in transparency.
The RTD Board approach for public participation includes a public comment period as a part of the Board
meeting agendas. This is consistent with all agencies evaluated. The time allotted for public comment
varies, from no time constraint to as few as 15 minutes. Many Boards pose a time limit on individuals (such
as two or three minutes) in place of limiting the time allotted on the agenda. Both WMATA and Sound
Transit also allow individuals to provide written comments that are read at Board meetings.

Unique aspects of peer agency board structures
RTD is unique to this peer group in that Board Members are elected
Of the ten peer agencies evaluated, only RTD has elected Board Members. With the exception of King
Country Transit, which is governed by elected County Commissioners, all other agencies’ Board members
are appointed. Appointees may or may not be elected officials. Appointments often reflect the
regional/subregional model by which agencies are represented. For example, agencies governed at the
county or state levels are often appointed by the State Governor or legislative bodies. In other cases, district
models, similar to the approach at RTD, are leveraged, yet Board Members are appointed, often under the
requirement that the member live in the district they represent.
While the review of these peer agencies did not find publicly elected Boards, it should be noted this is a
practice for Boards at other transit properties. Specifically, both Bay Area Rapid Transit 15 (BART, in San
Francisco, California) and Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District 16 (AC Transit, in Oakland California)
publicly elect Board members.

It is unclear if the size of the Board is comparable to its peers
Best practice shows that as governing Boards grow in size the efficacy of their work decreases. When
evaluating Board size, RTD’s peer agencies average 11.6 Board members wherein RTD’s Board is
comprised of 15 members, indicating the RTD may be large in comparison with its peers. Other agencies
with similar Board representation include DART, MTS, SEPTA, and LA Metro. It should be noted however,
that both DART and MTS Board members represent the smallest area and the smallest number of
constituents (see Table 2: Board Member Representation Analysis), indicating these agencies may have a
disproportionately large Board. When comparing member representation per square mile only two other
properties, UTA and King County Metro, have Board members representing more square miles. However,

Approaches to regional/subregional representation vary
In reviewing how Board membership relates to geographic representation, models across the Boards
included in this assessment varied with little consistency as shown in Table 3: Regional Representation
Approach. In the classification outlined below, a regional model indicates representation at the county or
state level, while a subregional classification indicates representation at a district or municipality level. Other
agencies, however, deploy a hybrid approach, with both regional representation and local level
representation either with municipalities or established districts/regions. In most cases, representatives are
required to live within the district or region they represent.

Appendix 5: FasTracks Analysis by the Finance
Subcommittee
The B Line / NW Rail Conundrum
RTD is facing the most severe
financial challenge in its history.
The promises made 17 years ago
when Colorado voters approved
FasTracks were based on
projections for sales tax revenues
that were stunted by the Great
Recession and have recently once
again been depressed by the
COVID crisis. Meanwhile, the
original estimated cost of the B
Line has tripled to $1.5-1.7 billion,
while the pandemic has driven
FasTracks ridership down to a
third of what it was in 2019. And
the cost will likely be significantly
higher by 2042.
The taxpayers from Broomfield to
Boulder to Longmont are justifiably
angry that the service they were promised by 2017 is now being projected for 2042—two decades into an
uncertain future. They are demanding a solution from a transit agency that has been financially forced to cut
its services by 40% over the past year. There is lots of heat on this issue, but not a lot of light. Here are
alternatives RTD is currently considering:
RTD collaboration with Front Range Passenger Rail: One of the three proposed routes for prospective
$2 billion Front Range Passenger Rail follows the path of the B Line. Unfortunately, it would only stop at
Union Station, Boulder, and Longmont and would be limited to only two to six round trips per day. The full
vision for Front Range Passenger Rail projected 20 to 30 years out is estimated to cost between eight and
fourteen billion dollars. By comparison, in 2018, the sum of all taxes paid to the state totaled less than $11
billion. Given Colorado voters’ history of rejecting transportation funding initiatives that asked for a fraction of
that funding—and for highways, not a visionary rail project—it is hard not to be skeptical.

13.F.a

B Line rush-hour only service: RTD is considering a rush-hour only service that would cost $708 million
disgruntled parties. But more importantly, the economic justification of such an investment is shaky at best.
Note that workdays with rush hours = 52 x 5 - 10 for holidays = 250 rush-hour days per year. The average
estimate for annual operating and maintenance cost is $13.5 million (RTD Board NW Rail Study Session,
2/9/21, page 43). Unfortunately, RTD must bond and pay interest on every major project it builds. Based on
a 30-year useful life and a 30-year bond, here is the math:
•

Financing $708 million at 2% interest over 30 years: total principal plus interest cost is $1,132 million.

•

Transit cost per year = $13.5 million/year + ($1,132 million ÷ 30 years) = $51.23 million per year

•

$51,230,000/year ÷ (1600 trips/day x 250 days/year) = $128 per trip

Even if the net fare revenue after pass discounts was $4, which is $8 round-trip—a high estimate—RTD’s
net cost per ride would still be $124, an irrationally high subsidy.
The economics of the B Line extension: RTD’s latest estimates for B Line ridership is 5,400 per weekday
by the target year 2035. They have also estimated weekend ridership at half of weekday ridership. So, we
can estimate annual ridership as 5,400 x 52 x (5+½+½) =1,684,800 boardings per year. We’ll use a 30-year
useful life and the 2019 RTD Draft Initial Unfinished Corridors Report (page 5), estimated annual operating
and maintenance cost for the B Line extension of $20,600,000 per year. At an estimated $1.5 billion
construction cost and a 30-year bond, here is the math:
•

Financing $1.5 billion at 2% interest over 30 years: total principal plus interest cost is $2.4 billion.

•

Transit cost per year = $20.6 million/year + ($2,400 million ÷ 30 years) = $100.6 million per year

•

$100,600,000/year ÷ 1,684,800 trips/year = $59.71 per trip

After pass discounts, the 2019 RTD rail service average boarding fare was $2.08, so RTD’s net cost
per boarding would be about $57.63. At 1,684,800 trips per year, that would add a new $97 million
unfunded yearly obligation to RTD’s annual budget. Given that RTD’s 2020 Amended Budget for
FasTracks Operations (Exhibit 1, Page 3) shows revenue from FasTracks Sales Tax ($135M) and Use
Tax ($15M) that total only $150 million, it is not clear how RTD could afford this extra $97 million per
year—especially with existing annual FasTracks Project interest expenses already totaling $152
million (Exhibit 1, Page 2). This is simply not an economically sustainable obligation for RTD.
Conclusion: The Legislature and the Governor charged the RTD Accountability Committee with ensuring
the long-term economic viability of RTD. It is doubtful that any of these three “solutions” accomplish that
goal, at least until most of RTD’s FasTracks debt can be paid off. Waiting 20+ years for rail service is a nonstarter. We would welcome anyone’s ideas and suggestions and would sincerely appreciate hearing about
any errors you see in this analysis or any challenges to this approach to accounting for costs.

Appendix 6: RTD to Evaluate Potential BRT
Benefits
Recommendation: RTD should evaluate the validity of the suggested benefits
of a BRT solution and respond to the RTD Accountability Committee.
There are encouraging signs that NW Rail may benefit from a partnership with Front Range Passenger Rail
(FRPR). FRPR hopes to obtain a significant part of the project cost from US DOT/Amtrak for train service
from Trinidad to Fort Collins and beyond. A bill in the Legislature is also seeking to create a special taxing
district along the planned path of FRPR to seek funding through a ballot initiative—a process similar to
FasTracks. The goal is a 100+ mph train costing between $8 to $14 billion, though it may begin with a
smaller-scale proof of concept. The hope is that this would be a Denver-Boulder-Longmont rail line. This
choice could potentially accelerate the delivery of NW Rail. The BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) rightof-way would be used, with BNSF building the rail at a cost yet to be determined.
If built, it will hopefully follow a path along the planned route of NW Rail. If so, RTD might be able to use the
same tracks for NW Rail. However, FRPR would only stop at Union Station, Boulder, and Longmont. RTD
would need to pay to add railroad sidings at five other stations along the way: Westminster, Church Ranch,
Flatiron, Louisville, and Gunbarrel.
As an interim step in the process, the RTD Board has approved an $8M study of a rush-hour-only service.
This study will begin at the end of 2021 and should be completed by 2024. This initial study would need to
be followed by a complete Environmental Impact Statement before final construction design, leasing, and
planning. The eventual rail project would be a partnership among FRPR, BNSF, CDOT, Amtrak, RTD, Army
Corps of Engineers, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and Northwest Corridor
communities. Here is a flow chart of RTD’s Implementation Needs Summary for the NW Rail Project:

However, given the operational, political, economic, and other risks inherent to a complex project such as
this, it is difficult to estimate the date at which NW Rail passenger service might begin. Given the time frame,
it seems prudent to consider and evaluate the alternative option of expanding existing Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) services while pursuing developments on NW Rail. Note that the recommended BRT solutions are
based on the Northwest Area Mobility Study and the work of subsequent groups such as Commuting
Solutions and the Northwest Mayors and Commissioners Coalition.
We request that RTD specifically respond to each of the following claims. Then, if enough of the
claims have merit, the RTD Board, in partnership with the Governor, CDOT, and various
communities and organizations representing the Northwest Corridor, can decide whether to pursue
a BRT solution while awaiting developments on NW Rail.
Here are the six specific claims, followed by the supporting documentation for each:
Compared to NW Rail, a BRT solution will:

Deliver services a decade or more sooner than rail.
Better accommodate future growth than rail.
Be far less expensive to implement than rail.
Be far less expensive to operate than rail.
Be far less expensive to maintain than rail.
Be far less of a threat to RTD’s future financial stability.

Of course, if everything goes smoothly with FRPR, NW Rail might also be available within the next decade
or so. But BRT is now and is low risk.
Here is a brief discussion of the justification for each of these claims.

72

Final Report

RTD Accountability Committee

73

1. A BRT solution will deliver services a decade or more sooner than
rail.
Claim: Already done, since RTD’s Flatiron Flyer BRT (FF BRT) began operations January 3, 2016,
and has already served millions of riders a year.
In 2019, the FF BRT provided 3.37 million boardings (see RTD Service Performance 2019, Networked
Family of Services, page 19, Route FF). That is twice the RTD staff’s projected 2035 NW Rail boardings.
Note that RTD estimated 5,400 NW Rail weekday boardings by 2035 in their RTD Board NW Rail Study
Session, 2/9/21, packet page 28. That equals about 1.68 million boardings per year.
Before the pandemic, FF BRT offered seven Boulder-Denver routes. In addition to express buses, some
routes provided stops serving Table Mesa, McCaslin, Flatiron, Broomfield, Church Ranch, and Sheridan.
Service intervals ranged from 10 to 30 minutes (see below), depending on the route and time of day.
However, since the 2020 pandemic, four routes were suspended, and only three of the seven routes are
still operating.

2. A BRT solution will better accommodate future growth than rail.
Claim: The FF BRT configuration can expand to accommodate twice the total projected 2035 NW
Rail ridership.
Using the CARES funding, RTD has already brought back many of the bus operators and maintenance
and support personnel needed to restore Flatiron Flyer service to pre-pandemic levels. There are also
buses in storage from the 2020 service cuts. Given the popularity of the Flatiron Flyer buses—as
demonstrated by its past high ridership—RTD should prioritize rapid restoration of all seven routes to
2019 schedules.
Doubling the bus frequency would have little impact on US 36 traffic but could add twice the

capacity needed to serve all of RTD’s projected 2035 NW Rail riders. As the economy continues to
RTD Accountability Committee

Packet Pg. 154

Final Report

74

13.F.a

recover, RTD could selectively expand services on popular routes. For example, if a bus pulls out of the
miles down the road, so there is plenty of capacity on US 36 for expansion. Moreover, since these buses
would be carrying far more passengers than the average vehicle, they would also significantly reduce
rather than add to congestion. And though the capacity of stations might have to be expanded as BRT
ridership grew, the expansion would be gradual and demand-driven. If the ridership didn’t grow as
expected, less expansion would be needed.
Growth by rail: RTD’s planned schedule for Line B/NW Rail is “30 minutes peak (6-9 am, 3-6 pm) / 60
minutes off-peak service.” That implies 7 + 5 + 7 + 4 = 23 round trips, or a weekday extra 46 trains on
the tracks. BNSF, which owns the rails and right-of-way, currently runs 10 to 17 freight trains per day
over this route. With NW Rail, that’s about four times as many trains, each of which stops traffic both
ways. These delays annoy the folks stalled at RR crossings, worried about being late for work, while
commuters’ idling cars and the diesel trains kick up our ozone levels. And that’s before Amtrak/FRPR
adds their rolling stock.
Are we confident that this expansion will not be an issue for BNSF’s freight operations? Whoever writes
the rail lease contracts must ensure that more trains can be added at a reasonable cost as Colorado’s
Front Range grows. According to CDOT, Colorado’s population may increase by 1.69 million over the
next 20 years, mainly along the Front Range.

3. A BRT solution will be far less expensive to implement than rail.
Claim: The US 36 FF BRT managed lanes and transit stations are already in place, and the
Boulder-Longmont SH 119 BRT is planned, could begin final design and construction within a
year, and be completed within five years.
While an additional $135 million in funding and a high implementation priority is needed for this project,
$115 million has already been committed by RTD, DRCOG, CDOT, Boulder, and Longmont. This project
was a key priority of the 2014 Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) group and has broad support
within the NW Corridor, including the Northwest Mayors and Commissioners Coalition. Compared to
the $1.5 billion (2018 dollars) for NW Rail, this is a modest investment. It is estimated to reduce
RTD’s BOLT line Boulder-Longmont travel time from 66 minutes to 38 minutes. Given the number
of Longmont residents who can’t afford Boulder housing costs, this route is critical to both local
economies. The extra lanes, including turn lanes, inside managed lanes, and cycle paths will
ensure free-flowing traffic for personal autos, heavy trucks, transit customers, and cyclists for
years to come.

station and averages 60 mph, and the next one leaves ten minutes later, the first one is already ten

RTD Accountability Committee

Packet Pg. 155

4. A BRT solution will be far less expensive to operate than rail.
Claim: The US 36 FF BRT managed lanes and transit stations are already in place, and the
Boulder-Longmont managed lanes will be free for BRT buses.
The cost per boarding for NW Rail must include the cost of building and maintaining the rail. But since
BRT buses have free access to public highway’s managed lanes, they don’t bear this burden. Why?
CDOT isn’t building managed lanes just for a public bus that comes along every few miles. The
managed lanes are for all vehicular traffic, though single-occupancy vehicles are often restricted or
required to pay tolls. But BRT buses carry numerous commuters, thus reducing the other vehicular
traffic. And so, CDOT lets RTD buses use the lanes for free. CDOT pays the construction and
maintenance costs of BRT’s managed lanes.
NW Rail will share new tracks which are to be built by the BNSF Railroad on the right-of-way
owned by BNSF. While it is not yet known what BNSF will charge for access to these tracks, the
total project cost for NW Rail is estimated to be $1.5 billion (2018 dollars). Assuming 30-year
financing at 2% interest, the total cost with interest would be $2.4 billion, or $80 million per year.
Add RTD’s estimated $20.6 million per year operating and maintenance cost, and RTD’s total
annual cost is about $100 million.
RTD’s estimated NW Rail initial weekday ridership is 4,100 (in RTD-speak, “boardings”). With half
that on less busy weekends and ignoring holidays, that is equivalent to 1.28 million boardings per
year, at the cost of $78 per ride.
In 2019, the Flatiron Flyer BRT provided 3.37 million boardings at the cost of $23.36 million, or
$6.93 per boarding. And if you adjust for the $6.74 million in fares, the net expense to RTD was
$4.93 per boarding. So, BRT is like getting the rails for free, and then some.

5. A BRT solution will be far less expensive to maintain than rail.
Claim: The “tracks” of BRT are managed lanes built and maintained by CDOT. Maintaining buses
is something at which RTD excels. RTD has people with extensive experience and skills in this

Unlike trains, BRT buses operate on public highways. Therefore, there is no repair and maintenance as
need maintenance.
The 2019 Flatiron Flyer BRT’s total cost for operations and maintenance plus a share of RTD’s
administrative costs and depreciation on all assets was $6.93 per boarding. At RTD’s estimated $20.6
million for operations and maintenance, based on 1.28 million boardings per year, the boarding cost is
$16.09. And that may not include the 30-year depreciation on the $1.5 billion asset, which would add
another $39. But either way, BRT is a relative bargain.
RTD is very knowledgeable about the maintenance and repair of conventional buses. However, if RTD
chooses electric buses, there will be some significant upfront costs in retraining technicians. However, since
there are so few moving parts in electric vehicle drivetrains, the maintenance costs will be far lower over the
long term.
Conventional buses have internal combustion engines and complex transmissions, both with thousands of
moving parts. Electric motors have less than ten moving parts—though there will typically be multiple drive
motors. They also have no transmissions: more current and the bus goes faster, less current and the bus
goes slower, no current and regenerative braking slows the bus and recharges the battery. Reverse the
current polarity, and the bus backs up.
Most electric vehicles also do not require conventional lubrication or oil changes. And though they cost more
to purchase, those costs are recovered by very long useful lives and lower maintenance and fuel (renewable
electricity) costs.
The price of diesel emissions, however, is paid in asthma attacks, premature deaths, and a warming planet.
In evaluating conventional versus electric transit buses, we encourage a careful read of NREL’s 2020
research report, “Financial Analysis of Battery Electric Transit Buses.”

6. A BRT solution will be far less of a threat to RTD’s future financial
stability.
Claim: RTD struggles to meet its existing debt obligations while managing its current bus and rail
transit operation deficits. The risk will be far greater if it attempts to build NW Rail before
substantially reducing its long-term debt—which will likely take over two decades. A BRT solution
can be delivered 15 years sooner than NW Rail while minimizing the threat to the future financial
stability of RTD.

RTD’s FasTracks (RTD-speak for rail) debt service consumes 65-70% of its annual Sales and Use Tax
six years and are being covered by drawing down cash reserves—which may run dry. The 2021 deficit
is projected to be $42 million. (p. 54)
There are no Base System (RTD-speak for Bus Services) funds available to support FasTracks
operations or Unfinished Corridors since the Base System (bus services) unrestricted fund balance is
projected to be negative through 2049. The cost of build-out of the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors,
including NW Rail, is $2.09 billion (2018 dollars), with additional operations and maintenance costs of
$30 million/year. (p. 50-51)
The conclusion of RTD’s Feb. 9, 2021 study is that without additional sales tax revenue, NW Rail
service could not be provided before 2046. (p.53)
For reference, here is the original 2004 FasTracks NW Rail Plan (p. 30)

A 2010 evaluation raised the cost estimate to $1 billion (2010 dollars), with double-track throughout.
However, recognizing the constraints of Denver’s Union Station, they were forced to reduce the train
frequency to a 30-minute peak, one hour off-peak (55 trains per day, bi-directional service). (p. 33)
Note that the frequency of service has a significant impact on people’s willingness to use transit (“How
long do I have to wait for the next train?”). By comparison, here are the scheduled Flatiron Flyer bus
frequency schedules before the 2020 elimination of four of the routes:

It is no wonder that this BRT service attracted 3.37 million riders in 2019. And by increasing the bus
service frequency, RTD could expand the FF BRT to support all the projected 1.28 million additional
NW Rail boardings for far less than $1.5 billion. Thus, BRT can exceed the 2004 FasTracks promises
at a fraction of the cost of rail.
Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars received from the CARES and CRRSSA grants, RTD
continues to operate at a significant loss. These are grants that RTD cannot rely on in the future.
It will be many years before RTD can pay off the debt it incurred by building rail projects. Until then,
RTD cannot build NW Rail and come close to supporting the operating losses of the current rail lines.
But by choosing BRT, RTD can exceed FasTracks’ promises without further risk to RTD’s long-term
financial stability.

Closing Notes
While financial and operational analyses don’t make for great reading, their understanding is essential
to RTD’s ability to deliver the transit services Colorado needs to grow and thrive. Budgets are moral
documents, and unless RTD is financially sustainable, many Coloradans who live paycheck to
paycheck will lose those paychecks. As a result, families will suffer, and small and large businesses
dependent on a stable workforce will either fail or leave our state.
Those who can afford it will often resort to single occupancy used vehicles chosen for low price rather
than efficiency, further clogging our highways and adding to a growing brown cloud and warming
planet. We need transit solutions that move as many folks as possible out of these single-occupancy
gasoline vehicles and into efficient, safe, and affordable transit—and renewably-powered electric
buses, not diesel locomotive trains.

The time has come to find solutions that meet the needs of all the people of the Northwest Corridor—
Lafayette, Broomfield, and the smaller communities in the Corridor. Bus Rapid Transit is a practical and
cost-effective way to meet those needs without waiting decades. And by delaying the high cost of NW Rail,
there will be more resources available to address the remaining unfinished FasTracks routes. All have paid
their taxes, and it is time to deliver on FasTracks’s 2004 transit promises. BRT can meet and exceed those
promises.

North Highland, as part of its on-call consulting service contract with the Committee coordinated through the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), was directed to conduct a high-level assessment of
peer agencies’ performance measures to inform performance measures developed for public reporting. One
goal of the Committee is to increase transparency in RTD’s performance reporting. This summary provides
an overview of the results. The full report can be viewed here.
The RTD Accountability Committee sought recommendations for performance metrics to describe the RTD’s
performance and increase transparency. Key activities within the project scope include the following:
•

Peer Agency Evaluations – Conduct research of peer transit agencies to understand publicly available
performance metrics. Meet with an RTD representative to learn RTD’s current access to data, capability
in analyzing data, and future-state plans for dashboard reporting.

•

Facilitated Discussion with RTD Accountability Committee – Conduct a facilitated discussion session
with joint members of the Operations and Finance Subcommittees to understand the information the
Committee seeks to learn from the established performance metrics.

•

Study collected information – Analyze the findings from the peer agency evaluations and the
Subcommittee’s input to determine what metrics in use at other agencies may be applicable to RTD.

•

Propose Performance Metrics for use by RTD - Based on the results of the peer agency evaluation and
metric analysis completed, propose a series of performance metrics, inclusive of goals for consideration
by the RTD Accountability Committee.

Review of Other Agencies
The research component of this work included collecting and organizing data related to current RTD and peer
agency metrics and strategic priorities. The five peer agencies assessed as part of North Highland’s research
efforts include Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), Utah Transit Authority (UTA), Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA METRO), Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
(WMATA), and Portland Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet).
North Highland aligned its research of these agencies with the established scope of work in conjunction with
a review of RTD’s current performance metrics. The research of the peer agencies focused on seven key
themes discussed in further detail below.

Operational effectiveness
Operational effectiveness represents performance metrics that are inclusive of RTD’s service delivery. RTD
provides a variety of transit services and measuring how well and effective the delivery of those services is

13.F.a

vehicles, distance between vehicle failures, ridership metrics, and capacity. North Highland found that each

Financial performance
Financial performance metrics are indicators of the organization’s financial success. Operational budget,
capital budget, asset management, costs of operations, as well as bond rating are all examples of financial
performance measures. Each of the five peer agencies had variations in what financial performance metrics
they were collecting and reporting. The most common financial performance metric is operating cost,
measured by three of the five agencies.

Customer experience
Customer experience metrics are an indicator of overall customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction for
each of the agencies differs based on their strategic plans, however most of the agencies reporting on
customer satisfaction measured complaints or issues reported. Other examples of customer satisfaction
metrics from the five peer agencies include call volume and answer rate, percent of issues resolved, ticket
vending machine repairs, crowding, and average time to resolve issues.

Community engagement
Many transit agencies are finding ways to engage with their communities and its stakeholders. Community
engagement metrics are measures that indicate the extent to which RTD is partnering with the surrounding
community. North Highland reviewed the five agencies for indicators of community engagement such as
number of outreach events, current community partnerships, and board/committee representation of the
breadth of the organization’s service area. One organization chose to measure community engagement
through surveys. Other organizations measure social media posts, follows, engagements, or partnerships
with local governments.

Equity and accessibility
Equity and accessibility metrics indicate the extent to which RTD services are available to all riders,
particularly the disadvantaged populations such as ADA or minority/low-income people. Equity and
accessibility metrics include number of accessible stations, streamlined routes, and paratransit operations.
Only one of the five agencies collect numerous metrics related to equitable service accessibility specifically
measuring the number of lines serving areas with higher-than-average population of persons of color and
low-income persons, stop amenities, percent of housing within walking distance of stations and stops,
percent of employment accessible by all transit, and on-time performance for lines serving areas with higherthan-average percentage of disadvantaged persons. Other metrics related to ADA accessibility such as

Final Report

82

13.F.a

Environmental impact measures indicate the impact RTD has on the environment. Examples could include
total annual emissions and the agency’s contribution to the regional economy. Measuring environmental
impact was not common among the five peer agencies and only two are currently reporting on
environmental impact metrics. While these metrics are not commonly reported on, they are important for the
overall transit industry. North Highland found the metrics currently being reported included pounds of
seasonal air pollutants prevented, total building energy use, percent of low emission vehicles in the fleet,
options for electric and alternative fuel, and progress of climate change initiatives.

Safety
Safety should always be a priority and is a good indicator for understanding how well an agency is keeping
its passengers and employees safe. All five peer agencies report various safety metrics publicly. The most
common safety metrics include passenger or employee injuries, number of reportable accidents, crime
rates, and number of preventable accidents. Other examples of safety measures include collisions, lost time
per employee (injuries on duty), derailments, fire incidents, and number of signal violations.

Recommendations and Findings
Within the seven metric areas (operational effectiveness, financial performance, customer experience,
community engagement, equity and accessibility, environmental impact, and safety), North Highland heard
fourteen (14) major objectives from the Operations Subcommittee. Connecting metrics to these objectives
helps prioritize action on these objectives. The right metrics provide leading and lagging indicators for further
analysis and resolution.
Note: We understand RTD is in the process of developing a new strategic plan and is seeking to implement
a more robust performance measurement system. The Subcommittee may wish to put forth the
recommendations in this report to supplement RTD’s ongoing work in concert with the efforts of the
Accountability Committee.
The table that follows outlines 23 proposed metrics. The metrics proposed were created with the intent that
they could be reasonably captured by RTD (e.g., they should not require additional studies or extraneous work
effort to ascertain). In some instances, RTD is regularly reporting the metric as outlined, or some variation
thereof, in quarterly Board Reports. It is possible RTD may be reporting on other metrics through internal
reporting or dashboards.

Appendix 8: Transit Agency Partnerships with
Transportation Network Companies
DART, MARTA, King County Metro, MBTA and Miami-Dade Transit
DART
In 2020 Dallas Area Rapid Transit awarded Uber a three year contract to provide rideshare service to
supplement DART’s GoLink program, which is an on-demand shuttle service. Thispartnership aims to supply
greater service capacity to the GoLink program which currently serves 13 different zones in the Dallas area.
DART has been piloting service partnerships with TNCs since 2017 when they partnered withLyft to
increase paratransit services provided by MV Transportation. Adding Lyft as a partner increased paratransit
capacity by 7%. Through this system, MV Transportation acts as a dispatch service, scheduling and
coordinating subcontractors like Lyft, taxis, or vehicles with wheelchair lifts. While the cost remains the same
for riders within this system, the partnershipallows for increased flexibility and capacity.

MARTA
The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority and Uber have partnered for a one year pilot program,
MARTAConnect, that began in November 2020. The goal of this program is to provideriders with
supplemental transportation and greater flexibility when there are service disruptions,given that the agency
is still running limited service due to COVID-19. The pilot was launched on Election Day as
MARTAConnect2Vote and provided $16 Uber vouchers to help riders access polling locations that were not
covered because of suspended services. After Election Day MARTAConnect has continued with some
variations. MARTAConnect provides customers with Uber vouchers when there is a planned or unplanned
service disruption in order to travel toan unaffected station. Vouchers range from $3-$10, and if riders use
the Uber ride to travel to their destination or past the geo-fenced station, they are charged the additional
distance.

King County Metro
The Seattle area transit agency is in the second year of a pilot program with the public mobility service, Via,
to provide the Via to Transit program. Via to Transit is an on-demand, shared shuttle service with the goal of
connecting riders to bus and light rail stations. Riders can use the Via app or call to request service, which
usually takes 15-20 minutes and costs the same asa Metro bus ride. The rider must either start or end their
trip at one of the designated transit stations. The program has been initially successful, and after a brief
suspension due to COVID-19, the program is operating again and the agency continues to monitor

King County Metro has also partnered with ridesharing apps to connect riders for their carpooling program.
Shared mobility options are part of King County Metro’s long-range plan.Partnering with private companies
such as Waze, Scoop, and Rideshare help to supplement King County Metro’s service and provide
connections to transit and employment hubs.

MBTA
The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority is currently conducting a paratransit pilot program partnering with
Uber, Lyft, and Curb. This program is an on-demand service provided for ADA paratransit service users, aimed
at lowering cost and wait times and increasing flexibility. The program requires users to sign up through the
partnered companies to receive a set number ofsubsidized rides. Customers pay the first $2 and any amount
over a $42 trip cost, with the exception of UberPOOL, for which the customer pays the first $1 and any amount
over a $41 trip cost. All three companies have an option for a wheelchair accessible vehicle.

Miami-Dade Transit
In April 2020, the Miami-Dade Transit agency partnered with Uber and Lyft to supplement overnight service due
to COVID-19 related service cuts. The program, Go Nightly, seeks to provide essential workers and transitdependent populations with continued transportation options during bus service suspension. This service is
available along the suspended bus routes between the hours of 12 AM and 5 AM. Service is requested online or
by calling, andfares for the Go-Nightly program are suspended.

Appendix 9: FreeLift | Demand Driven First/Last Mile
Partnerships
A Proposal from the Finance Subcommittee
FreeLift will provide about five free shared rides to transit stations for the $22.60 average subsidy of a single
FlexRide passenger. It will focus on low-income Coloradans in underserved communities who are most in need
of dependable access to education, training, and better-paying jobs. FreeLift is the key to restoring RTD’s
ridership to pre-pandemic levels while shifting commuters from SOVs to transit. It is also an ideal model for costsharing partnerships with local governments and employers and service delivery partnerships with
Transportation Network Companies (TNCs).

Here’s how FreeLift works
The initial pilots serve communities more than a mile from rail
stations. Only committed public transit users with RTD
passes are qualified for this free benefit. Community
members who wish to give RTD a try receive a free 15 or 30day transit pass. The TNC driver’s smartphone scans the
pass and records the picked-up passenger’s pass ID,
location, date, and time, then continues on the loop to the rail
station.
FreeLift is not a door-to-door service. Instead, drivers pick up
passengers along higher population density streets or at
community gathering places. RTD pass holders can request
rides on the TNC app, which displays currently operating
FreeLift vehicles on a street map or walk to a gathering
Figure 1: Elyria-Swansea FreeLift Loop

place. TNCs will pick up three or more passengers along the
loop for a quick ride to the rail station, then loop back for

another trip, potentially carrying return fares.
Pickup/drop-off sites will be at designated locations within a few blocks of many homes. This is similar to how
existing TNC rideshare programs operate and should not require excessive software development efforts by the
TNC or RTD.

A win for customers and RTD
Let’s say RTD pays a base of $7 plus $2 each for three passengers (or up to five in an SUV, seven in a van).

13.F.a

RTD would provide TNC wait spaces
returning passenger pickup locations. If
it takes 15 minutes to drive the loop,
that’s $52/hour, though roughly a third
goes to the TNC with the rest going to
the driver. Larger TNC SUVs or vans
can earn significantly more. RTD pays
$4.33 per rider, less than a fifth of
today’s FlexRide passenger subsidy.
And this is a free, market demanddriven system—no rigid schedules, no
near-empty 14-passenger buses

Figure 2: Aurora Hills FreeLift Loop

roaming the streets. Plus, three or four passengers means far fewer stops. And RTD offers TNC drivers a
“target-rich” source of riders.
There will be many other details to negotiate with the TNC—such as open access to the TNC’s driver/passenger
rating system—but this proposal provides a general idea of how FreeLift will work. Some FreeLift services may
also be partnerships between large employers and RTD. While it will need pilots to optimize the service
efficiently, FreeLift will open new markets for RTD and the TNC, driving ridership while providing public transit
access for underserved communities. In summary:
•

FreeLift gives RTD market access to underserved neighborhoods, increasing ridership and equity

•

Communities bypassed by station location decisions gain access to public transit

•

Requiring passes, which are often discounted for low-income residents, encourages transit use

•

No significant capital costs and operating costs shared by employers and local government

•

This model can focus on underperforming rail lines, underserved minorities and later expand to BRT and
buses

Special FreeLift services for customers with moderate disabilities
Access-a-Ride will still be the best solution for RTD customers with disabilities that require heavy, non-folding
motorized wheelchairs. However, many customers with more moderate disabilities who live near FreeLift routes
may prefer the simplicity of zero-cost FreeLift services. Therefore, to encourage conventional public transit use,
RTD should provide these customers with a free transit pass and a pass for an accompanying personal
attendant if required. This policy is both the right thing to do and is also a more cost-effective Access-a-Ride
alternative for RTD. But the choice is up to the customer: free conventional transit or scheduling an Access-aRide.

Final Report

13.F.a

FreeLift drivers would pick up these customers at their residence, assist them with seating, storing, and later
passenger fee of $8 plus $2 for the personal attendant, if any, plus their $7 base fee. They could continue
picking up other passengers or head to the rail station. The customer could either take a shuttle at their
destination rail station or schedule an Access-a-Cab ride to their final destination.
Some people might consider FreeLift plus free transit passes to be an overly generous benefit. However,
compared to RTD’s average 2019 Access-a-Ride subsidy of $54.55, it is a bargain for RTD—and free for the
customer!

FreeLift for Bus Rapid Transit
Here is how the FreeLift model applies to the
future Longmont-Boulder BRT service. As shown
below, two loops on either side of Main Street
gather riders from surrounding neighborhoods and
feed into Longmont’s First and Main Transit
Station. However, these longer loops are probably
better for SUVs or eight-passenger vans than
cars. This model can also drive BRT ridership by
effectively serving Lafayette, Louisville,
Broomfield, Superior, and other Northwest
Corridor communities.
Note that the Longmont FreeLift loop layout
shown below is just a rough concept and not
meant to reflect any final FreeLift service loops.
Local folks always know best what they need and
how a service such as FreeLift will most efficiently
operate. These loops will also cost RTD less than

RTD’s costs associated with fare collection consist of treasury management and revenue equipment group
costs. In 2019, fare collection costs made up 3.3% ($5,031,800) of total fare revenue and 5.7% ($4,503,327) in
2020 due to decreased farerevenue.
Factors that affect fare collection efficiency include the size and modal composition of the transit agency and
system equipment procurement and updating 18. Factors that maydecrease fare collection costs include fixedcalendar monthly passes, rolling passes (orrechargeable passes), and eliminating local zones 19.
It is typical for transit agencies to spend 5-15% of fare revenue on fare collection. Farecollections costs with
smart card-based fare systems start at levels of around 15% (or $0.15 on the dollar) and reduce these levels to
as low as 6% of fare revenue, contingenton the size of the agency, asset deployment strategies, operational
strategies and laborcontracts 20. Costs of fare collection for Bus Rapid Transit systems typically range from 712% of operating costs 21.
The fare technology company, Masabi conducted a 2019 survey of primarily North American transit agencies,
which showed that about 33% of agencies’ core AutomaticFare Collection systems cost under 10% of their fare
revenue to run 22.
Based on these reports, RTD’s fare collection costs seem to fall within, if not below theexpected range.

Executive Summary
The Regional Transportation District,
commonly referred to as RTD, is the
regional public transit agency
providing services throughout the
greater Denver metropolitan area.
The agency delivers bus, rail,
paratransit and microtransit services
over a 2,342-square-mile area of
3.08 million people. RTD was
created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly and is governed
by a 15-member, publicly elected
Board of Directors.
RTD recognizes the value that a highquality transportation system brings to its
community and the region it serves, and
those that constitute the agency are
committed to delivering service that
supports the needs of its customers,
stakeholders, and community members.
The agency provides vital connections to
makes lives better for those living in and
visiting the Denver metro region in terms
of mobility, access, and environmental
sustainability. RTD is committed to its role
in serving as a vital contributor toward
reducing the region’s overall carbon
footprint, as increasing public transit
usage reduces reliance on single
occupant vehicles, thereby improving
overall air quality.
RTD has been recognized as an industry
leader and innovator as evidenced by its
EAGLE project, the largest public-private
partnership of its kind at its inception, and
the agency’s deployment of nearly 40
battery-electric buses along the 16th Street
Mall in 2018. Coupled with these noteworthy
achievements, RTD has had its fair share of
challenges and has long been criticized for

03

13.F.b

Packet Pg. 174

03

not having clearly defined organizational
strategies, priorities, processes, and the
appearance of transparency. Some of the
criticisms are valid, and there are long-standing
gaps that need to be bridged.
In acknowledgment of these gaps, in July
2020 Governor Jared Polis along with
Representative Matt Gray and Senator Faith
Winter, then chairs of the Colorado General
Assembly’s standing committees responsible
for oversight of transportation matters, created
the Accountability Committee (Committee) with
support from the RTD Board of Directors.
The purpose of the Committee was to provide
an independent and objective analysis of RTD's
operating model and to develop a set of
recommendations to enhance agency
operations and the statutes related to RTD.
The Committee – comprising legislative and
gubernatorial appointees and two ex officio
members from the RTD Board of Directors
and supported by staff assistance from the
Denver Regional Council of Governments –
established three subcommittees to facilitate
discussions around three main focal points:
governance, finance, and operations.
The Committee held its first meeting on August
10, 2020, and met on a regular basis through
its final meeting on July 12, 2021. RTD Board
members and staff attended and participated
in the committee’s meetings, as did RTD’s
General Manager following her appointment
and installation in November 2020.
RTD received the committee’s final report on
July 20, 2021, establishing September 3, 2021,
as the due date for RTD’s response.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

The Committee’s recommendations were
divided into nine general subject matter areas,
with related individual recommendations
grouped within the following headings:
• Spend Federal COVID-19 Relief Funds to
Rebuild Ridership and Improve Operations
• Improve Operator Retention
• Develop Subregional Service Councils
• Explore Board Structure Modifications
Subject to Additional Study and Input
• Explore FasTracks Options
• Improve Reporting Metrics and Transparency
• Improve Fixed-Route and Paratransit
Service Provision
• Leverage Partnerships for Resources
and Services
The Committee made more than 40
recommendations for the betterment of RTD’s
operational efficiency, and the agency agreed
overwhelmingly with the vast majority of these
recommendations.
The single recommendation upon which
there was not alignment centered on the
consolidation of discounted fares to cover
equity populations. RTD is currently conducting
a systemwide fare study and equity analysis,
which will include extensive outreach leveraging
culturally specific community organizations,
including Black, Indigenous, and People of
Color; youth; seniors; people with disabilities;
people experiencing homelessness; veterans;
and LGBTQI+ communities. This 18-month
analysis is anticipated to address the concerns
stated in the recommendation.
In sum, RTD and the Accountability Committee
are aligned on many of the same issues. The
agency welcomes the opportunity to continue
to convene, collaborate, and partner with the
community, customers, regional stakeholders,
and the legislature and the Governor’s office.

Financial Review
Spend Federal COVID-19 Relief
Funds to Rebuild Ridership
and Improve Operations
The more than $700 million RTD will
receive in federal COVID-19 relief
funding provides a revenue source for
RTD to implement the Committee’s
recommendations, in alignment with
federal funding guidance. The
Committee’s recommendations for
spending these funds are targeted at
stabilizing RTD operations, restoring
services, rebuilding trust, attracting new
and returning riders, and helping the
Agency recover from the COVID-19
pandemic. As pandemic restrictions
ease and more employees return to the
workplace, there is an urgent, timelimited opportunity to attract them
to commute via transit before their
post-pandemic behavior is locked into
driving to work in a single-occupant
vehicle instead.

Recommendation 1:
Provide a transparent process and
make priorities clear.
RTD should provide full transparency
during deliberations regarding the use
of these federal dollars so that stakeholders and members of the public can
follow the trade offs, including pros and
cons of the RTD Board’s decisions. RTD
should clearly define its priorities for this
funding, the issues being addressed
by additional funds, and the amount
of funding allocated to each priority.

07

This transparency should continue as
funds are spent so the public can track
expenditures. As there may be a yearend surplus because of these funds, the
Committee requests accountability in
the use of these dollars.

RTD Response: Agree
For RTD’s March 29, 2021, response
to the Committee’s February 12,
2021, COVID-19 Relief Funds
recommendations, see Appendix A.
RTD will continue to communicate, in
public forums, the intended uses of
federal COVID-19 relief grant funding
according to FTA directives regarding
eligible expenditures. RTD will present
this financial information throughout the
budgeting and forecasting processes to
include trade offs under current financial
constraints and also communicate
funding priorities. In addition, RTD will
provide regular updates, in public
forums and on the RTD website,
regarding the status of drawing federal
COVID-19 relief grant funding and for
which eligible expenditures those funds
were applied.

Recommendation 2:
Strategically recall previously laid off
front line employees.
The Committee acknowledges and
supports RTD’s decision to recall
approximately 200 direct-service
employees. However, in keeping with
the above recommendation, RTD
should explain the amount of its federal
stimulus funding allocation needed to

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

Committee Recommendations are in italics and were numbered by RTD.

Packet Pg. 178

03

recall these workers and the amount of
funding remaining to support additional
priorities. The focus of these recalls
should ensure RTD has capacity to
restore quality transit service, particularly
to transit-dependent communities as
quickly as possible.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD will carefully evaluate the human
and financial resources necessary to
restore quality transit service while
ensuring that it meets the needs of
RTD’s customers within the constraining
factors. RTD will continue to be
transparent in presenting budget
appropriations and the supporting
funding sources necessary to meet
those needs.
All represented bus and rail operations
employees were recalled. For rail
operations salaried employees,
60% were reinstated, with remaining
positions requiring further organizational
review and funding.

Recommendation 3:
Share federal funding with other
transit service providers in the
metro area.
There are several non-profit and
community-based transit service
providers in the RTD district. They
supplement RTD’s fixed-route and
paratransit services, often at a cost
lower than RTD could provide for
comparable service. As with RTD,
these providers have been impacted
by reduced ridership and lost revenue

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
would benefit greatly from funding,
where appropriate.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD is committed to collaborating with
its partners on all levels, as evidenced
by the $14 million in funding set aside
in the agency’s FY2021 budget to
implement recommendations made by
the Accountability Committee, the
Office of the State Auditor and peer
review panels convened by the
American Public Transportation
Association to enhance operations
agencywide and to implement
industry best practices.
As the direct recipient of federal
funding, RTD is not legally permitted
to disburse that funding directly but
may apply it toward public transit
expenditures for which it is eligible,
including public transit services that
are contracted with third parties and
first- and last- mile solutions that fall
within the auspices of providing public
transit services.
RTD endeavors to leverage the
qualifying services of non-profit,
community-based and other service
contractors with federal funding,
recognizing the efficiencies that private
sector services may offer, in providing
holistic mobility options to the public
that are within RTD’s purview.

Recommendation 4:
Conduct a six-month pilot to rebuild
ridership and attract new riders via a

08

Packet Pg. 179

02

reduced flat fare for local and regional
routes and free fares for all or some
of the discount groups (youth up to 19
years old, seniors 65+, disabled, and
low income LiVE).
Market it as a simple, affordable, and
easy to understand way to ride RTD
and an incentive to attract returning and
new riders. This will reduce costs for
financially struggling essential workers
who are still riding RTD. During the pilot
program, use this time to explore other
ways to improve affordability of existing
and/or new pass programs, including
LiVE, that can be put in place as a
longer-term solution.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD is currently undertaking a Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis
to investigate and possibly implement
fare changes that would provide several
benefits to RTD customers compared to
the current structure. This evaluation will
consider fare value and a more
simplified fare structure.
Under Title VI regulations of the 1964
Civil Rights Act, RTD is restricted in its
ability to offer “pilot” programs in both
duration and frequency. Route and fare
changes of this nature are required to
undergo a prescribed process, including
an equity analysis.
That said, staff is committed to working
with the Board to explore the
implementation of potential temporary/
promotional fare reductions to
incentivize ridership across the system.
One example of such a promotional

09

opportunity would be “Spare the Air”
days, intended to improve air quality
across the region, by offering free fare
on all RTD services for a single day.
As part of the implementation of
RTD’s Strategic Plan, the agency will
also consider the intent of this
recommendation to attract ridership
and the role it plays in defined
success outcomes.

Recommendation 5:
Help rebuild and increase ridership
by improving uptake and ease of use
of passes.
Allow flexibility in the EcoPass
programs and contracts so that more
neighborhoods and businesses can
participate. For example, allow master
EcoPass contracts to support countywide affordable housing programs and
create more options for businesses to
obtain employee EcoPasses for a
subset of their workers. Consider
discounts for bulk pass purchases.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
recommendation and will further
explore opportunities for pricing
and ease of administration of pass
programs as part of the Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis. The
study will include a robust public
engagement process.
The current pass programs follow
recommendations from a 25-member
pass program working group convened
at the request of RTD’s Board. RTD and

03

many pass customers have experienced
challenges with the current structure.
The utilization pricing structure has
been especially challenging for RTD to
implement and has been a financial
burden on many pass program clients.
Due to the pandemic, RTD has offered
flexible solutions for pass programs. In
2020, staff provided refunds and credits
based on the duration of the rear-door
boarding policy from April through July,
helping organizations remain in the
program. Staff also adjusted contract
totals due to organizations either closing or having a reduction in headcount.
In 2021, staff allowed employers to
exclude remote employees from their
headcount when renewing. The agency
also provided options for them to renew
at the start of the year or renew at a
later date with a prorated contract. Staff
worked with larger employers – those
having 3,000-plus employees –
to adjust pricing based on lowered
headcounts. Staff also worked with the
state to offer alternatives by working
directly with each agency to allow more
flexibility. In addition, the agency worked
with the Auraria Higher Education
Campus to leverage a pilot program
to accommodate the students and
employees traveling to and from
campus. Staff lowered the contract
minimum for the neighborhood EcoPass
program to provide flexibility and
affordability for neighborhoods renewing
later in the year. Staff also updated the
policy to allow an organization
managing multiple properties to include
them all within one contract. In addition,
RTD offers an alternative with its bulk
fare purchase feature through the
RTD mobile ticketing app that many

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

organizations are taking advantage of
as an alternative to a pass program.

Recommendation 6:
Help fund PEAK eligibility technicians/
caseworkers at county HHS
departments to help people through
LiVE enrollment and allow LiVE
applicants to prove eligibility through
verification documents from other
assistance programs (SNAP, WIC, etc.).
Continuing to get the LiVE ID cards in
qualified participant’s hands is essential
and counties can provide this customer
assistance, but need funding to help
support this function.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD hears and understands the desire
for such assistance. The agency currently
provides funding to Denver Human
Services (DHS) for personnel to assist
with LiVE Program customer eligibility
evaluations, customer service and
all aspects of assisting LiVE Program
applicants and customers. Those DHS
employees were hired specifically for
this purpose using RTD funding. RTD
and DHS regularly work with other
governmental and non-profit entities to
train and provide support for their
customers regarding the LiVE Program.
DHS has hired a LiVE Program Outreach
Coordinator – a position funded by RTD
– to assist applicants throughout the
district at partner locations.
RTD will continue to investigate viable
additional services when needed
to assist LiVE Program applicants
and will continue with community
outreach efforts.

Review of State
Performance Audit
Improve Operator Retention
Recommendation 7:
The Operations Subcommittee
assessed and discussed the State
Auditor Report’s findings on operator
retention and human resources.
The report described a series of
recommendations to address and
improve operator retention. The
Committee agrees with the findings
of the report and encourages RTD to
spend federal relief funding to support
the implementation of the proposed
recommendations.
Summary of report recommendations:
• RTD management should take
additional steps to improve supervisory
practices around performance feed		
back to address operator turnover.
• RTD management should improve
its processes to help ensure that bus
operators receive adequate rest
breaks during their work shifts, in
accordance with requirements in
the Union Collective Bargaining 		
Agreement.
• RTD management should improve its
processes for assigning schedules
to operators.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

RTD Response: Agree
RTD is committed to improving its
processes for effectively sourcing and
onboarding candidates and broadening
its retention, recruiting, technology, and
compensation strategies. The following
outlines planned efforts resulting from
an RTD Human Resources workforce
analysis conducted in June 2021:
Retention Efforts
• Training and Development –
Implement tactical and strategical 		
development efforts for all employees.
• Train all frontline supervisors and 		
mid-level managers through courses
on coaching, motivating, and
developing employees; performance
management; and proactive
problem-solving (based on
success outcomes).
• First Year Onboarding Refinement –
Implement functional training tracking
requirements that are scalable.
• Operational Mentorships – Reinforce
Rail and Bus new mentorship
programs designed to help new hires
transition through their first year.
• Retention Incentives – Recognize top
talent with desired behaviors with
on-the-spot incentive awards.
• Recognition Programs – Drive all 		
employees toward internal programs
designed for encouraging each other.

012

Packet Pg. 183

02

Recruiting Efforts
Proactive Sourcing

• Executive leadership fostering
behaviors that are needed to succeed
by “inspecting what is expected.”

• Attract talent by researching the ideal
profiles and engaging with them
directly (Sell).

• Staff leaders at all levels engaging
employees in a positive employee 		
culture and experience.

• Generate leads for pipelining to meet
attrition rates based on top sources
(Plan).

• Meeting new employees and checking
in throughout the onboarding and 		
training process.

• Engage in outreach events to increase
underutilization areas (Track).

Technology Efforts

Tailored Advertising
• Based on existing education source
data and common geographical areas
of current new hires, align efforts with
marketing to ensure that job
advertisement platforms are matching
identified profiles.
• Create niche marketing to strengthen
RTD’s brand. Ask, “Where does
the ideal profile spend their time
the most?”
Involve the Business
Involvement does not stop at attending
job fairs or providing job advertisement sources – it also means engaging
managers and delegates throughout the
recruiting process once a candidate has
been identified. Examples include:
• Engagement communications sent 		
directly from superintendents once a
candidate is invited to RTD information
sessions.
• Supervisors creating excitement when
30/60/90-day milestones are met for
new hires and promotions.

013

Involve key stakeholders in technological
advancement studies that impact how
RTD transports customers.
• What are the trends?
• How long before RTD can adopt new
technology?
• What skills will be necessary to
progress the new technology?
• Who currently possesses the
necessary skills?
• What training will be needed to
transition those without the necessary
skills?
• Where do we find the necessary skills
outside of RTD?
Create a “life-cycle” calculation to
identify legacy technology retiring to 		
stagger talent resources appropriately.
• What technology will be retiring
and when?
• Who currently possesses the
legacy skills?
• How long will it be before the legacy
skills are no longer needed?

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

Packet Pg. 184

03

• Will RTD provide “retention bonuses”
to those with these legacy skills to 		
close out the technology when the
time comes?
Compensation Efforts
RTD will continue to actively assess
and bargain for a variety of options
to optimize employee compensation
consistent with the Collective Bargaining
Agreement with the Amalgamated
Transit Union Local 1001. Recently RTD
and the union agreed to new incentives
for employees taking on additional work
and overtime pay beginning July 11, 2021.
Performance Feedback
RTD agrees with the recommendations
of the Committee and the state auditor
and recognizes that regular and timely
performance feedback is important to
operator development and retention.
Some examples of current strategies
include:
• Implementation of an operator
mentoring program to provide one-on
one assistance on successfully
transitioning into the new position,
guidance and support in meeting 		
goals, and career development.
• Expansion of employee recognition
programs to acknowledge operator
trainees graduations, top performance,
and customer commendations.
• Launch of employee suggestion
hotline to improve communication and
provide employees another avenue to
provide feedback.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

• Update of leadership training for
supervisors to include creating a team
environment of inclusion, celebrating
successes, active listening, emotional
intelligence, and providing
constructive feedback.
• Maximized use of Workday HR
Information System and other tools 		
to increase accessibility of employee
performance information to promote
supervisor feedback.
• Identification of options for providing
focused feedback during regularly
established recertification or
refresher trainings.
• Resumption of supervisor/manager 		
ride checks.
• Increase in visibility of leadership at
all levels consistent with pandemic 		
safety guidelines.
• Development of process for conducting
formal exit interviews to gather and
share information to improve
supervision practices and retention.
Bus Operator Rest Breaks
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
recommendations and the state
auditor’s findings and is committed to
improving processes to ensure that all
operators receive adequate rest breaks
and to minimize fatigue risks consistent
with the Collective Bargaining
Agreement. When situations are
identified with breaks not in compliance,
operations leadership provides operator
access to breaks by adjusting resources
as available. In addition, operations is
working with service planning to
adjust schedules for a permanent fix

014

Packet Pg. 185

02

to the situation. Operators have access
to an operator suggestion form,
and these submissions are sent to
service planning to help inform future
service changes.
Bus Operator Schedules
RTD conveyed its support of the state
auditor’s recommendations in its
December 2020 responses, and the
agency’s management continues to
seek out opportunities to address
operator quality of life issues.
Recognizing that RTD cannot
unilaterally implement all changes, as
some are qualified as work rules and
subject to the collective bargaining
processes, RTD management continues
in good faith to actively identify and
implement solutions agreed upon by
both parties consistent with the
Collective Bargaining Agreement.

015

Some examples of current strategies
include:
• Hiring additional part-time operators
to eliminate split shifts, and assessing
part-time operator flexibility
• Discussing options with union
leadership for adjustments that would
allow for a 15-minute break at the end
of each run
• Refining operator feedback
mechanisms, including the route 		
management program to collect
operator feedback regarding
challenges with bid work and
suggestions for schedule changes,
to address issues related to service
reliability, on-time performance, and
operator quality of life and breaks
• Increasing communications with
operators to ensure that all employees
are aware of benefits available to 		
them that are designed to improve 		
work life balance, such as the
Employee Assistance Program (EAP)

Governance and
Executive Leadership
Develop Subregional
Service Councils
The RTD Accountability Committee
believes that RTD should have a
more collaborative decision-making
structure to increase input from
local communities.

Recommendation 8:
Revise RTD’s transit service planning
process by establishing subregional
service councils. Service councils will
have responsibility for developing
and recommending “local” transit
service plans for the RTD Board’s
consideration. The Committee believes
the introduction of this concept will:
• Improve collaboration between RTD
and the communities it serves.
• Increase opportunities for public input
through locally accessible forums.
• Advance social equity goals by
developing community-based transit
plans that identify transportation and
service gaps, especially in low income
and minority neighborhoods.
• Promote innovative mobility solutions
at a local level consistent with the
RTD Board’s overall service goals
and objectives.
• Provide an opportunity to address 		
geographic equity and rebuild trust 		
and transparency with constituents.

017

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
objective of increasing community
collaboration in service planning and
is committed to rebuilding trust and
transparency with constituents. RTD
values and appreciates customer
feedback, as it enables the agency
to plan services to best meet customers’
needs. Moreover, collaboration in
an earnest manner yields an optimal
service delivery model by garnering an
understanding of the customers’ pain
points and identifying solutions through
a humanistic approach. In that spirit
of collaboration, RTD will establish a
working group of stakeholders to make
recommendations regarding the
purpose, role, operation, composition,
and boundary concept model of the
service councils. RTD will continue to
evaluate ways to enhance the stakeholder listening session model to
ensure that social equity remains at the
forefront of service discussions and
decisions with Title VI as a basis.
As part of RTD’s enhanced approach to
stakeholder engagement, the agency
in early 2021 implemented stakeholder
listening sessions as part of the
service change process that occurs
three times a year. These sessions
provide an opportunity for RTD staff to
solicit input that is considered in the
development of the draft service plans
that are presented to the RTD Board.

03

Recommendation 9:
Membership: The Committee
recommends service councils be
representative of the community-atlarge. Service council membership
shall include:
• Elected representatives, or their
designee, from each city/town/county
within each council district.
• A broad spectrum of community
interests and geography to ensure
social, economic, financial, and
environmental equity considerations
are represented.
• Transit Users: residents who live,
work, or attend school within the 		
council district.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees that service planning and
development must ensure that a broad
spectrum of customer voices and
stakeholders are heard and that local
service plans should reflect, to the
extent feasible and in keeping with
good transit planning principles
including equity, the priorities of the
communities and other stakeholders.
RTD will establish a working group of
stakeholders to make recommendations
regarding the membership on
the councils.
RTD makes service adjustments three
times per year and values receiving and
evaluating feedback from its customers,
to ensure that the system is serving the
public to the greatest extent possible.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

The agency holds public hearings to
introduce proposed service changes
and collect responses from customers and stakeholders. This process is
open to the public and includes elected
officials and community stakeholders.
Comments are collected via phone, fax,
email, and in-person or virtual meetings.
RTD implemented a new stakeholder
engagement process in early 2021 to
enhance the opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback about service
needs and adjustments before a draft
service plan is presented for public
comment.
Stakeholder listening sessions are
hosted prior to the development of
service adjustments to collect input and
information as transit needs evolve.
These sessions are hosted within five
geographic sectors based on travel
patterns within the RTD service area.
Currently, mayors or their designees,
county commission chairs or their
designees, city and county staff most
engaged and informed about RTD service needs, and leaders of all regional
transportation management organizations and associations are invited to the
listening sessions. RTD holds additional
listening sessions with key stakeholder
groups that include major school
and university groups and local
coordinating councils.
The new stakeholder listening session
process has been working well, and
RTD staff continues to evaluate and
adjust it as necessary. This format will
include representation from various
customer segments and be expanded
to include dialogue about key, relevant
transportation topics.

018

Recommendation 10:

RTD Response: Agree

Districts: The Committee recommends
RTD establish a working group of
regional stakeholders to comprehensively evaluate the following two
service council boundary concepts to
ascertain the best fit for the Denver
region. The working group shall
consider the role and purpose of the
service councils, community cohesion
and RTD staff resources in its analysis.

RTD agrees with the Committee’s
recommendation to establish a working
group of regional stakeholders to
consider the role and purpose of service
councils and to evaluate the two
council boundary concepts of county
boundaries and travel shed. The
working group is paramount in the
process of finding optimal solutions, in
that discussions should be had so that
pain points can be identified and
solutions addressed through a
comparison of boundary models.

• County Boundaries: The RTD service
area encompasses wholly or partially
Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and 		
Jefferson counties. The establishment
of service councils based on this 		
pre-determined geo-political boundary
would appear logical since local
governments residing in the same
county already have a familiarity with
each other. Additionally, county-based
service councils would be consistent
with the already established DRCOG
subregional forums which are utilized
for transportation planning and
funding decisions.
• Travel Shed: A valuable tool for
visualizing and analyzing mobility 		
patterns. In the Denver region, known
travel behavior makes this concept a
viable option particularly if fewer
service districts is the objective.

019

Recommendation 11:
RTD Resource Allocation:
The Committee acknowledges the
critical role RTD plays in fulfilling
the mobility needs of Denver area
residents. Understandably, taxpayers
are interested in having more information of how their tax dollars are being
used to create an equitable transit
system. As a result, the Committee
recommends RTD develop and submit
to the subregional service councils an
annual report illustrating how the revenues generated in each subregion are
used to provide transportation “value”
to the residents of the subregion.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD currently produces an annual
report that details allocation of revenue
and expenses by county across the
eight counties within the RTD
boundaries. RTD is an integrated transit
system that crosses multiple jurisdiction
boundaries across 2,342 square miles
and uses resources that are centralized
or cannot be accurately attributed to
specific geographic areas. Following the
subregional council workgroup’s
recommendations, RTD will consider
producing a report illustrating how it
provides value to subregion residents,
as well as to the district and state as
a whole.
RTD’s 2021-26 Strategic Plan
(see Appendix B) highlights a
commitment to providing value to RTD
customers as well as to the broader
Denver metro region, and includes
Community Value as a strategic priority.
Beginning in 2022, quarterly reports
will be available for tracking this
success outcome.

RTD Board of Directors

by an independent body with input from
regional stakeholders.

Explore Board Structural
Modifications Subject to
Additional Study and Input

Recommendation 12:

The structure of the Board of Directors
differs from some peer agencies.
The Committee believes a deeper
exploration should be pursued after
Subregional Councils are implemented.
The Committee acknowledges a lack
of consensus on how the structure of
the RTD Board affects the effectiveness
of its decision making, neither is there
clarity on the existence of a problem
with the Board’s structure nor what that
problem may be. In addition, the
Committee is making a series of
recommendations (e.g., Subregional
Service Councils) which, if implemented,
may impact Board operations. Finally,
the RTD Board is proactively making
changes to the structure of its
Subcommittees and the organization
has appointed a new General Manager,
both of which present opportunities for
modifying the functionality of the Board.
When coupled with these changes,
the finding that RTD’s Board structure
differs from most other transit agencies
is not sufficient for developing recommendations, as they simply note areas
of differences and commonalities, as
opposed to effectiveness. Therefore,
it would be premature to develop
recommendations for future Board
structures and the Committee suggests
further study and analysis be completed

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

Specifically, the Committee recommends the following course of action:
• Following a reasonable period of time
for the Committee recommendations
to be implemented and results seen
(e.g., two years), investigate the
effectiveness of RTD’s Board structure.
In partnership with regional
stakeholders, evaluate the historical
context of RTD’s Board structure,
define Board effectiveness, success
and efficiency, and evaluate past
Boards’ records for meeting these
criteria. Determine whether and
where problem(s) exists, and if so,
develop a problem statement and
recommended solution. If a problem
does not exist or inefficiencies are not
found, the RTD Board structure should
remain unchanged.
• Where problems are identified or in
instances where the Board could be
operating more efficiently, conduct
a deep and thorough study of RTD’s
Board structure in comparison with
peer transit agencies and other
agencies within the region. Further 		
examine the findings in this
assessment and develop an
understanding of the impacts the
implementation of any Committee 		
recommendations.

022

Packet Pg. 193

02

• Based on the findings of the study,
determine if a new Board structure
would better serve both RTD and the
region’s constituents. If so, outline a
new Board structure, including roles
and responsibilities, and revise the
by-laws if necessary.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
finding that there is no consensus on
whether there is a problem to solve with
respect to the current Board structure.
The agency looks forward to collaborating
with the Office of the State Auditor
(OSA), as part of OSA’s 2024-2025 audit
program, as it reviews the agency’s
progress on the implementation of
the Accountability Committee’s
recommendations.

023

Moreover, the Strategic Plan includes
four strategic priorities: Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success,
which will serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and
measure the agency’s performance
through oversight via its committee
structure and overarching governance.
Further, the agency recognizes the
importance of the role of the democratic
process in the overall governance of the
agency by way of the people’s ability to
select the Board’s elected leaders,
who are directly accountable to their
constituencies.

Resource Prioritization
Review and
Financial Stability

Range Rail Commission, and the
Colorado Department of Transportation,
the goal of which is to work toward a
plan for passenger rail service along the
Northwest Rail Alignment.

Northwest Rail/Unfinished FasTracks

Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR)
currently has three alignments through
Denver. Two of these alignments affect
two RTD projects – Northwest Rail and
North Metro. RTD will presents its
analysis of pros and cons of both
alignments for consideration. RTD will
pursue all reasonable partnership
opportunities with the FRPR project,
to leverage investments and services.
RTD has begun engaging in
partnership efforts.

Explore FasTracks Options
The four unfinished FasTracks corridors,
Northwest Rail in particular, pose a
significant financial and operating
challenge for RTD. These recommendations provide opportunities to explore
achievable options while continuing to
keep commitments to voters.

Recommendation 13:
The Committee supports the Northwest
Rail alignment for the Front Range
Passenger Rail (FRPR) corridor
and recommends RTD pursue all
reasonable partnership opportunities
with the FRPR project. This route not
only appears to provide significant
benefits for the FRPR project but also
offers an opportunity to leverage
investments and services to support
Northwest Rail.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD is committed to exploring all viable
avenues for the completion of the
unfinished FasTracks corridors, as
evidenced by the Board’s recent
adoption in August 2021 of the
Cooperation Agreement among the
agency, Southwest Chief, the Front

025

Recommendation 14:
RTD should work with local
jurisdictions and DRCOG to explore
opportunities for transit-oriented
development and other strategies to
increase projected ridership on the
unfinished corridors.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD will continue to work with DRCOG
and jurisdictions on local planning
efforts around stations to encourage
development in the vicinity of the
unfinished corridors. RTD will encourage
higher densities, walkability, a variety of
access routes serving all modes (e.g.,
pedestrian, bike, auto, scooter), and
forward-thinking zoning. However, RTD
does not have land use authority and
can only encourage transit supportive
land use policy.

Recommendation 15:
RTD should investigate opportunities
to increase non-RTD resources for
transit stations including local
cost sharing, grants, tax increment
financing, or public-private
partnerships.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD has used most of the above
strategies on past projects and
will continue to work with local
jurisdictions and others to pursue
non-RTD resources for project
implementation and ongoing operations
and maintenance. Reimagine RTD will
establish a framework for partnerships
so that local governments and other
entities garner an understanding of
RTD’s process and requirements for
partnering with RTD.
RTD regularly seeks additional funding
opportunities and will continue to do
so. The agency recently applied for a

Rebuilding American Infrastructure
with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE)
planning grant to aid in the planning
of the Northwest Rail Peak Service
Study. Seeking additional funding
opportunities must fall within RTD’s
authority under enabling legislation
and other laws, including Taxpayer Bill
of Rights restrictions.

Recommendation 16:
RTD should perform a complete and
comprehensive analysis of the
Northwest Rail project to establish a
common set of assumptions (including
cost, ridership and timeline), and
then engage in a regional discussion
about opportunities and alternatives,
both near-term and long-term, for
the corridor.

RTD Response: Agree
This effort is currently underway. In
February 2021, RTD staff briefed the
Board on the current status of

026

Packet Pg. 197

02

Northwest Rail (NWR) as part of the
overall FasTracks program. At that
time, the Board supported staff’s
recommendation to work with
jurisdictional stakeholders to develop an
operating plan and budget to provide a
Peak level of rail service to the corridor.
Since February, several engagement
sessions have been held with
jurisdictional stakeholders of the
northwest region, and multiple
presentations have been made to the
Board regarding a comprehensive
NWR Peak Service Study that will
address different operational scenarios,
viable vehicle technologies, fleet and
infrastructure needs, lifecycle costing,
risk and mitigation strategies,
operational rights within the BNSF
corridor, and independent capital and
operating cost estimates to support
Peak Service Operations.
The proposed study will support a clear
understanding of the first phase of the
commitment to deliver the Northwest
Rail as outlined in the 2004 FasTracks
plan. It will consider the potential future
integration of NWR and the Front Range
Passenger Rail from Boulder to Longmont. The study will include extensive,
robust community outreach. RTD plans
to use the study deliverables as part of
future contracts in connection with any
property acquisition, key agreements,
and design and construction should
funding become available to implement
NWR Peak Service. This comprehensive
study is planned to be complete by the
end of 2023.

027

To help complete this study, RTD plans
to contract with a consultant group to
conduct a Planning and Environmental
Linkages (PEL) study. RTD has been
working with jurisdictional stakeholders
to develop a scope of work. Staff is
seeking formal approval from the RTD
Board of Directors to transfer funds from
the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
for the study. RTD is working toward
having this consultant team, which will
integrate the work of multiple parties, on
board by the end of 2021.

Recommendation 17:
RTD should work with CDOT and
DRCOG to implement Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) projects in the northwest
region, beginning with SH 119, as
identified in the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) and the DRCOG
2050 Regional Transportation Plan.
In any scenario, RTD needs to pay
down its debt before it can build and
operate Northwest Rail. In the interim,
RTD should negotiate with the
communities of the Northwest Corridor
on how to provide more immediate
mobility to the region, such as
accelerating expansion of Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT), while continuing to
evaluate Northwest Rail options.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD is collaborating with DRCOG,
CDOT, cities, and counties to implement
the Regional Bus Rapid Transit Feasibility
Study. RTD has committed $30 million
for the implementation of BRT in the
SH 119 corridor and is currently working
with CDOT on advancing design.

and Transparency

Recommendation 18:
RTD should take steps to provide
prominent, accessible and easy-tounderstand financial and performance
information for the public, stakeholders,
partners, and elected officials.
Service Performance
Operational Effectiveness
Increase ridership
• Percent boarding change by mode
Provide dependable service
• Percent of on-time performance
by mode
• Percent of employee vacancies
Ensure fleet reliability
• Percent of vehicles over their
useful life

RTD Response: Agree
System ridership and line-level
performance will continue to be listed
and enhanced with reports provided
to the Board of Directors and listed
published on the RTD website. Boarding
data will be listed and compared with
relevant time periods to provide
clear and meaningful depictions of
performance.

029

With regard to fleet reliability and the
percent of vehicles over their useful life,
RTD currently uses the manufacturer/
Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
recommendation of 12 years or 500,000
miles as the useful life benchmark in
its asset management program for all
fixed-route vehicles and 5 years for all
non-fixed-route revenue vehicles. RTD
is developing a cost- and data-based
replacement process for all vehicles that
will allow the agency to build a strong
replacement strategy. This information
can be leveraged in the development of
a public-facing web portal to showcase
RTD’s progress.

Recommendation 19:
Operational Efficiency
Efficiently manage finances
• Operating cost recovery ratio
• Percent change in fare revenue
• Percentage of cost per mile as
compared to peer agencies
Achieve outstanding financial
performance
• Bond Rating

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD regularly evaluates service
performance for operational efficiency
and adjusts services three times or
more annually as necessary.
RTD regularly achieves outstanding
financial performance within RTD’s con-

trol and generally only has the ability
to respond to, and not foresee
or prevent, external factors such as
economic downturns, pandemic
impacts, and legislation. RTD has
received the Government Finance
Officers Association (GFOA) Certificate
of Achievement for Excellence in
Financial Reporting for 28 consecutive
years. RTD has been effective at
implementing innovative financial
solutions to complete many expansion
projects, has refinanced debt for
interest savings, has pursued many
other opportunities for efficiencies, and
will continue to do so.
RTD was responsive and successful
in addressing the significant
unprecedented impacts of COVID-19
by reducing expenditures while also
ensuring employee and customer
safety and continuing to provide vital
public transit services. The FTA has
verified that RTD has adhered to all
fiscal requirements.
As RTD implements its Strategic Plan
and identifies strategic priorities and
success outcomes, measurement tools
will be implemented.
Pertaining to RTD conducting a study
and benchmarking against peer
agencies, specifically the metric for cost
per mile, there is no current industry
standard for whole life cost or cost per
mile. RTD asset management and
vehicle maintenance are currently
working on developing an ISO
55000-based whole life cost/cost per
mile model that will enable RTD to
compare cost per mile to peer agencies.

This project is expected to be completed
by the second quarter of 2022.

Recommendation 20:
Customer Experience
Provide an excellent rider experience
• Percent of time passengers are in
crowded conditions
• Average facility and vehicle
cleanliness complaints per month
• Overall customer satisfaction and/or
net promoter score
Engage with customers
• Call answer rate efficiency (in seconds)
• Average time to resolve
customer issues

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees that monitoring key
performance metrics and providing
accessible performance information on
the customer experience is critical.
RTD has recently converted to a new
customer relationship management
(CRM) system through the Salesforce
Service Cloud platform. Staff is now
able to capture and report customer
comments, commendations, and
complaints in a much easier fashion.
Statistics related to service quality and
issue resolution are shared quarterly
with the RTD Board of Directors. These
data can be reformatted using Microsoft
Business Intelligence (BI) software to
enable the public to more easily access
the information.

030

Packet Pg. 201

02

With the recent conversion to
Salesforce, staff also has enhanced
reporting capabilities that can support
publication of service quality-related
statistics such as these via a reporting
page on the RTD website. Data on
crowding is not available for 100% of
the vehicle fleet at this time (it is
available on 70% of the bus fleet and
100% of light rail and commuter rail
vehicles). Staff is revising the process to
capture and report customer feedback
in a more holistic fashion. Customer
Excellence is a strategic priority in the
agency’s new Strategic Plan, which
encompasses customer engagement
and enhancing the customer
experience. Moreover, the success
outcome for the Customer Excellence
priority for 2022 is to establish a
baseline for the Customer Net Promoter
Score and to increase that number
by 5%.

Recommendation 21:
Community Engagement
At this time, metrics capturing the
success of community engagement are
not proposed. While the Committee
prioritized this metric area, there are
insufficient peer examples from which
to draw. Below is a list of stretch metrics
that may be considered at a later time
when there is a better understanding
of what success would look like and/or
data becomes available:
• Positive contribution to the region
• Percent increase in positive public
impressions (multi-media)
• Number of successful partnerships

031

RTD Response: Agree
As part of the agency’s recent strategic
planning process, key metrics and
tactics have been developed to support
strategic priorities and the achievement
of success outcomes. The communications department has outlined several
activities to enhance community
and stakeholder engagement and
metrics to measure the effectiveness
of those activities.
Community engagement efforts serve a
number of purposes for RTD, including
establishing relationships, providing
educational opportunities, recruiting
new customers and enriching the
experience of existing customers,
informing and soliciting feedback or
comment, and creating a positive image.
The metrics for each of these purposes
vary and are embedded in the goals
and desired outcome of the outreach.
In the community engagement/outreach
realm, it is often difficult to measure the
impact of activities and the positive
influence they have on target audiences.
The current practice is to collaborate
with regional partners to expand the
reach of RTD’s communication and
engagement efforts. Community engagement performed directly by RTD
is monitored and measured to determine effectiveness toward the intended
goal on a case-by-case basis. Primary
measures of success may include the
number of target audience members
reached, the quality of information
exchanged, the amount of input or
comments received, and the volume of
questions or concerns addressed.

The Committee noted that the metrics
outlined above, while measurable and
applicable, do not capture the full spirit
and importance of measuring equity and
accessibility. As such, stretch metrics
have been identified for further consideration. These stretch metrics will
require a clear definition of terminology
and success. In some cases, these
metrics may require access to data that
is not currently available:
• Percent of minority/low-income people
with access to the system
• Percent of households within a
10-minute walk or roll of high-quality
mobility options (consider how
affordable housing may also be
incorporated)

The Subcommittee noted that the metric
outlined above, while measurable and
applicable, does not capture the extent
to which RTD is impacting the regional
environment. As such, stretch metrics
have been identified for further consideration. These stretch metrics will
require a clear definition of terminology
and success. In some cases, these
metrics may require access to data that
is not currently available. It would also
be helpful to use metrics that show how
RTD is contributing to alreadyestablished regional, statewide, and
federal metrics on ozone and
greenhouse gas emission reductions.

• Average wait time by service mode

• Pound of seasonal air pollutant
prevented (NOX in summer and PM
2.5 in winter)

• Average number of transfers per trip

• Total facility energy use

• Calls answered for paratransit

032

02

RTD Response:
Partially Agree
RTD shares the Accountability
Committee’s passion for environmental
stewardship. The agency is committed
to its role in serving as a vital contributor
toward the reduction of the region’s
overall carbon footprint. Increasing
ridership on public transit reduces the
number of cars on the road, which in
turn reduces fuel consumption and
vehicle emissions per passenger mile
and improves overall air quality.
According to the American Public
Transportation Association, when
compared with single-occupancy
vehicles, public transportation
produces 95% less carbon dioxide,
92% fewer volatile organic compounds,
45% less carbon dioxide, and 48% less
nitrogen oxide.
RTD will evaluate and consider each of
the recommended metrics for reporting purposes as the RTD Strategic Plan
is implemented, consistent with the
identified strategic priorities, success
outcomes and metrics.
All RTD fixed-route vehicles are clean
burning diesel or electric. Both types of
vehicles are considered "low emission."
All other vehicles meet the emission
standards for the year when they were
manufactured. RTD, in partnership with
others, also monitors its impact on
regional air quality by removing vehicles from the road and reducing traffic
congestion.

033

Further, RTD will consider and evaluate
environmental impacts through the employment of specific tactics and metrics
as the agency embraces Community
Value as one of its four strategic priorities and will advocate for environmental
stewardship among the priorities in the
agency’s legislative agenda.

Recommendation 24:
Safety
Operate a safe system
• Number of preventable accidents per
100,000 miles
• Number of signal violations
Keep employees safe
• Number of reported employee
equipment accidents
Keep the system secure
• Offenses per 100,000 riders
• Average response time to emergency
dispatch calls

RTD Response: Agree
Operations will work in collaboration
with safety to implement these
performance reports.
As part of the Strategic Plan, staff has
created metrics and actions that reduce
the number of preventable vehicle accidents and reduce on-the-job injuries.
RTD agrees that its safety and security
divisions must ensure the safety and
security of employees and customers.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

Packet Pg. 204

03

RTD is currently working to address
these issues by committing to the
following:

remain available for the public, RTD
should create (and update quarterly)
the following:

• Leveraging a dedicated crime and
safety data analyst to focus on the
collection of information that will be
used to provide smarter and more 		
focused deployments in the field.

• A basic budget document (ideally in
a one-sheet format). This should be
a high-level summary document that
contains revenues and expenses by
category in relation to the current
adopted budget. (provide link defining
key terms)

• Using emergency management to
assure internal and regional
coordinated response to critical
incidents and natural disasters.
• Conduct a systemwide safety-focused
threat and vulnerability assessment to
address impactful methods of
reducing preventable injuries and 		
accidents.
Use data to expand the level of safety
staffing required to consistently work
with managers across divisions, with
a focus on implementing RTD’s safety
management systems and Public
Transportation Agency Safety Plan.

Recommendation 25:
Provide a simplified version of
financial budget information that
includes a simple one-page budget
document that is more accessible to
the general public and easy to follow.
Consider use of public focus groups
to help craft content and format.
Currently, RTD’s website provides a
great deal of financial information which
is challenging to sift through and
understand. While this amount of
detailed financial information may be
useful in some situations and should

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

• Capital project schedule and
expenditure information, updated
at least quarterly.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD currently provides a great deal
of information in the interest of public
transparency and recognizes that it can
be provided in a more succinct and
user-friendly fashion, more easily
understood by the diverse audiences
using this information.
RTD will develop the information to
be presented in a more user-friendly
dashboard format that also reflects
key measurements, tracking success
outcomes in relation to RTD’s
strategic direction.

Recommendation 26:
Provide explanatory information on
RTD’s budget and the process it uses
to form and finalize this budget.
Even in a basic format, financial
information can be difficult to interpret.
By supplementing the above

034

Packet Pg. 205

02

recommendation with a high-level
summary “translation” of the budget in
easily understood language, RTD can
help improve the lay person’s grasp
of the information. Alternative formats,
such as videos, also provide viable
options. A layperson’s overview of the
budget itself would be useful,
including available revenue streams,
primary expense categories, and defining terminology such as “Base System”
and “Farebox Revenue.” This is also
an opportunity to explain the fact that
fares do not cover the full cost of a ride,
which is a common mis-perception. RTD
should provide the following:

Given the public interest in and scrutiny
of the FasTracks program, RTD can
improve upon the availability of public
access to up-to-date financial information by enhancing its well-developed
FasTracks website to provide this data.
The updated information should
describe the FasTracks Internal Savings
Account (FISA), how it is used, and any
additional resources that help
stakeholders and the public understand
the status of FasTracks projects. In
developing this content, RTD should be
mindful of public awareness when using
undefined terms such as “FasTracks,”
“Base System,” etc.

• A description of the budget adoption
process and the role of the Board
of Directors.

RTD Response: Partially Agree

• A description of how the budget aligns
with RTD’s mission and performance
objectives.

RTD Response: Agree
• See response to recommendation
No. 25

Recommendation 27:
Include financial information on
FasTracks that is easy to follow.

035

RTD currently provides a great deal
of information in the interest of public
transparency for FasTracks and will
continue to update specific information
as warranted.
While FasTracks is an RTD capital
expansion program, those efforts are
part of an integrated transit system.
RTD’s intent is to disabuse the notion
that its base system and FasTracks are
separate or have competing interests,
and that together they will continue to
provide excellence for the entire RTD
family of services.

received by RTD from the CARES Act
and CRRSAA has totaled over $430
million. The Agency is also expected to
receive a third allotment from the most
recent stimulus package. RTD should
provide a quarterly report with a full
accounting on the use of these funds as
well as share its priorities for the third
allotment, especially as these funds
exceed what is needed to cover base
operations (including personnel costs).
Materials should explain restrictions
on stimulus dollars (what they can and
cannot be used for) and should provide,
where relevant, a connection to the
Committee’s recommendations
regarding the use of additional federal
relief funds.

This funding is not “stimulus” funding
and is not new money available for new
initiatives, as is evident in the eligible
expenditures promulgated by the FTA
as well as the terms “relief” and
“rescue” in the titles of each of the
apportionments. Rather, it is relief
funding provided in response to the
significant declines in ridership and
revenues experienced from COVID-19,
with the intent to sustain vital public
transit services.
The future state of public transit and
continued funding is far from certain,
and RTD will continue to efficiently
apply this funding to sustain public
transit services and maintain existing
taxpayer public transit investments in
a state of good repair.

RTD Response: Partially Agree

RTD agrees to continue to provide
transparent reporting regarding the
intended use and actual grant draws
of COVID-19 relief funding in a
timeframe that is relevant to emerging
issues that arise rather than simply on
a quarterly basis.

Service Delivery

Improve Fixed-route and
Paratransit Service Provision
Recommendation 29:
The Committee recommends the
following actions to improve fixedroute and paratransit service provision:
Accessibility + Infrastructure
Improve accessibility at light rail
and fixed-route stops. Proposed
solutions include:
• Zero-stair entrance at transit stations.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
recommendation and is committed to
continuously identifying opportunities
for improving accessibility for all
customers. Further, the agency
recognizes the importance of
collaborating with its jurisdictional
partners to work toward enhancement
of access in areas adjacent to RTD’s
stations, stops, and platforms.
All light rail facilities meet or exceed
the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Access is provided
via walkways, ramps, stairs, elevators,
escalators, and light rail boarding high
blocks. RTD has 9,702 fixed-route stops
on the streets controlled by the

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) and local cities and counties.
RTD does not have auspices over
the sidewalk or the property. RTD
collaborates with local jurisdictions to
make each new or relocated fixed-route
stop accessible. The agency also
provides technical assistance in
designing and constructing accessible
bus stops, and it actively seeks grant
funding and partnerships to advance
this effort. Recently, RTD received a
Safer Main Streets grant from CDOT
that will advance this effort.
• Standardize wayfinding signage and
directional grooved pavement,
ensuring some level of consistency 		
across similarly designed stations to
ensure people who are blind can
navigate transit stations.
• Improve audio announcement systems
to assist those in the blind community.
• Identify a list of accessibility
improvements with disability and 		
mobility advocates and seek funding
to implement these projects, including
federal infrastructure dollars as they
become available.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD recognizes that promoting
consistency to the extent possible
across its stations supports the ability
of customers with disabilities to
navigate transit stations. RTD will
reevaluate the wayfinding signage
criteria for the visually impaired
communities. RTD last looked at the
directional grooved pavement issue in
2018 and 2019, in partnership with the

038

Packet Pg. 209

02

city and county of Denver for the 16th
Street Mall reconstruction. RTD also
reviewed this matter over five years
ago, and no consensus was reached
at that time with the blind community
about what measures to deploy. RTD
will conduct community outreach to
reevaluate whether visually impaired
communities have a strong preference
for any particular solution and to
understand their pain points and issues.
RTD will continue to check if any
existing systems on vehicles and
within public facilities are not operating
as designed. Desired improvements
can vary in scope and complexity to
implement, along with associated
financial implications. The time to
implement any proposed improvements
will also vary with the complexity.

RTD will continue to
work in partnership
with CDOT and local
jurisdictions to make
each new or relocated
fixed-route stop accessible. RTD uses aerial
imagery and site visits
to determine the initial
placement of bus stops.
As mentioned, RTD has
9,702 fixed-route stops
on the streets and does
not have control over
the sidewalk or the
property. Some streets
do not have sidewalks.

039

• Using existing survey data, work
in partnership with municipalities
to standardize and improve bus
stop placement to ensure
greater accessibility.

RTD Response: Agree
Bus Stop placement is affected by
many factors: route efficiency, network
connectivity, safety, adjacent land uses,
the roadway geometry and traffic speed,
traffic signalization, land available, and
slope of the area. Property owners
sometimes advocate against having a
bus stop in front of their property. Local
jurisdictions issue the permits for work
on bus stops and are closely involved in
the process.
RTD has standardized bus stops
designs that are published in the
RTD Bus Infrastructure Standard
Drawings 2016. An extract is below:

Recommendation 31:

Multimodal Transportation

Service Delivery

Work with micro-mobility partners and
municipalities to ensure transit stations
have diverse mobility options (e-bikes,
scooters and other multi-modal devices
including 3- and 4-wheel for people with
mobility issues) to provide customers
the last-mile connection.

• As Reimagine RTD continues its work,
have this advisory body focus its 		
redesign efforts on prioritizing the 		
travel needs of frequent transit users,
including bus rapid transit.

RTD Response: Agree

The Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan emphasizes service
to essential workers and customers who
have continued to use RTD’s services
throughout the pandemic. RTD will
continue to work to serve the travel
needs of all its customers, including
those with different needs and abilities.
The agency works to maximize service
to all current and potential customers,
and it has conducted studies to prioritize the development of bus rapid
transit corridors. RTD will use a universal
design philosophy.

RTD Response: Agree

RTD will continue to actively work
with micromobility partners and
municipalities to improve first- and
last-mile connections to RTD facilities.
Notable projects already completed
or in progress include: stenciled
micromobility parking areas at many
RTD stations, with operators
encouraged to locate scooters and
e-bikes in these areas; and an FTA
Accelerating Innovative Mobility (AIM)
grant, which will integrate multimodal
trip planning and fare payment with an
e-scooter operator in Denver. RTD

RTD Response: Agree
RTD will continue to work with municipalities to pursue transit-only lanes on
major routes. Denver has designated
several exclusive bus lanes downtown.
RTD does not have jurisdiction over
land use, but it works in collaboration
with local jurisdictions to encourage
station area master planning. While
RTD does not work directly with anchor
institutions, it works with jurisdictions
and local municipalities that traditionally
coordinate these efforts.
RTD encourages transit-oriented
development (TOD) both at and
adjacent to its stations, and it has staff
dedicated to this effort. RTD staff
coordinate with jurisdictions to support
transit-supportive land use, as well as
with private developers to encourage
density at stations and reduce parking
ratios. Development around stations has
been significant in recent years; within
a half-mile walk of high frequency
stations, there are 50,000 residential
units, 11 million square feet of office

041

space, 1.5 million square feet of retail
space, and over 4,000 hotel rooms.
In February 2021, the RTD Board
approved an equitable TOD policy that
encourages affordable housing
development on RTD land by offering
affordable projects greater flexibility.
• Support limited access for pick- up by
on-demand services like Taxi, Uber,
Lyft and others that are providing
transportation for those with
disabilities. Designated areas at the
station would help provide a seamless
connection for transit riders.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD stations are designed with a
“Kiss-n-Ride” area, designed for public
access for picking and dropping off
customers. Taxis, Uber/Lyft, and other
transportation providers have this area
available to them, as does the general
public. RTD will assess the feasibility of
designated spaces by July 2022 and
will evaluate access for individuals with
disabilities for access to pickup areas.

Partnerships
Leverage Partnerships for
Resources and Services
Partnerships with local governments,
non-profits, business, and institutions
offer opportunities to leverage and
expand RTD resources and services.

Recommendation 32:
Leverage existing and new partnerships to improve service efficiency and
grow ridership. RTD should emphasize
partnerships with local governments,
anchor institutions, transportation
management organizations (TMOs) and
employers or employment centers who
have a unique understanding of local
mobility needs.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
recommendation and is proud to be a
key partner in the regional collaboration
model the Denver metro area is
recognized for nationally. RTD is
committed to continuing to bolster and
build partnerships, which will be key to
meeting current and future transit needs
and connecting customers to the places
they want and need to go.
RTD is in the process of developing a
clear and streamlined process by
which local governments, anchor
institutions, transportation management
organizations, non-profits, and others
can submit partnership requests. This
will encourage innovation in how

043

service is delivered while establishing
a consistent process and transparent
criteria for review of all partnerships.
This process can potentially be
applied to all partnerships in which
RTD engages.

Recommendation 33:
Incentivize communities to enter
cost-sharing arrangements with RTD
to provide new or existing local transit
solutions in an effort to minimize
service gaps and increase ridership.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD supports partnerships that use
grant or local funds to expand service
to customers and communities without
negative impacts to existing service.
Fiscal constraints would limit the
success of such efforts and potentially
tip the balance of service equity toward
more affluent communities, as RTD
would need to shift funding away
from existing service to fund such
partnerships.
It is more common that RTD fully fund
and operate service in cooperation with
groups that are not local governments,
non-profits, business, and institutions.
RTD is committed to continuing to better
understand the transit needs of the
communities it serves and will continue
to foster collaborative efforts to improve
access to transit service throughout
the district.

Recommendation 34:
Explore opportunities to provide
cost-effective local transportation
services through collaboration with
existing mobility service providers
(e.g., Via, Uber, Lyft) in areas where
traditional fixed-route service may
not be the most appropriate mobility
solution. Also, explore opportunities to
contract with other third-party providers
that may specialize in a particular service (e.g., paratransit) at a reduced cost.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD is committed to continuing to
explore collaboration opportunities with
current and new third-party service
providers. RTD currently contracts with
Via for paratransit services. RTD
supported Via’s assumption of the
Seniors’ Resource Center (SRC) in 2021
to help maintain continuity of service.
RTD’s paratransit program has
contracted with Uber to pilot an
on-demand service to provide service
for same-day trips. RTD is developing
a request for proposal (RFP) for 2022
service that will allow for the inclusion
of any transportation network company
(TNC), taxi or non-emergency medical
transportation (NEMT) company
into RTD customers’ on-demand
service solutions.
DRCOG and RTD worked with multiple
service providers in the RTD service
area to pilot a trip exchange through
December 2020. Branded as Ride
Alliance, the pilot allowed service
providers to exchange trips through a
shared software platform to help meet

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

demand. It was a proof of concept that
provided a better understanding of what
works when engaging multiple software
vendors, and developed a more concise
scope of work for the soon-to-bereleased RFP for paratransit software.
RTD FlexRide entered into an agreement with Metro Taxi at the end of 2021
to demonstrate a new service delivery
model for FlexRide service that meets
RTD’s customer demand and is more
cost-effective.
RTD is working with Boulder County to
establish a pilot cost-sharing program
to provide taxi vouchers to subsidize
service between Lyons, Longmont and
Boulder, to replace service that was
suspended due to the COVID-19
pandemic. The agreement will be
executed before the end of 2021.

Recommendation 35:
As more federal relief funds become
available, expand these partnership
opportunities to improve service
efficiency.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD supports this recommendation in
concept, because, through joint efforts,
mobility options can be enhanced
for various customer segments with
differing transit needs. This could be
achieved using sales and use revenues,
as opposed to the use of federal funds,
as direct disbursement of federal relief
funding for these purposes would be
impermissible.

044

Packet Pg. 215

02

Expansion of partnerships is limited,
given the need to ensure that
operational partnership must meet the
same terms and conditions as RTD
when providing service for its
customers. It is unknown whether
additional relief funds will be forthcoming.
As demand returns post-pandemic, RTD
will work to identify opportunities that
will raise the bar on efficiency; however,
they may not be directly linked to the
availability of additional federal funds.
As RTD looks for partnerships that
create or allow for increased efficiencies,
such enterprises would allow for control
or decrease costs. Increased federal
funds should not be required to engage
in these partnerships.

Recommendation 36:
Consider developing a competitive
Innovation Grant program to drive
bold ideas to increasing ridership.
Recipients would receive funds to dive
deeper into project concepts and
implementation, creating models of
innovation for the entire service area.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD supports an innovation grant program concept and agrees that such a
program would enhance opportunities
to partner with entities driving change
and positive disruption in the transit
space. RTD had a similar program in the
past related to small, transit-supportive
infrastructure partnerships with local
jurisdictions. RTD can explore a framework for incenting innovative projects
that increase ridership related to
first- and last-mile and local transit

045

service enhancements. Performance
metrics will need to be established to
ensure a strong relationship between
cost and ridership. For service
enhancements, there will need to be
a strong tie to the agency’s service
standards. This type of incentivebased program will require RTD to
set aside funds as part of its annual
budgeting process.

Recommendation 37:
Encourage RTD’s public-facing
dashboard to include a component
that highlights existing private and
public partnerships.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD will include information highlighting
these partnerships as it develops and
implements a public-facing dashboard.

Recommendation 38:
Regularly evaluate the success
of existing partnerships by
predetermined metrics and
“re-scope” relationships to ensure
maximum benefit.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD currently completes a thorough
evaluation before entering partnerships
and will continue to do so. As mentioned in response to Recommendation
32, RTD is in the process of developing
a new process for evaluating existing partnerships and new partnership
requests. RTD is limited in its ability to

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

Packet Pg. 216

03

modify existing contractual relationships
and will continue to evaluate and amend
existing relationships where warranted
and allowed.

Recommendation 39:
RTD should pilot First/Last mile
projects such as the First/Last Mile
RTD FreeLift Loop partnerships to
build ridership, especially among
disadvantaged communities. FreeLift
pilots would serve communities more
than a mile from rail stations and be
available only to RTD pass holders.
The service would be operated in
partnership with TNCs or nonprofits
such as Via Mobility Services and pick
up passengers at designated stops
along a designated loop route.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

RTD embraces engagement with its
partners and its commitment toward
finding innovative solutions as
evidenced by the agency’s ongoing
efforts to identify opportunities for firstand last-mile projects, especially those
serving disadvantaged communities.
In the past, RTD tried pilot projects in
partnership with local jurisdictions and
other entities with both Lyft (Centennial)
and Uber (Commuting Solutions), and is
more than willing to look at additional
pilots related to first- and last-mile
solutions in the future. RTD has been
coordinating with the city and county
of Denver on its e-scooter and e-bike
program, which requires specific
allocations of these vehicles in
disadvantaged neighborhoods.

RTD Response: Agree
RTD agrees with the Committee’s
recommendation. The agency currently
has several pilot programs to address
first- and last-mile connections and is
also in discussions with a diverse group
of entities throughout the district about
future opportunities to partner with RTD.

Fares and Pass Programs
Simplify Fares and
Pass Programs
RTD’s fare structure and pass programs
are complex and can be difficult to
navigate. Also, RTD fares are some
of the highest in the country. The
Committee recommends simplifying
fares and pass programs and making
them more affordable to improve the
customer experience and increase
ridership.

extensive outreach leveraging culturally
specific community organizations,
including those serving the Black,
Indigenous and People of Color; youth;
seniors; people with disabilities; the
unhoused; veterans; and the lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or
questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI+)
community. (See Appendix C)
Part of this endeavor is to assess RTD’s
fare structure and pass programs. RTD
will explore the recommendation to
increase the LiVE Program discount
to 50%.

Recommendation 40:

Recommendation 41:

Consolidate all discounts into a free
(or at least highly discounted) fare that
would cover equity populations (youth,
senior, disabled, and low-income).

Identify strategies to simplify
pass structures.

• Recognizing the potential barriers to
free fares, the Committee
recommends consolidating fares as
single 50% discount.
• RTD should explore increasing the
eligible age categories for free fares
up to middle school or even high 		
school aged youth.

RTD Response: Disagree
Rather than separately addressing
its discounted fare programs, RTD is
currently undertaking a first-of-its-kind
systemwide fare study and equity
analysis consistent with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and guidance
from the Federal Transit Administration.
The study and analysis will include

Implement a “family plan” benefit for all
RTD pass-holders, where an adult can
purchase fare media using one smart
card for their multiple individuals.
Standardize existing group pass
programs (EcoPass, NEcoPass, College
Pass) into one brand, EcoPass, which
is deeply discounted and focused on
incentivizing use.
• Explore a “pay as you go” pass with
fare capping/accumulators.
• Make EcoPass available to every
employee in the district (~1.5 million)
through a monthly, per employee
transportation fee assessed
on employers.
• Explore the implementation of a
recurrent “membership” model.

048

Packet Pg. 219

02

Incentivize individuals and organizations
to purchase passes in bulk by:
• Providing discounts for bulk
purchases.
• Enabling contributions to mobile
wallets from multiple entities: both 		
the employee/resident, and from
employers/governments/non-profits,
allowing employers to match
contributions directly on the pass
media of the employees.
Explore a “connect card” that allows
riders to use transit fare across various
entities (for example: CDOT’s Bustang,
and microtransit/mobility options).
Replicate pass types on the mobile
platform with fare capping/accumulators
(e.g., if you purchase fare amounts that
add up to a day/monthly pass, your fare
is automatically converted as opposed
to over paying).

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD agrees that there are opportunities
to simplify its pass programs. RTD also
agrees with the intent of these fare
program recommendations and will
consider them in connection with its
systemwide fare study and equity
analysis consistent with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and guidance
from the Federal Transit Administration.
RTD is currently studying or implementing
some of the strategies identified. RTD’s
mobile ticketing vendor is assessing
the feasibility of a mobile wallet feature
for RTD. Following this work, RTD staff
will be evaluating the cost and feasi-

049

bility of implementing this feature. Last
year, RTD was awarded an Accelerating
Innovative Mobility (AIM) grant to update
the Transit app to allow customers in a
single transaction to plan, book, and pay
for an RTD ticket and a CDOT Bustang
ticket, and to unlock and book a scooter.
The project is currently in the early
planning phase, with a target launch
date of summer/fall 2022. Finally, RTD
will be implementing a new fare
collection system that will include fare
capping starting in 2022 as described in
the recommendation.

Recommendation 42:
Convene community, business and
anchor institutions (hospitals,
universities, school districts) utilizing
passes on a regular basis to determine
updates to the agreements.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD staff currently holds meetings and
workshops with pass program clients
throughout the year and reviews pass
program contracts annually. As part of
the agency’s systemwide fare study
and equity analysis, staff will evaluate
ways to enhance engagement with pass
program clients and stakeholders. Staff
will consider increasing the consistency
and frequency of meetings to promote
collaboration with and receive feedback
from pass program customers.

Recommendation 43:
Implement equity in fare evasion
enforcement.
The fine for fare evasion on RTD
services is $75 and is set by State
statute. Given that fare evasion and
illegal parking are similar offenses, this
raises some equity concerns that transit
riders pay higher fines than car drivers.
State lawmakers and RTD should
explore legislation to address this
inequity and assure comparable fine
levels for fare evasion and parking
violations.

RTD Response: Partially Agree
RTD does not have authority to set fines
for fare evasion. Fare evasion fines are
governed by state statute, which
designates failure to present a valid
transit pass as a non-criminal traffic
infraction punishable by a $75 fine
(C.R.S. §42-4-1416). The clerk of the
court in the city and county of Denver
retains fines for violations within that
jurisdiction. The state judicial
department retains fines for violations
in any other county.

Attachment: Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee - Final Report (4558 : Response to Accountability Committee

13.F.b

House Bill 2021-1186 eliminated the
prior caps on RTD’s authority to assess
a penalty for failure to pay a parking
fee at a district parking facility. RTD will
consider the $75 fare evasion fine as it
sets future penalties for failure to pay a
parking fee.
RTD’s procedures promote uniform fare
enforcement, such that when fare is
checked on RTD vehicles, it is done so
consistently from one end of a vehicle
to the other, asking all customers to
show valid paid fare.
In addition to the forthcoming systemwide fare study and equity analysis,
RTD is assessing methods to improve
its data collection from the fare evasion
program following a recent peer
review of the agency’s transit security
model conducted by the American
Public Transportation Association
(APTA). RTD will explore opportunities
to better understand customer fare
evasion practices and to examine proof
of payment outcomes with a focus
on equity.
