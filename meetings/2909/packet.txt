Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 13
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 13 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $978,957.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula and modification to the graphics, radio
wiring and emergency exit door to the original price quotes results in a per bus unit cost of $75,555 for
a FlexRide bus and $73,926 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 13 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace
eleven - 2011/2012 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the FlexRide service and provide two
expansion buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2011 and 2012 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 8 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in
service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for

Packet Pg. 41

11.A

the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2019 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 13 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $978,966.55. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Carahsoft for licenses for the Salesforce Licenses (Customer Care Case Management/CRM) for an
amount not to exceed $2,200,000 over 4 years. Subscriptions for the Customer Care Case
Management/CRM will be paid annually.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #5 – Communication
BACKGROUND
The current TrapezeCom complaint management software is approaching end of life. RTD has selected
MTRAM (MAOIR) as a replacement for the scheduling and Runcutting needs. Since Trapeze will not be
the source of the scheduling and Runcutting data, trapeze Com will not work anymore for RTD’s case
management needs.
Starting in 2018, the Information Technology team along with Customer Care and Marketing began
researching various approaches for the districts CRM needs. Modern CRM solutions are moving toward a
cloud-based, specialized solution.
During the research phase, demonstrations of several vendor’s solutions were held with RTD business
units to determine the functionality needs and best fit for RTD business processes. Through this series
of demos and requirements gathering sessions, the determination has been made that for the Customer
Case Management/CRM will utilize Salesforce. Some examples of the Customer Case Management/CRM
modules include:
1

3

Service Management/ Case Management
Digital Marketing Management
Social Engagement Management

The Board previously approved a total of $5,000,000 for the Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management program in the 2018 - 2023 Strategic Budget Plan. The contract authority recommended
in this board action will use a portion of this approved funding for this set of subscription licenses.
DISSCUSSION
RTD conducted an RFI to obtain pricing for these modules with the National Association of State
Budget Officers (NASBO). NASBO have pre-negotiated contracts with the State of Colorado. The State

bid and awarded these contracts through their standard procurement processes and these contracts
allow other governmental agencies to utilize them.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,200,000. Funding for these licenses is included in the
approved CRM Program budget.
The yearly breakdown for the licenses is as follows:
2019
2020
2021
2022

$250,000
$625,000
$650,000

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to Carahsoft for licenses for the Salesforce Licenses (Customer Care Case
Management/CRM) for an amount not to exceed $2,200,000 over 4 years. Subscriptions for
the Customer Care Case Management/CRM will be paid annually.
2. Remain on our existing Trapeze Com implementation which will become unusable after 2020.

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the
amount of the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installations contract with Manion Construction,
Inc. by $1,000,000.00, and extend the contract until December 31, 2020. Funding for this contract
amendment is provided by various RTD budget line items.
This action addresses Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services of the General Manager’s
goals for 2019.
BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised contract and was
awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in April of 2017.
The contract allowed for two, one year options. To date, the following changes have been authorized:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
$ 200,000.00
$ 1,061,282.25
Second option year (2019) $ 405,250.73
$ 210,000.00
$ 1,676,532.98
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and both option years (2018 & 2019) =$1,676,532.98
The current contract is scheduled to expire in April 2020. We exercised the second option year earlier in
2019 based on the information we had at the time about the work that needed to be done. The reason
for seeking this increase above and beyond the original contract scope is that we have a backlog of
work that needs to be completed, and we need the ability to be able to support bus stop alterations.
We did more work than was originally anticipated. We also used this contract to do work at the 72nd
and Brighton park-n-Ride, to support the North Metro stand up. We intend to use this contract to do
some work to support the close-out of I-225 and North Metro, in addition to the Street Improvement and
Shelter Installation work.

Packet Pg. 45

11.C

Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very good
contractor. He provides quality work in a cost effective and timely manner.
DISCUSSION
This will increase the contract by $1,000,000.00, creating a total contract amount of $2,676,532.98
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $1,000,000.00 funding for this Board Action will come from various budget line items, both from
base and FasTracks, using local funding only.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to increase the amount of the annual Street Improvements &
Shelter Installations contract with Manion Construction, Inc. by $1,000,000.00, and extend the
contract until December 31, 2020. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by various
RTD budget line items.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to increase the amount of the contract by 1.000,000.00,
and do not extend the date until December 31, 2020 for the annual Street Improvements &
Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for
Bid (IFB). This is not recommended because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned work that needs to be done.
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2019 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Subject:

Purchase Forty-six (46) 40 foot Low Floor
Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of forty six (46) new 40 foot
transit buses from Gillig, LLC and associated spare components, and extended warranties for a total
price not to exceed $22,527,120 with an option to purchase up to 264 additional 40 foot buses over a
five year period.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 5000 series Gillig 40 foot transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years
or 500,000 miles. The buses are 14 years old and have on average over 600,000 miles of stop and go
transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 20, 2019 for the procurement of new 40 foot transit
buses. Proposals were received on August 13, 2019.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from three companies: Gillig, New Flyer and Nova. The proposers submitted
their cost per bus as follows:
Nova Bus
New Flyer
Gillig
$458,924.00 $479,900.00 $462,252.00
The proposals were rated according to costs as well as independent evaluation by members of RTD Bus
Maintenance staff on the ability of the proposers to comply with RTD’s technical specification
requirements, their estimated lifecycle costs and their qualifications. Although Gillig was not the lowest
cost per bus, staff members unanimously rated Gillig the highest in meeting RTD’s technical
specification requirements, lifecycle costs and qualifications, and subsequently Gillig received the highest
overall rating. Gillig has proven experience and qualification in manufacturing of transit buses, being one
of the oldest and most financially stable manufacturers in North America. Gillig also has a history of
meeting delivery schedule requirements.
The 40 foot low floor buses are similar to that which is currently utilized at RTD, with a proven seating
layout that is approved by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) to maximize wheelchair

Packet Pg. 47

12.D

passenger space. The buses are equipped with clean diesel engines meeting the latest EPA requirements.
Overall, the estimated lifetime of each bus will reduce emissions by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases,
6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides (NOx) and 0.25 tons of Particulate Matter as compared to the engines in the
current 2005 buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract is for the purchase of forty six (46) 40 foot transit buses, associated spare
components, and selected extended warranties not to exceed $22,527,120. Funding for this contract is
approved and available in the District’s 2019 Adopted Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 264 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly. Additional future bus purchases from these options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to enter into the agreement with Gillig, LLC for the purchase of
forty six (46) 40’ transit buses and various spare components and extended warranties. This is
the recommended alternative.
2. Purchase buses from another manufacturer. This may result in a slightly lower initial capital
purchase price but will result in additional operational costs for spare parts, add complexity to the
fleet thereby reducing efficiency, as well as delay delivery of the buses. This is not
recommended.
3. Do not proceed with the purchase of new 40’ transit buses. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the
project. This will also increase ongoing maintenance costs and affect fleet reliability.

Approval of the 29th & Welton Property

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors extend by two 90-day terms (for a total of six months) the option for the sale of the real
property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”), including
execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
This action addresses one of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the policy goals of Resolution 17 in 2010, the TOD Strategic Plan by supporting
creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD originally acquired the property at 29th and Welton in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for
local businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central Corridor LRT. The property is
currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s
parking management system.
In 2010, the RTD Board adopted the TOD Strategic Plan to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementing the new TOD Strategic Plan. Pursuant to that
policy direction, RTD selected the Welton corridor as a Pilot Program site because of a combination of
favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s (the “City’s”)
commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy (the “Vision Plan”), which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor including
activation of RTD’s 29th and Welton property. The plan emphasizes the need to retain housing
affordability in the Welton corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED), now Denver
Economic Development & Opportunity (DEDO) began discussions around how to partner to implement
the community vision established in the Five Points Business District Vision Plan as part of the RTD TOD
Pilot Program implementation.

Packet Pg. 49

12.E

Following RTD Board authorization of the option for sale in December 2016, RTD and the City executed
the option agreement in September of 2017. In order to exercise the option and complete the purchase,
the following conditions precedent must be met:
i) successful procurement of a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium project
according to the terms agreed upon by RTD and the City;
ii) the selected developer reaching an agreement on business terms with the City; and
iii) the selected developer securing the financing necessary to complete the project.
The City also has the right to assign the option to the selected developer, meaning the selected
developer could purchase the property directly from RTD on the same terms as the City and subject to
the same conditions. The term of the option is two years from the date of its execution, with the ability
to grant two ninety-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction. The final purchase price for
the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of the Property. The option agreement is set
to expire on September 25, 2019.
To date, RTD and the City have completed a competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixedincome condominium project on the Property. OED led the RFQ process, and RTD participated in the
selection panel. However, the selected developer has not secured the financing necessary to complete
the project. If granted a six-month extension, the selected developer will reconfigure the proposed
development to focus on housing over commercial space, thus enabling them to secure financing and
come to an agreement on business terms with the City.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to extend the City’s
option to purchase the Property through two ninety-day extensions, or six months.
If the City fails to exercise the option during the extended option period, RTD would remain the
property owner and any subsequent decisions about the Property would require Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,000 per year maintaining the proper ty. If the property is
sold, RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation. If the Option is exercised, RTD will
receive the amount determined by a fair market value appraisal of the Property. Per Board policy,
proceeds of the sale would be contributed to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors extend by two 90-day terms (for a total of six months) the option for the sale of the
real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”),
including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the Option to Purchase the Real
Property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver CO. This is not recommended because
RTD does not have any current or future transit need for the property, and because this would
be inconsistent with the goals of the TOD pilot program previously approved by the Board in
December of 2010.

Subject:

Summary of Proposed Option terms for 29th and Welton TOD Pilot Project

Planningfjtjkl(/~

The following memo summarizes the issues addressed in the December 6, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee, and provides a point by point summary of the items outlined in the Board
Report regarding the terms of the proposed option.

Staff recommends this approach as striking a

balance between multiple policy goals, and as a means to continue the partnership and working
relationship with the City of Denver established in 2010. This approach also seeks to balance limiting
the number of constraints placed on an actual transaction to allow the District to maximize revenue and
simplify negotiations, while still protecting the District by insuring the land is not sold if the developer
procurement process and negotiations (both led by City of Denver) are unsuccessful.
Governing Policies:
•

2016 District Goal of Fiscal Sustainability

•

2010 Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution Only Attached) and 2010 Pilot Program

Goals & Objectives:
•

Leverage RTD assets through sale of non-transit property at appraised Fair Market Value.

•

Encourage creation of mixed income communities near tran sit through partnership with
Denver's Office of Economic Development. RTD's partnership w ith the City of Denver (both
Community Planning and Development and Office of Economic Development) to bring forward a
project meeting City and RTD goals extends back to 2010, over 6 years.

•

Promote cooperation with other stakeholders, and leverage public/ public partnerships to meet
strategic goa ls.

12.E.b

Proposed Transaction Structure:
•

Denver's Office of Economic Development ("OED" ) leads RFQ process for development partner
for a mixed-income condominium project. RTD participates in the RFQ selection process.
o

OED is prepared to commit substantial funding to cover the gap between units priced
for households making 80%-100% of Area Median Income.
•

A buyer making 80% of AMI can afford a 1 bedroom unit priced at $170,000.

•

1 bedroom market-rate units in downtown Denver are priced starting in the low
$300,000's.

o

OED has committed that the RFQ will require that a minimum of 25% of units be
income-restricted to buyers at 80-100% of AMI, and that preference will be given to
respondents who propose developing a project with a higher proportion of affordable
units.

•

RTD grants an option to buy the property to OED. OED may only purchase the property if it
meets certain conditions (see Option Terms below).

•

If those conditions are met, OED may choose to either buy the property directly or assign the
option to buy to the selected developer on the same terms. Allowing assignment of the option
to the selected developer will allow OED, if they choose, to bring forward all the proposed terms
to Denver City Council as a single package for Council approval.

•

If the OED does not exercise the option, RTD will keep the property. The reasons why OED
would not be able to exercise the option are if:
•

RFQ is unsuccessful (ie-no qualified responses); or

•

OED is unable to reach agreement with the selected developer on the amount
of subsidy OED will provide; or

•

the selected developer cannot secure lender financing to build the proposed
project.

•

RTD's grant of an option to OED simplifies the process because the selected developer
negotiates all business terms directly with OED.

•

RTD's grant of an option creates certainty for respondents to the RFQ that the property will be
available at previously agreed on terms.

•

Simplification and certainty of process are more likely to result in a successful RFQ solicitation.

Some of the key option terms:
Length of Option:
•

2 years from execution.

Two 90 day extensions (at RTD' s discretion) if needed to

complete the transaction. For example, if all terms have been negotiated, and the
developer is awaiting finalizing documents with a lender, an extension could be granted

Packet Pg. 54

Attachment: 29th Welton Memo to Board w-Summary of Proposed Option terms 29th Welton TOD Pilot Project (3937 : Approval of the 29th &

12.E.b

to allow that to occur. If the option conditions are not met within the 2 year timeframe,
OED could seek an extension from the RTD Board of Directors who would have to
approve the extension .
Option Price:
•

Fair Market Value based on appraisal. Per standard RTD policy, if the option is not
exercised within 6 months of the appraisal date, the appraisal must be updated.

Conditions for exercising or assigning the Option :
•

Successful procurement of a developer who commits to build a mixed-income
condominium project with a minimum of 25% units at 80-100% AMI.

•

OED and the selected developer reach an agreement on business terms for the amount
of subsidy required to build the project.

•

The selected developer secures the financing necessary to complete the project.

•

OED may assign the option only to the selected developer, and only if all of these
conditions are met; or

•

OED may exercise the option directly only if all of these conditions are met.

Process for exercising the Option:
•

OED or selected developer provides written notice that the conditions have been met,
and delivers the purchase price (appraised value} to RTD .

•

RTD delivers the deed to the property to OED or the selected developer.

Board of Directors

Denver, CO 80202
To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve an option agreement between RTD and the city to acquire the
RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton Street for the development of mixed-income
housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) has been working
closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented Development team to plan for the development of
mixed-income for-sale housing on this site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on
this joint effort to provide critical affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Points
neighborhood.
OED’s mission is to advance economic prosperity for the city and its businesses, neighborhoods
and residents. As part of this mission, OED invests federal and local funds in the development
and preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, OED
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, OED invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Doug Tisdale, Director, District H

Date:

September 18, 2019

Subject:

Approval of National Medal of Honor Museum
Sub-lease

Date: September 19, 2019

Board Meeting Date: September 24, 2019

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Chair Tisdale, Director Broom, Director Catlin, Director Guissinger, Director
Walker and Director Whitmore that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or
his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for a sub-lease of the vacant portion
of the real property located adjacent to Civic Center Station on Colfax Avenue between Lincoln and
Broadway, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”), contingent on the National Medal of Honor Museum
(“NMOHM”) selecting Denver for its new museum. This would increase RTD revenues by
approximately $123,000 annually.
This action addresses one of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
As the reconstruction of Civic Center Station was planned, it was determined that a portion of the land
used for the original station was no longer needed under the new design. At the request of City and
County of Denver (the “City”) and local partners, this portion of land on the south side of the lot was set
aside for future development. Potential uses for the site discussed to date have included art installations,
food trucks, hotel developments, and a consolidated RTD headquarters, among others. Due to
complications on the site and the fact that RTD holds it through a ground lease that will expire in 2075,
development has not occurred.
Meanwhile, the NMOHM has conducted a nationwide search for a site to construct its museum. The
NMOHM Board has narrowed down their selection to two cities: Denver, Colorado, and Arlington, Texas.
The Denver site is State of Colorado property that is currently a surface parking lot at the corner of
Lincoln and Colfax. The NMOHM has indicated that a grand, park-like entrance to the museum on the
RTD-leased property across Lincoln is essential to Denver’s proposal. The NMOHM initially offered to
pay $1 per year to RTD to sub-lease the Property. A portion of the RTD Board indicated a preference
that the NMOHM cover RTD’s ground lease costs for the Property. However, as the NMOHM has not
agreed to cover RTD’s ground lease costs for the parcel, the City has stepped in to sub-lease the
Property and cover the cost itself, subject to City Council approval.

Packet Pg. 60

13.F

DISCUSSION
Approving the recommended action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the
authority to sub-lease the Property to the City for the remainder of the ground lease term, which
expires in 2075. The rent for the Property would equal a pro rata share of the larger parcel’s ground
lease cost, which escalates by 1% annually. The City or their designee would be responsible for
maintenance and security on the Property. Changes to the parcel would need to be approved by
RTD, could not negatively affect RTD operations and would need to accommodate RTD transit
needs, including pedestrian access, lighting, safety, and security.
If the NMOHM does not select Denver, the sub-lease would not be executed and any subsequent
decisions about the Property would require Board approval. If the NMOHM fails to meet certain
fundraising, construction, opening, and/or operating milestones, which will be set forth in the sub lease, the sub-lease will terminate.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The portion of the land that would be subleased to NMOHM represents approximately 45% of the
square footage of the parcel. In 2020, RTD would expect to receive approximately $123,000 in rent
as a pro rata share of the ground lease for the larger parcel, and this amount would increase by 1%
each year per the terms of the ground lease.
If the property is sub-leased, RTD will no longer have a maintenance obligation and the ground lease
costs will be covered by the City until the expiration of the ground lease in 2075.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Chair Tisdale, Director Broom, Director Catlin, Director Guissinger,
Director Walker, and Director Whitmore that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General
Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for a sub lease of the vacant portion of the real property located adjacent to Civic Center Station on
Colfax Avenue between Lincoln and Broadway, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”), contingent
on the National Medal of Honor Museum (“NMOHM”) selecting Denver for its new museum.
This would increase RTD revenues by approximately $123,000 annually, or
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his
designee to sub-lease the vacant portion of the real property located adjacent to Civic Center.
This is not recommended because RTD does not have any current or future transit need for
the Property.

To the RTD Board of Directors:
The City and County of Denver and the State of Colorado have the unique opportunity to attract a national
institution that honors our country’s heroes and ensures that the stories and legacy of those who have
distinguished themselves at the highest level endure. The prospect of attracting this project to Denver has
galvanized civic, philanthropic, business and political leaders and other stakeholders from across the state. This
letter is to express Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the project and for the proposal before you to
authorize RTD to engage in sublease negotiations with the city for the unused, vacant portion of the real estate
property located adjacent to Civic Center Station. The RTD south lot is a critical component to the National Medal
of Honor Museum proposal, and your support will allow for Denver to continue to be considered for their new
location.
Not only would the proposed National Medal of Honor Museum be a place that honors and recognizes our 3,524
national Medal of Honor recipients, it would also celebrate the countless selfless acts of valor, courage, patriotism,
integrity and humility that we collectively are so fortunate to experience and benefit from every day, thanks to our
servicemen and women, first responders and emergency personnel, public servants, and our residents.
The Museum will be a place of learning that will inspire us and future generations to find the hero within ourselves
and empower the next generation of leaders. Bringing the Medal of Honor Museum to Denver is an opportunity to
add a place of reverence and honor to our community that informs us, inspires us and makes Colorado a true
home to heroes.
The Museum’s leadership has a bold vision for this project, in terms of its mission, partnerships with the
community selected and the facility’s design and layout. The project elements include not only the building site,
but an open space that will include commemorative art and elements preparing the visitors for the experience that
will also serve as a public space for reflection and tranquility.
The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and the Museum to attract the project to the proposed site.
Thank you. We appreciate your partnership.

Respectfully,

Michael B. Hancock

Dear RTD Board of Directors,
Thank you for your thoughtful review of the City’s proposal to sub lease a portion of the RTD
south lot located on the corner of Colfax and Lincoln. We strongly believe that bringing the
Medal of Honor Museum to Denver is an opportunity to add a place of reverence and honor to
our community that informs us, inspires us, and makes Colorado a true home to heroes.
Attached is additional information about the Museum and proposed use of the lot, that we
hope adds clarity to the discussion and provide a sense of the importance of the National
Medal Museum of Honor project to not only Denver, but the entire state and Mountain West.
We are also including all the letters of support that were received from community partners
from across the state.
I will attend both the Executive Committee this Thursday, and the Board meeting on September
24 and would be happy to answer any questions you may have at that time.
Thank you again, we value your partnership, and look forward to working together.

NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR MUSEUM PROJECT INFO SHEET
SEPTEMBER 2019
THE VISION
Creating a National Treasure that honors and recognizes our national medal of honor
recipients.
•
•
•
•

The Medal of Honor is our nation’s highest and most prestigious military decoration.
Presented to roughly 3,500 recipients since its founding during the Civil War, the medal
symbolizes the timeless American ideals of courage, patriotism, integrity and humility.
The Museum will commemorate the stories of the Medal of Honor recipients, unite
Americans around what it means to be patriotic, and inspire us to find the hero within
ourselves.
Bringing the Medal of Honor Museum to Denver is an opportunity to add a place of
reverence and honor to our community that informs us, inspires us and makes Colorado
a true home to heroes.
The proposed Museum site is located across the street from the RTD south lot, located
at the corner of Lincoln and Colfax Ave. The RTD south lot would be developed as open
space, available for use by the public including RTD riders, that complements the
Museum and surrounding area, and creates a welcoming gateway to the Museum.

THE IMPACT
Attraction of a major cultural asset to downtown Denver and the state of Colorado
•

A conservative estimate of the local fiscal impact to Denver based on 500,000 annual
visitors and incorporating a breakdown into local and non-local/out-of-state visitors,
arrives at $2M incremental sales tax revenue annually to the City and County of
Denver. We also anticipate even greater impact to State of Colorado through the influx
of net-new visitors to our State.

Bringing the Medal of Honor Museum to Denver is an opportunity to add a place of
reverence and honor to our community that informs us, inspires us and makes Colorado
a true home to heroes.

VALUE PROPOSITION TO RTD
Providing significant financial benefit to RTD
• The proposed sub lease would cover approximately one third, or 20,000 SF of the south
lot. Please note, the City would not be leasing the entire 60,000 SF that RTD currently
has a 55-year lease on. Annual lease payments to RTD are equal to RTD’s rental
payments due under the Ground Lease, estimated at $123,000 per annum, escalating by
1% per annum. This would be a significant financial benefit to RTD and addresses the
prior objection RTD had by defraying the costs that RTD would incur in connection to
the parcel. RTD would also have the remaining two-thirds of the lot for future
development.
• We have estimated based on economic models of similar Museum’s financial impact on
net new out of state visitors that this Museum will bring between $600,000 and
$3,000,000 per year in new sales tax revenue to the Regional Transportation District.
This does not include new in revenue from in-state out of District visitors or new fare
box revenue generated by visitors to the Museum.
• Our ability to attract the Museum’s interest, is in part, based on all the investments our
region has made in infrastructure and transportation and this will reinforce ridership
and revenue to help keep our infrastructure viable.
• $150 million estimated in capital construction spending driving temporary construction
and services jobs.
• 150 direct permanent jobs employed my Museum in early operating years expected to
ramp up to 300 permanent jobs.
• The improvements to the south lot, would provide a unique public space that further
activates what is now a gravel lot while enhancing Denver's Upper Downtown area.
• Construction of a one-of-a kind $100M cultural facility adjacent to Civic Center Park and
the RTD Civic Center Station will drive more visitors to the area.
• The project greatly complements Denver’s National Landmarks, the Civic Center Park
and adds green space to the urban core.
• The Museum and the improved RTD south lot will complement Colorado’s existing
military assets and installations and enhances our aerospace and defense sectors.
• The RTD south lot will function as open space complementary to the Museum. If
awarded the site location, a national design competition would be held which would
include the RTD south lot. Project design, maintenance, and security would adhere to
RTD and City standards, ordinances, and requirements. The Museum would fund
improvements, maintenance, and security of premises – again no cost to RTD.

The Medal of Honor Museum project has strong support from the Governor, Mayor,
philanthropic community, education and business leaders, Metro Mayors Caucus,
military and veteran’s community. This support has been on display at public events
related to the Museum and in more than 50 letters for support from organizations
across the state. (These are included in this packet here and were provided to the
Museum site selection team)

Colorado has more than 400,000 active military service member veterans. Home to the
legendary 10th Mountain Division in Leadville, United States Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, as well as the former Lowry Air Force Base and the very first VFW

military community today.

ADDITIONAL PROJECT BACKGROUND
•
•
•
•
•

•

Denver is one of two finalists, along with Arlington, Texas under consideration by the
Medal of Honor Museum.
The Board of Directors for the National Medal of Honor Museum are expected to make
the final location decision in early October.
Should Denver be selected, final discussions and negotiations with the RTD Board will
commence in Q1 2020. The sublease is also subject to approval from Denver City
Council.
The site under consideration for the Museum is located at the corner of E Colfax and
Lincoln and is owned by the State of Colorado.
The proposed Denver location near Civic Center Park represents a uniquely connected
site within a thriving contemporary American city. Our geographic location is accessible
to visitors from around the country and the site is located near other cultural and
historical venues.
The CEO of the National Medal of Honor Foundation is Joe Daniels. He was appointed
to the role in April 2018. For 11 years, Daniels directed planning, construction, and the
development and operations for the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York
City. Drawing on the strong connection between 9/11 and the U.S. military, Daniels
created a spectrum of events and special programs for thousands of veterans and
members of the military, including Medal of Honor recipients. Additionally, Daniels
worked diligently to ensure that military families were included in these initiatives,
understanding they also made profound sacrifices for our country.

Thank you very much for visiting Colorado a few weeks ago to learn about what Colorado has
to offer as a home for the National Medal of Honor Museum. Our state is home to one of the
most dynamic economies in the country. Tourists and new residents alike flock to our state to
take advantage of its natural beauty, beautiful weather, and recreational opportunities. The
City of Denver hosts world-class sports teams, one of the largest performing arts complexes in
the country, a newly-expanded convention center, exceptional parks, museums, restaurants,
and a diverse community of welcoming people. Whether coming to our state for an extended
vacation or just for a few days, there is always something interesting to do.
The State of Colorado and the City of Denver are prospering, and we would like to present
you with a unique opportunity to join in that prosperity and partner with us to create a home
for the new National Medal of Honor Museum, where Americans can honor and learn the
history of its bravest and finest. We really want you to come to Colorado.
The state currently owns a half-acre parcel of land nestled in one of the liveliest
neighborhoods in Denver where commerce, government, and tourism intersect.
The location is flanked by the beautiful architecture of the State Capitol, the Denver City and
County building, and Civic Center Park on one end, and the ever-growing skyline of downtown
Denver on the other. Located at the center of our downtown, the parcel sits across from the
new Civic Center bus terminal, providing easy access to Union Station, the larger metro area,
and Denver International Airport.
Colorado shares a proud military history and is home to several active duty military
installations and a vibrant veteran community. Many Medal of Honor recipients have called
our great state home. In 1993, Congress proclaimed the City of Pueblo to be “America’s Home
of Heroes” for the city’s distinction of calling four living recipients of the Medal of Honor
residents. And earlier this month, the city dedicated the Medal of Honor Plaza and along with
four statues of these heroes.
We are excited for the opportunity to partner with you on this project, which achieves your
vision for a new national museum, and our vision to complete Civic Center Park with a worldclass amenity. To accommodate the building of the Medal of Honor Museum, new legislation is
required but as a state-owned property, Denver’s permitting rules will serve only as guidance.
On behalf of the Governor’s Office and the Colorado General Assembly, we stand ready to
make this a top priority and quickly move a bill through this process.
We are committed to being nimble and flexible in working through the real estate related
questions in a very quick manner and providing you the support you need.

Joe Daniels, CEO
National Medal of Honor Museum
Dear Mr. Daniels:
It is my pleasure to express my enthusiastic support of the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation’s
consideration of Denver as the site for the new National Medal of Honor Museum. Colorado is home to
legendary 10th Mountain Division in Leadville, the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, as
well as the former Lowry Air Force Base in Denver. Denver is rich in military history and enjoys an active
military community today. We are committed to fostering a long-term partnership to ensure the success of
the Museum and its ability to fulfill the mission and vision, and we are at the ready to provide the
information necessary for you to make this important decision.
Denver is a welcoming city, in a state where “Mile High” hospitality isn’t just an expression. Colorado
welcomed over 85 million visitors in 2018, a number that has grown year after year. Our robust tourism
industry would help to ensure that the National Medal of Honor Museum would be well attended and
receive the attention it so richly deserves. The central location of the National Medal of Honor Museum will
also offer a unique setting in downtown Denver, interwoven with the city and located close to Civic Center
Park, the History Colorado museum, the Denver Art Museum and the Vance Kirkland Museum – a perfect fit
in our cultural landscape. It will also be near the State Capitol and the 16th Street pedestrian mall, two of the
top tourist attractions in the city.
We in Denver are proud of our history and our proven strategy of working in partnerships, listening to our
community, and investing in our infrastructure and neighborhoods to continue to propel the city forward. We
believe the National Medal of Honor Museum will be a place for learning that engages, unites and reinforces
our patriotic bonds, preserves these stories, and embraces the promise of the future.
We look forward to welcoming you to the Mile High City, where you can further envision locating the
National Medal of Honor Museum in Denver as a truly integral part of the civic, cultural and commercial life,
both for residents and visitors.
Respectfully,

Michael B. Hancock
Mayor

To Whom it May Concern:
It is my honor to support Denver as site of the new National Medal of Honor Museum. Denver
International Airport (DEN) can attest to our city’s suitability for this honored institution. Allow me to
mention a few benefits the airport adds to the long list of reasons you should select the Mile High City.
To begin with, DEN is America’s best large airport, according to the Wall Street Journal last year. We
have set new passenger traffic records each month for nearly three years straight, and we expect to
shatter last year’s record of 64.5 million passengers. On average, 181,000 passengers use DEN each
day. More and more people are choosing to Visit Denver and Colorado.
To accommodate such growth, we are expanding our concourses by adding 39 new gates and a wide
variety of concessions; and we’re optimizing our terminal for an improved passenger experience and
streamlined security. And DEN boasts the third-best airport staff in North America (Skytrax World
Airport Awards) so museum visitors arriving through the airport will be treated to a world-class
welcome.
Our central-continental location creates an international crossroads that will place the museum in an
attractive spotlight for the more than 85 million visitors to Colorado each year. DEN brings visitors
from 215 nonstop domestic destinations on 23 airline partners. Our expanding list of international
destinations includes Frankfurt, London Munich, Paris Tokyo and Zurich among others.
A commuter-rail line connects DEN with downtown Denver so museum guests can easily connect to
the airport on trains that depart every 15 minutes during museum hours.
The museum’s board couldn’t choose a better place for the museum than Denver, and the move to
Denver couldn’t happen at a better time.
Sincerely,

Kim Day

Dear Mr. Daniels and the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation Board of Directors:
We am writing to you on behalf of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce to share our support to
locate the National Medal of Honor Museum here in Denver.
Our Chamber represents 3,000 businesses and more than 300,000 employees who can share with you
what you’ve likely already experienced as you’ve gotten to know our region: We are a place that is
welcoming, that has a proud military history and that is hungry to enjoy cultural experiences – and will
attract tourists to do the same.
•

We pride ourselves on our welcoming reputation. Maybe it’s because many of us visited this
great state before we called it home, but this is a region on the rise that has proudly kept the
inviting nature of a smaller community. The museum and its visitors would have a warm
welcome from the entire state.
Our proud military history spans the 10th Mountain Division in Leadville to the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs. The National Medal of Honor Museum would be located near
Civic Center Park in downtown Denver, providing a military “trail” that would span the state.
Our residents – and tourists – love to take in cultural experiences. The National Medal of
Honor Museum would join a community that enjoys opportunities to learn and engage. Last
year 15 million people attended our arts and cultural facilities, and in total we welcomed 85.2
million visitors, a number that has grown year over year. Our local appreciation and our robust
tourism industry would help to ensure that the National Medal of Honor Museum would be
well-attended and receive the attention it so richly deserves.

It would truly be an honor to host the National Medal of Honor Museum here and honor our country’s
greatest heroes. Thank you for considering Colorado. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any

Dear Mr. Daniels,
VISIT DENVER, The Convention and Visitors Bureau, is pleased to submit this letter in enthusiastic and full support
for the National Medal of Honor Museum to choose Denver as its future location. VISIT DENVER’s mission is to
bring convention and leisure visitors to Denver for the economic benefit of the City, the community and our
partners. In 2018, Denver welcomed more than 31 million visitors, including 17.3 million overnight visitors who
spent $5.6 billion in the local economy. Since 2006, Denver has experienced a 64% increase in tourism, compared
to 22% nationwide. This dramatic increase is due to several destination factors including accessibility, quality of
facilities such as hotels and venues, strong safety record, superior customer service and friendly residents,
affordability to travel to and within Denver, and our sustainability efforts.
We believe the National Medal of Honor Museum will be a prominent new attraction in Denver for local residents
as well as visitors. For visitors, Denver International Airport (DEN) is the 5th busiest airport in the U.S. and 20th in
the world, offering more than 1,800 daily flights to 188 domestic and 26 international locations. Our hotel partners
offer nearly 11,000 rooms downtown (with nearly 3,000 in development) and approximately 54,000 rooms
available throughout the Denver metro area.
Recent third-party recognition for Denver includes being the 2nd most walkable metropolis in the U.S. (Smart
Growth America), #2 best place to live (U.S. News & World Report), #1 large airport in the U.S. (Wall Street
Journal), and one of the Best Cities for an Active Lifestyle (WalletHub), among many others. Recently, VISIT
DENVER and the City of Denver achieved Level One certification with the ASTM/APEX Standard for Destinations for
Environmentally Sustainable Meetings, Events, Trade Shows, and Conferences. VISIT DENVER was the first
convention and visitors bureau (CVB) in the world to achieve this certification.
VISIT DENVER is committed to utilizing our full suite of integrated marketing programs to promote the National
Medal of Honor Museum in Denver to local, regional, national and international audiences. These programs
include our seasonal campaigns that target specific U.S. cities as well as our national campaign. In addition,
regional visitors will be a focus through our dedicated weekend marketing campaign. And, we will partner with the
Colorado Tourism Office (CTO) to promote the museum to international visitors, a growing segment of Denver’s
visitors.
It would be a true honor to have the National Medal of Honor museum choose Denver as its future location. Please
do not hesitate to contact me for any additional information or with questions at rscharf@visitdenver.com or 303571-9415.

Opening the future for business in Jefferson county, Colorado

RE: Support for the Medal of Honor Museum
Dear Joe Daniels and the Medal of Honor Museum Board of Directors:
Please accept this letter of support on behalf of Jefferson County Economic Development
(Jeffco EDC) in selecting Denver for the National Medal of Honor Museum.
Colorado is one of the premier places to live, explore, work, and conduct business. It is a state
where the best and the brightest from around the world come to work hard and play hard. In
short, Colorado is a collaborative state. Businesses cite the synergies and value of Coloradans
working together. We understand that a rising tide raises all boats, and that working together
makes life in Colorado better for everyone. Thus, Denver is the ideal location for the National
Medal of Honor Museum.
Colorado has a long military history, from the 10th Mountain Division in Leadville to the Air
Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The Medal of Honor Museum would be located near Civic
Center Park in downtown Denver, providing a military “trail” that would span the state.
As the economic development agency for Jefferson County, we see this as an opportunity for
our greater Colorado community to expand its diverse cultural landscape, attract visitors, and
showcase the robust tourism industry. As such, we fully support this proposal to locate the
National Medal of Honor Museum in Denver.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss further.
Thank you for your full consideration of this very important decision.

Sincerely,

Kristi Pollard

Joe Daniels and the Medal of Honor Museum Board of Directors
Dear Mr. Daniels and Distinguished Members of the Medal of Honor Museum Board of Directors,
It is my pleasure, and indeed an honor, to write to you in support of placing the Medal of Honor Museum in
Denver. Here are several reasons for this support:
•

The military history of Colorado is extensive, from the 10th Mountain Division in Leadville to the Air
Force Academy in Colorado Springs. By building the Medal of Honor Museum near Civic Center Park
in downtown Denver, a military “trail” would be established that would span the state.

•

Metro Denver has 300 sunny days a year — more annual days of sunshine than either San Diego or
Miami Beach. When one adds in the low humidity, the climate is such that people will welcome the
opportunity travel and visit the museum.

•

Colorado is a welcoming state, where Mile High Hospitality isn’t just an expression. Our tourism office
offers complimentary Colorado Concierge training to all frontline employees, ensuring a welcoming
environment for everyone. The museum and its visitors would have a warm and sincere welcome from
the entire state.

•

The central location of the Medal of Honor Museum offers a unique setting that maximizes visitor
attendance. Located near Civic Center Park and adjacent to the Colorado History Museum, Denver Art
Museum and the Vance Kirkland Museum, the Medal of Honor Museum would be a perfect fit to our
cultural landscape.

Colorado welcomed 85.2 million visitors in 2018, a number that has grown year over year. The robust
tourism industry would help to ensure that the Medal of Honor Museum would be well attended and receive
the attention it so richly deserves.
The prospect of having Denver as the selected site of the Medal of Honor Museum, is an exciting one.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may provide any further clarifications or information to make this
placement of the Medal of Honor Museum in Denver, a reality.
Very sincerely,

Laurence Kaptain

Dear Joe Daniels & the National Medal of Honor Museum Board of Directors,
This letter is to show support for Denver being the new and permanent home of the
National Medal of Honor Museum. The American GI Forum has a long history of
advocating for our military veterans and their families. The American GI Forum of the
US was founded in 1948 by Dr. Hector P. Garcia who was a military veteran himself
and saw the need to help his fellow veterans get the proper benefits and treatment
they deserved. The American GI Forum of Colorado has been performing those same
values since 1952.
Denver has the beauty of the Rocky Mountains that will be seen from the new
museum site and they stretch across the horizon. It will be centrally located for the
whole nation to visit, easily accessible and it has a great economy that is prospering.
Denver has the ability to accommodate visitors with a small town feeling, yet having all
of the advantages of what major city has to offer.
The American GI Forum of Colorado will be proud to have the National Medal of Honor
Museum in the capital city of our home state. We will be there every step of the way
and extend our arms in welcome of the new museum and all who visit it.
With our warmest regards,

Russell J Lopez

Dear Mr. Daniels
The Estes Park Economic Development Corporation (Estes Park EDC) enthusiastically endorses Denver
Colorado as the finalist for the National Medal of Honor Museum.

Colorado has a long military history, from the 10th Mountain Division in Leadville to the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs. The Medal of Honor Museum would be located near Civic Center
Park in downtown Denver, providing a military “trail” that would span the state.
Colorado is a welcoming state, where Mile High Hospitality isn’t just an expression. Our
tourism office offers complimentary Colorado Concierge training to all frontline
employees, ensuring a welcoming environment for everyone. The museum and its

Colorado is a collaborative state. Businesses cite the synergies and value of
Coloradoans working together. We understand that a rising tide raises all boats, and that
working together makes life in Colorado better for everyone.
Colorado welcomed 85.2 million visitors in 2018, a number that has grown year over
year. Our robust tourism industry would help to ensure that the National Medal of Honor Museum
would be well attended and receive the attention it so richly deserves.
As well, Northern Colorado is a place of sanctuary where many of our countries veterans have
found themselves while searching for healing in nature. Our community of Estes Park, just 90
minutes from Denver, recognizes the contributions of veterans and regularly honors them through
community events. In 2018 we held an “Intimate Dinner for WWII Veterans” and our youngest
WWII Veteran Attendee was 96 years old. This year, the community is planning an Honorary
Evening for Korean War Veterans. As an Economic Development Professional as well as the
founder of a Veteran and First Responder nonprofit, I’m very familiar with the role our veterans
play in the diversity and sustainability of our Colorado communities.

Thank you for your consideration of selecting Denver Colorado as the finalist for the National Medal of
Honor Museum
Sincerely yours,
Adam Shake

It is with great enthusiasm that the Durango Area Tourism Office supports Denver as the location for the
National Medal of Honor Museum. Many Colorado cities, both large and small, have a strong attraction
for Patriot Tourism. Pueblo is the “Home for Heroes” and has four Congressional Medal of Honor
recipients. The small town of Collbran houses the only Women’s War Memorial. There is a Vietnam War
Memorial in Fruita, which is also a small town near the Utah border. The Vail area was the original
training ground for the 10th Mountain Division, and of course, the Air Force Academy and the new U.S
Olympic Museum in Colorado Springs attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.
We are very excited about the proposed location for the museum in the center of Denver, which is a
cultural hub and has the benefit of easy access to many other wonderful Denver museums. Visitors will
love the “warm western hospitality” of Denver, the Mile-High City! We are very proud of our
Capital/Gateway City and region, which sees more than 32 million visitors annually.
Colorado tourism continues to grow steadily. We would sincerely hope that you would want to take
advantage of this upward trend by placing the museum in Denver. In addition we, as tourism
professionals, collaborate very effectively on a statewide level and feel that we can also assist in
promoting the museum through our Visitor Centers, the development of statewide itineraries oriented
towards “Patriot Tourism” and at the many tradeshows that we attend annually to promote Colorado
and our destinations.
We sincerely hope that you will select Denver to receive the prestigious honor of being the location for
this amazing museum.
With best regards,
Barbara J. Bowman
Interim Executive Director
Durango Area Tourism Office

Dear Mr. Daniels:
On behalf of the Ouray Tourism Office, I would like to extend our enthusiastic support to the selection of
the City of Denver as the location for the National Medal of Honor Museum. The State of Colorado values
its strong military history and active military personnel from the U.S. Air Force Academy, to the story of
the 10th Mountain Division, to Fort Carson’s active installation and Pueblo’s Medal of Honor Plaza.
Locating the National Medal of Honor Museum in the center of Colorado’s capital city offers a unique
setting that will maximize visitor attendance and engagement. The proposed location is at the City’s
cultural and historic hub near the Colorado Capitol and Civic Center Park is in close proximity to the
History Colorado Center, Denver Art Museum and the Kirkland Museum of Fine and Decorative Art. Many
hundreds of thousands of visitors, including tens of thousands of Colorado schoolchildren, visit these sites
annually. Our own small school district in Ouray sends their students on a Denver trip to visit the Capitol
and other key sites annually and I know this museum would be a valuable addition to their Colorado,
governance and United States history-focused trip.
Colorado is also a collaborative state. Businesses and cultural organizations alike cite the synergies and
value of Coloradoans working together and know that a rising tide lifts all boats. You can be assured that
Colorado’s cultural organizations and communities will come together to support the National Medal of
Honor Museum because we understand that working together makes life in Colorado better for everyone.
A part of this is our welcoming Mile High Hospitality. The Colorado Tourism Office is providing
complimentary Colorado Concierge training to all frontline employees, to share a welcoming environment
for all. The museum and its visitors can expect a warm welcome in partnership with this program.
The Denver region, which includes Aurora and Lakewood, attracts more than 32 million visitors annually,
and those numbers have grown consistently year over year. The same is true for most of our other key
state destinations and this robust tourism industry would help to ensure that the National Medal of Honor
Museum would be well attended and receive the attention it so richly deserves.
We hope that you will consider this as you make your final decision on the National Medal of Honor
Museum location. We know that Colorado and Denver will welcome you with honor and all the support
that this museum deserves. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,

Katharina Papenbrock
Executive Director

Dear National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation,
Thank you for considering Denver as the future site for the National Medal of Honor Museum.
Colorado has long been a destination for explorers. We continue to attract visitors who are
eager to be inspired both by our state’s rugged beauty and cultural heritage. Each year the
state sees growth in our tourism sector and our appeal as an authentic, welcoming
destination grows. Our state is the proud home of the U.S. Air Force Academy and our
mountains inspired the words for “America the Beautiful”. The honor of hosting the Museum
would be one more way Colorado stands out as an inspiring, unique American destination.
The proposed location for the museum sits in the heart of Downtown Denver, an area that
hosts visitors from around the world to experience art, culture, history and features one of the
most prominent capital buildings in the nation. The area serves as a link to our past and the
potential for our future, celebrates creativity and diversity and so much of the vibrancy that
makes our country great.
Colorado is steeped in history of patriotism and rugged determination. Here in the mountains,
the 10th Mountain Division shares a storied place in our history, providing many examples of
where veterans have left their mark. They established ski areas, opened ski schools and left
recreation opportunities for generations to enjoy. Even in the most remote region of the state,
the impact of veterans can be felt.
We would be honored for Colorado to host this new museum. We believe that through the
stories of heroes of the past, this museum will inspire the heroes of the future.

Dear Mr. Daniels,
The Metro Mayors Caucus, representing forty mayors and nearly two and one half million Coloradans in
the Denver Metropolitan region, is pleased to offer our highest level of support for the location of the
National Medal of Honor Museum in Denver, Colorado. Our region and state have a long, strong and proud
record of supporting our military and our Veterans, and the location of the National Medal of Honor
Museum would quickly become a landmark in our state and provide inspiration to future generations.
Colorado is a magnetic center with a proud military heritage, and home to over 375,000 Veterans. The
National Medal of Honor Museum would be complemented by the existing assets and installations located
throughout the Centennial State representing the armed forces and paying homage to those who have
served, including the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, and the Pueblo Medal of Honor Memorial at
the Pueblo Convention Center.
Denver, Colorado’s geographic location would provide an assessible location for residents around the
country to visit this prestigious museum. The proposed Denver location near Civic Center Park
represents a uniquely connected site within a thriving contemporary American city. The site is
distinctively located near many other cultural and historic attractions providing visitors an exceptional
opportunity to visit multiple sites within an easy stroll.
We thank the National Medal of Honor Foundation Board of Directors for your thoughtful consideration
of Denver, Colorado.
Yours very truly,

Re: National Medal of Honor Museum
Dear Jeff,
I’m writing to convey the support of the Boulder Chamber and the Boulder Economic Council for Denver’s candidacy as
the new location of the National Medal of Honor Museum.
There are many reasons to select Denver and Colorado, but one of the most compelling is the close-knit and
collaborative nature of our metropolitan area. Locating the National Medal of Honor Museum in Denver would, by
virtue of our regional cohesiveness, be celebrated by all residents of the metro region.
Boulder is a proactive advocate of our metro-wide regionalism, in particular our contribution to the Denver and
Colorado tourist economies. Like Colorado and Denver, Boulder has become a popular destination for international
visitors. At the same time, our state and region are increasingly attractive as destinations for local visitors planning
“staycations”.
I’m confident that by locating the National Medal of Honor Museum in Denver it would benefit from these notable
advantages of the metro region and the State of Colorado. Of course, I’m certain that the National Medal of Honor
Museum in Denver would enhance Colorado’s appeal to overnight visitors and that it would become a much-loved
addition to the culture of our regional community.
Thank you for OEDIT’s leadership as an advocate for Denver in the location selection process for the National Medal of
Honor Museum. Please let us know if there’s any way we can support your efforts on behalf of the Denver region and
our state.
Regards,

Clif Harald

Dear Mr. Daniels and Distinguished Board of Directors,
First of all, Mr. Daniels, thank you for your tireless efforts in the planning, construction, development and
operations of the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City. Clearly, your work has deeply seated
purpose. And, thank you all very much for your consideration of Denver as a finalist for the National Medal of
Honor Museum - an honor in itself. Having spent the first 26 years of my life in Denver, I can genuinely say that
the city is second to none if your goal is for more Americans to understand, embrace, admire and be eternally
grateful for those who have raised their right hand, served, sacrificed and given life and limb for our country.
I have had the good fortune of landing back in Colorado after twenty years on the east coast – in Telluride, about
six hours by car, or less than an hour with direct flights from Denver. Here, in the most breathtaking alpine
environment, the Telluride Adaptive Sports Program (TASP) has made a significant commitment to providing
programming and services to active military and veterans with disabilities. Each year, TASP provides all-expense
paid or heavily subsidized programming to over 100 disabled service men or women, which accounts for roughly
a quarter of its programming. These dynamic experiences span rock climbing among snowcapped peaks,
handcycling through desert sandstone, and skiing down world-renowned steeps. TASP proudly provides these
diverse recreational opportunities by partnering with organizations such as the Wounded Warrior Project or
Semper Fi in order to provide top quality experiences to those who have served and live with a disability. TASP
continually seeks out new military endeavoring partnerships with likeminded organizations in order to further
support our country’s service members with disabilities.
Back in Denver, on the rational side, you have the gateway to our state with more than 35 million passengers
through Denver International Airport and 32 million visitors in metropolitan Denver. That, coupled with the
state’s commitment to locating the museum in the heart of its civic district perfectly complements the organic,
ever-growing nature of the museum – providing visitors with multiple reasons to return and a profoundly
meaningful perspective in a state that speaks loudly to the natural wonders of our great country.
As a state, we welcome the opportunity to become a success story and partner for the National Medal of Honor
Museum and its patriotic purpose.
Best,

Dear Joe & members of the board,
It is my pleasure to support Denver and Colorado’s effort to be the new home of the National
Medal of Honor Museum.
Colorado is a welcoming state, where Mile High Hospitality isn’t just an expression. Our tourism
office is providing complimentary Colorado Concierge training to all frontline employees, to
share a welcoming environment for all. The museum and its visitors can expect a warm
welcome.
As you likely know, Denver and the state of Colorado is a vibrant community with a long history
of alignment with your efforts. Colorado has strong attraction for Patriot Tourism, from the story
of the 10th Mountain Division in our mountain communities to the U.S. Air Force Academy and
new U.S. Olympic Museum in Colorado Springs and much more.
The proposed location for the National Medal of Honor Museum in the center of Colorado’s
capital city offers a unique setting that maximizes visitor attendance. Located near the Colorado
Capitol and Civic Center Park and in close proximity to the History Colorado Center, Denver Art
Museum and the Kirkland Museum of Fine and Decorative Art, the National Medal of Honor

This letter is in support of Denver as the home of the new National Medal of Honor Museum.
As a former co-chairman of the 2008 Medal of Honor Convention in Denver, both the citizen community
and its corporations graciously supported the event with a $1.25 million budget.
Downtown Denver is a fantastic location for the museum, it is already a prime visitor location for
families, school-aged children and international visitors. The museum will be an added amenity and
place of great honor in our thriving city. Denver is idyllic due primarily to its nearly central location in our
country, served by major interstate routes and our international airport.
The immediate surrounding area of Denver is home for a number of prominent military installations.
Our veteran community is both strong, diverse and engaged.
As founder of the Saluting America program, which honors military service past and present, the area
schools participated by drafting personal messages of “thanks” to active and retired military. This
program supports and encourages interactions among K-12 students, veterans and active military
through classroom and school-wide activities that educate, inform, and raise awareness of the sacrifices
made to maintain America’s freedoms. A museum focusing on the Medal of Honor and it’s recipients in
Denver would be a fantastic field trip site for this program and would make an incredible impact on our
young people.
In 2008, I created a Medal of Honor exhibit that was on display for five weeks at the Cherry Creek
Shopping Center. It attracted many thousands of visitors, some of whom returned to view it more than
once.
I have spent a great deal of my career striving to make sure that our veterans are honored and
remembered for their service and sacrifice. I strongly hope that Denver, my home, will be selected for
this very important museum.

Dear Joe Daniels and the National Medal of Honor Museum Board of Directors,
The Colorado Campground & Lodging Owners Association encourages you to select Denver as the home
to the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation.
Nationally in 2016, the camping industry hosted 40.5 million Americans, and the Rocky Mountain region
had the highest participation (no pun intended). With Colorado already situated high on the radar of
travelers, of whom many have military ties, we believe your museum would then easily be added to
their list of interest.
Colorado’s approximate 500 campgrounds and RV parks cater to outdoor enthusiasts from all over,
including countless many who serve or have served in our country’s armed forces.
A large number of these businesses are open all year, offering enjoyable services to our portion of the
85.2 million Colorado visitors (2018).
Colorado’s campgrounds and RV park stand ready to welcome your visitors, and we believe many who
already have Colorado on their radar would appreciate adding your National Medal of Honor Museum
Foundation to their travel plans.

Sincerely,

Mary Arlington

RE: Letter in Support of the establishment of the Medal of Honor Museum in Denver, Colorado.
As Mayor of one of the great military communities in the United States, I want to offer my
heartfelt support for the establishment of the Medal of Honor Museum in Denver, Colorado. As
proud home to five vital military installations in Fort Carson, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson
Air Force Base, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force and the world-famous U.S. Air Force Academy,
Colorado Springs will clearly provide a rich market for visitors to the Medal of Honor Museum.
While the U.S. Military has made troop reductions elsewhere, in Colorado Springs, the military
community has consistently grown for a solid 60 years. The assignment of a new Stryker
Brigade just this year, and the current headquartering of U.S. Space Command are signs that
this growth will only continue.
Additional notable commands located in Colorado Springs include NORAD, U.S. Northern
Command, U.S. Army Space & Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Command, Missile
Defense Integration & Operations Center, and the Joint Interagency Combined Space
Operations Center (JICSPOC).
All told, over 40,000 service members and 80,000 veterans call the Pikes Peak region home.
And Fort Carson calls us the “Best Hometown in the Army.” It’s on their signs.
Thousands of visitors already flock to Colorado Springs for its military community. Over 4,400
AFA cadets and their families come for graduation, football games and change of command
ceremonies; 30,000 soldiers and officers bring friends and family members to the almost 80year-old Fort Carson; countless veterans come to the area to visit four Veteran Affairs Health
facilities, and the number of retired military working second careers in our booming aerospace
and defense industries are difficult to count. Simply put, the Medal of Honor Museum will not
look far for throngs of visitors with a location so close to Colorado Springs.

It is said that out of the hundreds of thousands of service members stationed in Colorado
Springs apparently one in three will want to retire in Colorado Springs. As the community just
named the #1 “Best for Vets: Places to Live” by the Army Times, and the #1 “Most Desirable
Place to Live” by U.S. News & World Report, that’s not too surprising.
Finally, Colorado Springs has one of the highest concentrations of high-ranking military
positions in the nation with over 30 active general officers and hundreds of retired GOs. They
will be an influential voice for the Medal of Honor Museum.
On behalf of the City of Colorado Springs, and its 120,000 active duty and retired service
members, we ask you to select Denver as the best location for the Medal of Honor Museum.

It will have a roughly $150 million capital budget
It will be of the size, scope and scale and magnitude of a Museum on the National Mall
in Washington DC
It is a unique once in a generation opportunity to bring an extraordinary National
Museum to Colorado
The Museum will tell the compelling stories of more than 3500 Medal of Honor
Recipients our nation’s highest and bravest from the Civil War to the present designed to
engage with all ages but particularly youth and young adults to help build strong values
of service, sacrifice and valor above and beyond the call of duty
○ The Museum will highlight the contributions of service members who suffered
incredible losses, many of whom were disabled during their service.
Denver Colorado is one of two semi-finalists for the project. The other is Arlington,
Texas.
The Museum Board is scheduled to pick a final location by October 2 so time is of the
essence.

Why is the Museum Important to the State?
●

●
●

●
●

●

Governor Polis recognizes the economic impact and national prestige that the museum
adds to our community and has provided his full support to the Museum including
offering highly subsidized rent on state land and other financial incentives
The Museum will add an extraordinary new tourism draw to Colorado attracting more
visitors, state sales tax revenue and jobs.
The Museum will have deep community engagement particularly with school districts,
younger Coloradans, and future generations of Coloradans to promote courage and
character and strong values
The Museum will have a high attraction to Colorado’s abundant military personnel and
veterans
Colorado is planning a state-wide and regional tourism campaign “a trail of heroes” from
Pueblo (home to heroes) to Colorado Springs (US Olympics and Air Force Academy) to
the Eagle County (Camp Hale the Home of the 10th Mountain Division and the birth of
the US Ski Industry)
The Museum will be an extraordinary prestigious asset for Colorado

What is the High Level Economic Impact of the Project?
●
●

Attachment: MOHMuseum Project Briefing (3939 : Approval of National Medal of Honor Museum Sub-lease)

High Level Description of the Project

The Museum is aiming to attract a million visitors a year.
At full operation, the museum will likely support around 300 ongoing jobs. In the first 5
years, The Museum will create 150 ongoing Jobs at an Average Annual Wage of
$67,900

Packet Pg. 126

●

●

The Museum will generate millions of dollars a year in net new sales tax revenue to the
State of Colorado, City of Denver, RTD, the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District and
other metro area municipalities and counties and help keep our visitor offerings fresh
and competitive
The Museum will generate hundreds of construction jobs from its $150 million capital
budget.

What is the Beneficial Economic Impact of the Project on RTD?
●

●

●
●

OEDIT estimated based on economic models of similar museums’ financial impact on
net new out-of-state visitors that this museum​ ​will generate between $600,000 and
$3,000,000 per year in new sales tax revenue to the Regional Transportation District
alone​ ​which has a 1% sales tax in the 8 Counties Served by RTD.
○ The estimate above ​does not include​ the following fiscal benefits which would
also be generated by the Museum:
■ New sales tax revenue from in-state but out-of-district Museum visitors
and school districts that travel into Denver specifically for the experience,
or
■ New ridership and fare-box revenue generated by visitors to the Museum
(e.g. Visitors taking the University of Colorado A-Line from the Airport to
Denver to see the Museum or bus lines into Civic Center Station).
Our ability to attract the Museum’s interest in Colorado, is in part, based on all the
investments our region has made in infrastructure and transportation and this will
reinforce ridership and revenue to help keep our infrastructure viable.
The Museum will be located right across from Civic Center Station and will increase use
of the bus lines, Mall Shuttle and Circulator that serve the station.
The Museum is intended to be a catalyst to walkability and vibrancy in downtown
Denver.

Why is the RTD Land Important to the Museum?
●
●
●

●

The Museum itself would be located on state land on the north east corner of Lincoln
and Colfax (current a parking lot)
The RTD site is directly across Colfax from the Proposed Museum site
The Museum needs the RTD site to provide a reverent, public space, programmed to
deliver a thoughtful and purposeful entry to frame the Museum in a manner that is
consistent with world-class public museums. This ability to deliver a reflective public
space similar to those that surround our nation’s top museums and monuments is a core
part of Colorado’s value proposition to the Museum.
Without access to this site, Colorado advances a proposal that lacks a key real estate
differentiator and we will lose the Museum to Arlington, Texas​.

The Museum Board is very sensitive to a lack of political support as they previously had
a deal to site the Museum in Charleston South Carolina but the local City Council backed
out and killed the deal.
It is important to send a strong signal of support to the Museum leadership that all of
Colorado including the RTD board is strongly behind this project.

Who is the Team Building the Museum?
●

●
●

The Museum team is headed by the distinguished CEO Joseph C. Daniels who was the
President and CEO of the National September 11th Memorial & Museum at the World
Trade Center site in lower Manhattan.
○ Mr. Daniels led the fundraising, planning, development, construction and
operation of the September 11 Museum and Memorial for Mayor Bloomberg.
The Museum Board includes distinguished members and ex-members of the military,
including Medal of Honor winners and business leaders.
The Museum’s honorary advisory board includes all four living ex-Presidents of the
United States.

The RTD Board voted 7-7 regarding this 56-year sublease. All RTD actions require a vote of eight or more to be approved.
The only matter at hand was discussion was the park, not the museum land. No board member expressed any
opposition to the museum. To my knowledge, everyone is in support of the proposed museum. The only question is
where the park should be located.
A logical, larger and more suitable alternative exists to fit the needs of the park sought by the National Museum for
Medal of Honor Foundation. This alternative, located just 100' away from the proposed museum is called Veterans
Lincoln Memorial Park and dedicated as a National Historic Landmark in April 2013.
Veterans Lincoln Memorial Park is a full city lot with 133,000 SF, complete with gorgeous and established trees, grass,
ADA compliant sidewalks and two memorials dedicated to those who made sacrifices for our country and to establish
freedom. In addition to the existing Veterans' memorials noted below, the Liberty Bell is also located in the park.
The first and most notable memorial currently in this park is dedicated to Joe P. Martinez. Mr. Martinez served as a
Private in the US Army and posthumously received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in the Aleutian
Islands during World War II. He was the first Hispanic-American and first Coloradan to receive the Medal of Honor during
WWII.
In addition to this existing Congressional Medal of Honor memorial, Veterans Lincoln Memorial Park also has the
Colorado Veterans' Memorial and a replica of the Liberty Bell, of which one was distributed to each state in the 1950s.
Veterans Lincoln Memorial Park has 133,000 SF compared to the gravel lot at 6,600 SF. Walking distance to the
proposed museum would be very comparable to Lincoln Park versus the RTD leased gravel lot. Existing infrastructure is
available at Veterans Lincoln Memorial Park, including water and lighting.

Dear Board of Directors . . .
My name is Tony Owens and I am writing to express my deepest concern and regrets that the lease of a sliver of land,
that RTD owns, was voted down for the purpose of the National Medal of Honor Museum. I find it incredulous that so
many of you, sided with Ms. Kate Williams in denying the lease for such a worthy cause. I can assure you that unless this
vote is reconsidered, and an affirmative vote is taken, there are many many individuals, living within the RTD District,
that will work tirelessly to see that this will be the final term of any dissenting vote on the Board on the reconsideration .
. . and I will be one of them.
I have volunteered to be a Guardian on the Rocky Mountain Honor Flights which four times a year take WWII and
Korean Conflict veterans to Washington DC for a three day visit to see the memorials dedicated in their honor. I, and
every other Guardian pay our own expenses for the flight, meals, and hotel. The veterans incur absolutely no cost at all.
We push these vets in wheelchairs . . . we see to their every need. We do this to somehow pay back to them for all they
did to keep our country . . . YOUR country . . . free. I will be going on my fifth Honor Flight next month.

On a flight in 2018, we had a WWII vet that landed in one of the very first assaults on the beaches of Normandy on D
Day. I pushed a veteran in a wheelchair and as I led him in front of the Viet Nam Memorial, he opened a small plastic
container of black sand that he had tucked away when he landed on the beach of Iwo Jima on the first day and let me
touch that sand. Another WWII veteran was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for capturing six German
soldiers that were reporting the coordinates of American attempts to build a pontoon bridge. With each attempt, the
Germans reported the location to artillery far behind them and the bridges were always destroyed before they could be
completed so troops could cross. This veteran interrogated the six German soldiers and was able to get the the location
of the Nazi artillery and it was neutralized.
I am but one person who is asking you to carefully . . .carefully . . . reconsider this vote. Trust me, there are many, many
more whose memories will remain indelibly etched on the names of those of you that will vote again to not lease this
vacant piece of land for such an honorable and sacred cause.
Sincerely,
Tony Owens
