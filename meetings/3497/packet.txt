BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Amended Budget

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2023, to amend and appropriate funds
to decrease the 2023 Amended Budget by $117.2 million to $2,092.9 million.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
BACKGROUND
RTD may amend its annual budget at any time during the fiscal year, with Board approval. Budget
amendments are requested primarily when new information or unplanned activities arise, since the
Approved Budget appropriation, that require additional funding, reductions to funding or reallocation of
funds to the appropriate projects, accounts and cost centers. RTD’s budgetary controls require Board
appropriation of funding in order to authorize staff to expend those funds for specified needs.
DISCUSSION
The 2023 Adopted Budget was appropriated by the Board in November 2022. This budget amendment
reflects changes that have occurred in the intervening period to adjust for revised revenue assumptions
and modifications to certain expenditure appropriations.
Fiscal Policy Adherence
The Board approved the 2023 Fiscal Policy in October 2022. The following are key components of the
2023 Fiscal Policy and explanations regarding the extent to which this 2023 Amended Budget adheres
to those requirements:
RTD will contract with a third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts: The 2023 Amended
Budget includes the March 2023 sales and use tax forecast from the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business
Priority will be given to replacement of existing, backlog and deferred assets before consideration
of new assets: The 2023 Amended Budget provides funding for maintenance and replacement
needs according to the Transit Asset Management Plan

Packet Pg. 35

16.A

RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance equivalent to three months of operating expenses,
excluding depreciation, for unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs as well as to
mitigate service disruptions during economic downturns: The 2023 Amended Budget fund
balance exceeds three months of operating reserves
RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (revenues available for debt service
after subtracting operating expenses) of 1.2 times: The 2023 Amended Budget results in a 1.5
times revenue coverage ratio
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Below and attached are summaries and details, respectively, of the changes between the 2023 Adopted
Budget and 2023 Amended Budget appropriations requested.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report
to Governance

July 7, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Regional Transportation District’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report, that includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2022.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager, Accounting
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The audit firm Plante Moran, PLLC, performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required by
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2022 and 2021 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action.

June 27, 2023
Chair Guissinger and Board Members
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning RTD’s finances. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations,
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both
to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable
information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The cost
of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal
controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial
statements will be free from material misstatement. As the General Manager and CEO, I assert
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all
material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only
on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and
legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s
separately issued Single Audit Report.

GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in
conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
RTD provides public mass transportation service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver metropolitan region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the
best method to ensure the continuation of this vital service. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of
Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.09 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents
to serve four-year staggered terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 207,000 residents
per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the
agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
In 2022, RTD employed 2,609 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight-county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride”, fixed route bus and commuter rail services employing 1,910 individuals. Besides
its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding
purchased transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood,
and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities
of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation
established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the financial reporting
entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried Employee 401(a)
Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget
sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service,
and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot
legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All
departments of RTD are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager
and CEO on or before August of each year. The General Manager and CEO uses these requests
as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager and CEO then
presents this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15. The Board

of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a final
budget no later than December 31.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain line-item transfers
within the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information
Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most
populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver
Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse mix of
industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic
balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2023 report forecasts that the outlook for the
economy is clouded by emerging challenges. Although economic activity has rebounded and
exceeded pre-pandemic levels, employment has not recovered in several hard-hit industries.
Increasing inflation, supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and concerns about the
escalating conflict in the Ukraine all point to the potential for an economic downturn.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators for the Denver Metro Area
(Inflation is based on National numbers):

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a constitutional amendment known as
the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), that limits taxes, revenue, and spending for state and local
governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District
exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and
spending limitations for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of

the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and
use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any revenue and
spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income generated by
the increased tax revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements
included in the FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s
sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed
through FasTracks and the TABOR restriction exemption will expire.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP),
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement forecasting plan for RTD including both
the Base System and FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation
planning program for the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). While the MTFP is developed separately for the Base System and
FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium and long-range Financial Plan which
includes the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the
development of RTD’s annual budget. In September 2022, the Board of Directors approved the
2023-2028 MTFP.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
activities and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals
and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 found

17.B.b

no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its 1.0% sales and use taxes. Base
System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa1”, by
Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”. FasTracks Bonds that
are secured by a first lien on the districts 0.4% sales tax and a subordinate lien on the 0.6% sales
tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AA+”
and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
investments for the year was 1.4%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile, general liability and felonious
assault. RTD is self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $424,000 per person and
$1,195,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute for
claims arising on or after January 1, 2022. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation
claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this covered by purchased insurance up
to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a commuter rail railroad
liability policy of $323,000,000 to cover the cap on damages set by federal law; a Commercial
Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)
Testing Performance Bond; $4,000,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond; fiduciary coverage on the
Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare
Union Trust, and the employees administering the health benefits program for salaried employees
with a limit of $8,000,000 and Cyber Liability policy with a limit of $10,000,000.

OTHER INFORMATION
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. RTD will submit its 2022 Report for award
of this Certificate.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must
publish an easily readable and efficiently organized Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the
contents of which must conform to program standards. This report must also satisfy both GAAP
and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. It is my belief the current Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report meets the program’s requirements and RTD will be submitting it
to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Timely preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report was
made possible by the dedicated services of the Finance Department led by Doug MacLeod, Chief
Financial Officer. I extend my sincere appreciation to each member of the department for their
contributions. Moreover, I thank the Board of Directors for its governance.

Sincerely,

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Report on the Audits of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and fiduciary activities of the Regional
Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements, as listed in
the table of contents.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the accompanying financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type
activities and fiduciary activities of the District as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the respective changes in
its financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of the Regional Transportation District Salaried Employees Pension Plan
(the "Salaried Pension Plan"), a fiduciary fund of the District, which represents 78.1 percent, 78.1 percent, and
58.1 percent of the assets, net position, and revenue, respectively, of the fiduciary activities for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors, whose report has been furnished
to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Salaried Pension Plan, is based solely
on the report of the other auditors. The financial statements of the Salaried Pension Plan were not audited under
Government Auditing Standards.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The financial statements of the Salaried
Pension Plan were not audited under Government Auditing Standards.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Note A to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the District
adopted the provisions of GASB Statement No. 87, Leases. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern
for 12 months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise
substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and, therefore, is not a
guarantee that audits conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a
substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing audits in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audits.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are

appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that
we identified during the audits.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplementary information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management
and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in
an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Supplemental Information
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the District's basic financial statements. The supplemental information, as identified in the table of
contents, is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In
our opinion, the supplemental information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements as a whole.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. The
other information comprises the introductory and statistical sections but does not include the basic financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audits of the basic financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the basic financial
statements or whether the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work
performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required
to describe it in our report.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated June 27, 2023 on our
consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is
solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting and
compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of its financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in RTD’s financial position. It should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of
dollars.
Financial Highlights
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, emerged. The virus
subsequently spread globally resulting in a worldwide pandemic and caused significant disruptions to the
economy and public transit. As a result of COVID-19, RTD experienced a significant reduction in ridership,
fare revenues and its largest source of revenues, sales and use taxes beginning in March 2020. While
ridership and fare revenue recovered to a certain extent in 2021 and tax collections increased, RTD
experienced a stabilization of late 2021 ridership and fare revenue levels throughout 2022. Tax collections
have been robust and continued to grow in 2022 while expenditures moderated in connection with lower
service levels effectuated by RTD’s implementation of the System Optimization Plan (SOP). RTD continued
to be challenged with inflationary pressures, supply chain issues and a very competitive labor market during
2022.
Beginning in 2020, RTD was apportioned federal COVID-19 relief grant funding through the Coronavirus,
Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, followed by 2021 COVID-19 relief grant apportionments
through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) and,
subsequently, another federal COVID-19 relief grant apportionment through the American Rescue Plan Act
(ARPA). These apportionments totaled $792,873 and were awarded to RTD to be used to sustain transit
operations during the Pandemic. Through 2022, $739,849 (93.3%) of these grant apportionments were
drawn to pay for employee compensation, contracted services and fuel.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,558,484 and $3,462,416, respectively. The amount of
unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2022, was $480,405 compared to $252,166 in 2021. RTD’s
2022 unrestricted net position was positively impacted by expenditure reduction efforts in response to the
impact of COVID-19, improved sales and use tax collections as well as additional federal COVID-19 relief
funding.
The net position of RTD increased by $96,068 (2.8%) during the current year compared to an increase of
$100,423 (3.0%) in the previous year. The increase in both years was primarily due to the aforementioned
cost reductions, tax collections and federal funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In addition,
RTD completed a refinancing of its 2014 Certificates of Participation, for interest savings, and realized
additional investment income due to rising interest rates.
RTD experienced an approximate 70% decrease in ridership due to COVID-19 beginning in March 2020
followed by a recovery to a level of approximately 40% less than the period preceding the Pandemic.
Ridership levels are a key determinant of fare revenue collections; however, fare revenue has become a
less-significant source of funding for RTD.

RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were
negatively impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19 in 2020 with a 4.1% decrease followed by a
19.6% increase in 2021 and a 13.0% increase in 2022.
For 2022, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $971,674 compared to a loss of $826,288 for 2021. The increase in operating loss for 2022
was primarily due to increased operating expenses from restored services, contractual wage increases and
recognition of additional expenses associated with retirement plans. RTD anticipates operating losses each
year, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $223,814 (6.9%) and decreased $66,505 (2.0%) in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Outstanding debt decreased in 2022 and 2021 due to payment of outstanding principal balances and
refinancing of outstanding obligations for interest savings and reduction of outstanding principal.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $1,523 (8.9%) in 2022 and decreased $79,008 (82.1%) in
the previous year. The decrease in both years was a result of lower capital grant eligible expenditures as
the FasTracks capital expansion project winds down.
Grant operating assistance increased $7,990 (2.7%) in 2022 due to modestly higher grant draws from
COVID-19 relief apportionments. Grant operating assistance decreased $17,796 (5.6%) in 2021 due to a
lower federal grant apportionment than in 2020. This federal COVID-19 relief funding was 93.3% drawn
at the end of 2022 and no additional similar COVID-19 operating assistance grants are anticipated.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $337,952 (5.4%) in 2022 and decreased $296,065
(4.5%) in 2021 primarily due to depreciation.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting are used. Revenue is recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.
The statements of net position present information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net
position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position present information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital
grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current

24

Packet Pg. 96

17.B.b

fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows report cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,342 square mile area (District) in
and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and a 0.4%
sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services
in the Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and
maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced transit services in the District.
Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance, investment
income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

*GASB 87 was implemented in the current year which resulted in an adjustment to beginning net position
as described in footnote A.

In 2022, current assets decreased by $121,049 (11.8%) primarily due to additional funding of a portion of
unfunded pension liabilities as well as additional principal payments on outstanding debt.
In 2022, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $337,952 (5.4%) primarily due to the
depreciation of assets.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $127,063 (3.0%) in 2022 primarily due to debt service
payments reducing outstanding obligations.
The net position of RTD increased by $96,068 (2.8%) during 2022 compared to an increase of $100,423
(3.0%) in the previous year. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to increased tax collections and federal
funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The increase in 2021 was due to cost reductions and
federal COVID-19 relief funding.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 5.8% and 6.7% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares decreased by $3,631 (4.6%) in 2022 compared
to an increase of $2,658 (3.5%) in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was due to Zero Fares for Better Air in
August 2022 for which state grant funding was received and fares were not collected during the month.
The increase in 2021 was due to a modest return of ridership following the most severe impacts from
COVID-19.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.2% and 0.4% of total revenues in
2022 and 2021. This revenue category primarily includes revenues from advertisements on RTD’s buses
and external wraps on light rail vehicles as well as revenue from naming rights. Advertising and other
income decreased $1,490 (35.5%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $1,986 (32.1%) in 2021. The
decreases in both years were primarily due to lower advertising revenues from lower advertisement sales
resulting from COVID-19 impacts to the economy as well as the expiration of a naming rights contract.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 66.3% and 64.7% of RTD’s total revenues in 2022 and
2021, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the District.
Sales and use tax increased $98,172 (13.0%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $124,309 (19.6%) in
2021. The increase in both years resulted from a recovery in spending within the District after the initial
economic shocks of COVID-19. Additional contributing factors included continued population growth, low
unemployment as well as growth in personal income.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 23.8% and 25.5% of total revenues
in 2022 and 2021. Grant operating assistance increased $7,990 (2.7%) in 2022 compared to a decrease
of $17,796 (5.6%) in 2021. The operating assistance is a federal grant revenue program used to perform
capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The revenue
changes in both years resulted from changes in amounts drawn from federal COVID-19 relief grants which
were largely drawn in 2020-2022 to maintain certain operating levels in order to serve ongoing public transit
needs.

Investment Income – Investment income provided -0.1% and 0.2% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021.
Investment income decreased $3,405 (141.8%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $6,564 (73.2%) in
2021. The decrease in 2022 resulted from mark-to-market adjustments with rising interest rates and the
decrease in 2021 was due to the lower interest rate environment.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 2.7% and 1.0% of total revenues in
2022 and 2021. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. Other income increased $22,372 (186.5%) in 2022 compared to an increase
of $1,601 (15.4%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the receipt of a returned credit risk
premium associated with a prior year loan and the increase in 2021 was primarily due to less activity with
asset disposals.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 1.2% and 1.5%
of total revenues in 2022 and 2021. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $1,523 (8.9%) in
2022 and decreased $79,008 (82.1%) in 2021. The decreases in both years resulted from lower
infrastructure expenditures due to completion of FasTracks expansionary projects.

Salaries and wages – Salary and wage expense is one of the largest expense categories accounting for
19.1% and 17.3% of the total RTD expenses in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Salary and wage expenses
increased by $42,248 (22.8%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $8,856 (4.6%) in 2021. The increase in
2022 was due to contractual increases and additional hiring with the restoration of service while the
decrease in 2021 was due to reductions in service and staffing shortfalls due to COVID-19.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 8.8% and 5.7% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Fringe
benefits increased by $44,166 (72.9%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $6,386 (11.8%) in 2021. The
increase in both years was due to higher pension liabilities as well as higher payroll taxes on higher wage
levels.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 3.7% of the total
expenses in both 2022 and 2021. Materials and supplies expenses increased $4,251 (10.7%) in 2022
compared to a decrease of $2,539 (6.0%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was due to restoration of some
service in addition to inflation while the decrease in 2021 was due to reduced service levels due to COVID19.
Services – Services expense accounted for 6.9% of total expenses in both 2022 and 2021. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense increased
$8,305 (11.2%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $10,345 (12.2%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 resulted
from restoration of some service in addition to inflation while the decrease in 2021 resulted from service
expense and project reductions to adjust to lower revenues caused by the COVID-19 economic effects.

Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.5% and 1.6% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Utilities expense
includes electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as traction
power for rail lines. Utilities expense increased $922 (5.3%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $1,306
(8.1%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 resulted from higher traction power costs due to some restored
service while increase in 2021 resulted from the opening of the N Line in 2020.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% and 0.9% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Insurance
expense includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as
the premium cost for excess insurance lines, cybersecurity and railroad liability insurance. Insurance
expense increased $3,117 (30.8%) in 2022 and decreased $82 (0.8%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was
due to state increases in the caps for liability, higher worker’s compensation reserves and restoration of
some service while the decrease in 2021 was due to lower frequency and severity of claims as RTD has
focused additional cost containment efforts in this area.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 16.4% and
16.3% of the total expenses in 2022 and 2021. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for bus, commuter rail, Access-a-Ride, and FlexRide services. Purchased
transportation costs increased $21,269 (12.2%) in 2022 and decreased $29,217 (14.3%) in 2021. The
increase in 2022 was due to some restoration of service and contractual increases and the decrease in 2021
was due to service reductions from COVID-19 impacts.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.1% and 0.2% of total expenses in
2022 and 2021, respectively. Leases and rentals expense decreased $103 (6.3%) in 2022 compared to a
decrease of $1,754 (51.6%) in 2021. The decrease in both years resulted from cost reduction efforts to
mitigate impacts from 1COVID-19 as well as the adoption of GASB 87.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other
defined categories and accounted for 0.3% and 0.2% of total expenses in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Miscellaneous expenses increased $1,050 (47.4%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $333 (13.1%) in
2021. This category includes additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 30.0% and 32.1% of the total expenses
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. RTD’s depreciation expense is a straight-line non-cash systematic allocation
of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense increased
$15,040 (4.4%) in 2022 compared to an increase of $3,334 (1.0%) in 2021. The increase in both years
was due to recognition of amortization expenses related to GASB 87.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 11.6% and 14.4% of the total expenses
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest expense decreased $15,759 (10.2%) in 2022 and decreased
$12,959 (7.8%) in 2021. The decrease in both years was attributable to lower outstanding balances
resulting from paying down principal as well as refinancing of debt for interest savings.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.4% and 0.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other expense

accumulated depreciation in 2022 was $5,965,140 compared to $6,303,092 in 2021. The decrease in capital
assets in 2022 was $337,952 (5.4%) compared to a decrease of $296,965 (4.5%) in 2021. The decrease
in both years was due to additional accumulated depreciation.

2022 outstanding debt also decreasing due to the completion of a refinancing for interest savings.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue bonds,
the 2022 amount which includes the 2022AB Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, were $2,360,680 and

$303,805 (14.8%) in 2022 compared to a decrease of $6,043 (0.3%) in 2021. The increase in 2022 was
a result of the issuance of taxable (convertible to tax-exempt) Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2022AB.
The proceeds from which were used to pay of which were used to pay off all outstanding Series 2014A
Certificates of Participation. The decrease in 2021 was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations
issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation and component unit of

its own debt. Certificates outstanding were $453,994 and $955,782 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $501,788 (52.5%) in 2022 compared to a decrease
of $55,537 (5.5%) in 2021. The decrease in both years is due to payment of outstanding principal.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2022 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 66.3% and 64.7% of the total revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect the level of funding available to
RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2022 sales and use taxes increased 13.0% from the prior year due to
continued recovery from the economic effects of COVID-19.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 5.8% and 6.7% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Passenger fare collections
were significantly impacted by COVID-19 and lower ridership in both years. In August 2022, fares were
suspended for customers in recognition of the Zero Fare for Better Air initiative, however, these foregone
fare revenues were replaced with a Colorado state grant.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 23.8% and 25.5% of total revenues in 2022
and 2021, respectively which represented a more substantial portion of revenues in both years being
attributable to federal COVID-19 relief funding to replace lost revenues while maintaining public transit
service.
Each year, RTD may propose an Amended Budget at any point to the Board of Directors for appropriation
to adjust revenue and expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing economic
conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present budget amendments to the Board of Directors for
approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.
In 2020, RTD reached final completion on the remaining FasTracks Project elements for which funding had
been identified. Additional FasTracks elements approved by the voters of the District have been deferred
due to a lack of current identifiable funding.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this
organization. Questions concerning any information contained in this report may be directed to the RTD

N OTE A – SUM M AR Y OF SIGNI FI CANT ACCOUNTI NG P OLI CI ES
1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by
March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of
RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended requiring RTD to
increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill was
amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private
transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system
under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
General Manager and CEO appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority
serves as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14) and 61
(GASB 61) which provide guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the primary
government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying
financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in
RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. No separately
audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds
GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried
Pension Plan and RTD Salaried 401(a) Retirement Plan meet these fiduciary criteria and has

Packet Pg. 117

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------included the financial activity of each in 2022 and 2021 in the financial statement section of
this report.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its
presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted
resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8. Receivables
Accounts receivables are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other
contractual arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess
of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses
and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata shares of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
Prior to 2020, interest was capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of
participation from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount
of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted)
interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest
earnings on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated
by weighted average construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively was $138,337
and $154,096.
11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:

Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10-20 years
30 years
8-25 years
3-10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the
accompanying financial statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately
$635,609 and $573,783 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized
as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence
is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have been earned
but not paid, have been included as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket books and day pass
tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Stored value sales are evaluated for
revenue recognition at the time services are performed. Sales of college-based passes,
which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned revenue
then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered.
Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given
year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of
each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of months of
the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable
sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the
District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series
2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021A, 2021B, 2022A
and 2022B bond resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of Revenue
and are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service requirements for these obligations
through remittances to a trustee and then remits the remaining balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax
revenues in the amount of approximately $3,735,849 through 2050. Principal and interest
paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $99,115.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). Grants are also awarded to RTD by State of Colorado through the
Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state governments issue grants
to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $12,490 and $15,739 in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $307,042 and $299,052 in 2022 and
2021, respectively. Other contributed revenue was $3,156 and $1,430 in 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
RTD was awarded additional COVID-19 relief funding of $304,227 through the American
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in August 2021. A portion of these funds were also drawn in 2022
and are included in the operating assistance grant revenue.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and
guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate
measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides
a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local
governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments after considering past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies.
19. Leases-GASB 87
RTD is a lessee for noncancellable leases of land, office space and equipment. RTD
recognizes a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the
statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease liability at the present
value of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is
initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs.
Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Key estimates and judgments related to leases include how RTD determines (1) the
discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease
term, and (3) lease payments.
x RTD uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When
the interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, RTD generally uses its
estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
x The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments
included in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed
payments and purchase option price that RTD is reasonably certain to exercise.
RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected
to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability.
Lease assets are reported with other capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with
the short-term portion combined with long-term debt and the long-term portion is stated
separately on the statement of net position.
RTD is a lessor for noncancellable leases of buildings, land, office space, parking space and
use of RTD physical resources for advertising space. RTD recognizes a lease receivable and
a deferred inflow of resources in the statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease receivable at the present
value of payments expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments received. The deferred
inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable,
adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is recognized as revenue over the life of the
lease term.
Key estimates and judgments include how RTD determines the discount rate it uses to
discount the expected lease receipts to present value, lease term, and lease receipts.
x RTD uses the actual rate charged to lessees as the discount rate for leases.
x The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease receipts
included in the measurement of the lease receivable is composed of fixed
payments from the lessee.
RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease receivable and deferred inflows of resources if certain
changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease receivable.
20. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 94
In March 2020, the GASB issued Statement No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public
Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, to bring a uniform guidance on how
to report public-private and public-public partnership arrangements. As a result, transferors
in public-private or public-public arrangements will recognize receivables for installment
payments, deferred inflows of resources, and, when applicable, capital assets. Operators
will recognize liabilities for installment payments and intangible right-to-use assets, and
when applicable, deferred outflows of resources and liabilities for assets being transferred.
This statement also provides guidance for accounting and financial reporting for availability
payment arrangements, in which a government compensates an operator for services such
as designing, constructing, financing, maintaining, or operating an underlying asset for a
period of time in an exchange of exchange-like transaction. The provisions of this statement
are effective for RTD’s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.

GASB 96
In May 2020, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
96, Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements (SBITAs), which defines
SBITAs and provides accounting and financial reporting for SBITAs by governments. This
statement requires a government to recognize a subscription liability and an intangible
right-to-use subscription asset for SBITAs. RTD is currently evaluating the impact this
standard will have on the financial statements when adopted. The provisions of this
statement are effective for RTD’s financial statements for the year ending December 31,
2023.

GASB 99
In April 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
99, Omnibus 2022, which establishes or amends accounting and financial reporting
requirements for specific issues related to financial guarantees, derivative instruments,
leases, public-public and public-private partnerships (PPPs), subscription-based information
technology arrangements (SBITAs), the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate

transactions, pledges of future revenues, the focus of government-wide financial
statements, and terminology. The standard has various effective dates. RTD does not
believe this pronouncement will have a significant impact on its financial statements but is
still making a full evaluation.

GASB 100
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
100, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which enhances the accounting and
financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and error corrections. The
provisions of this statement are effective for RTD's financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2024.

GASB 101
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
101, Compensated Absences, which updates the recognition and measurement guidance
for compensated absences under a unified model. This statement requires that liabilities
for compensated absences be recognized for leave that has not been used and leave that
has been used but not yet paid in cash or settled through noncash means and establishes
guidance for measuring a liability for leave that has not been used. It also updates
disclosure requirements for compensated absences. The provisions of this statement are
effective for RTD's financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024.
21. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements
During the current year, RTD adopted GASB Statement No. 87, Leases. As a result, the
business-type activities now include a liability for the present value of payments expected
to be made and right-to-use assets. The business type activities now include receivables
for the present value of payments expected to be received and deferred inflows of resources
that will be recognized as revenues over the term of the lease.
The effective date for GASB Statement No. 87 was as of January 1, 2021, resulting in a
liability, a right to use asset, a receivable, and a deferred inflow of resources recognized in
the statement of net position as of that date. There was no impact on net position as of
January 1, 2021. There was an impact on net position at the end of 2021 due to the impact
of the standard on components of revenue and expenses in fiscal year 2021. The effect of
the new standard on net position as of December 31, 2021, and therefore January 1, 2022,
was as follows:

N OTE B – DEPOSI TS AND I NVESTM ENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA).
Under this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with
pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or
held in escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by
rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository
and held in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be
held is clearly identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of
public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public
depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained
or pledged and is always entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments
without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $13,436 and
$13,407 collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department
or agent but not in RTD’s name.

The types of investments, which are authorized by RTD’s internal investment policy, include the
following:
1. Obligations of the United States government
2. Obligations of the United States government agencies and United States government
sponsored corporations
3. Municipal notes or bonds that are an obligation of any state of the United States

7. Bankers’ acceptances notes
8. Repurchase agreements
9. Money market funds
10. Local government investment pools
11. Any other investment permitted under Colorado Revised Statute (CRS) 24-75-601 et seq.
Credit ratings of RTD’s portfolio, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, are exhibited in the table
below.
Portfolio holdings adhere to RTD’s investment policy and applicable statute.
Investments rated AAA, AA and A are from the Standard & Poor’s rating service. Investments
rated A-1+/P-1 are from the Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rating services, respectively.
In 2021, RTD invested in a government money market fund with Wells Fargo Bank that is AAAm
rated by Standard and Poor’s and maintains a $1 net asset value (NAV). As of December 31,
2022, the balance in this money market fund was $31,136.

Fiduciary Funds
Fiduciary fund investments of $169,980 and $195,800 at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, consist of a broad spectrum of individual holdings of cash and cash equivalents,
equity mutual funds and fixed income mutual funds. Because these investments are primarily
mutual funds consisting of multiple investments and also contain equity investments, credit
ratings of the underlying portfolios are not available.

Concentration of Credit R isk
Enterprise Funds
It is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment funds
shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a
specific maturity, a specific issue or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the
portfolio should, however, be flexible depending upon the outlook for the economy and the
securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted
investments. As of December 31, 2022, RTD followed these limits. As of December 31, 2021,
RTD was following limitations set out in RTD’s previous investment policy limitations.

Fair Value M easurem ents
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No.
72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local
governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of
governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard
expands fair value disclosures to provide comprehensive information for financial statement
users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD
can access at the measurement date. Examples are derived values from the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ),
Chicago Board of Trade and “Pink Sheets”.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly on the measurement date. Examples include matrix pricing,
market corroborated pricing and inputs such as yield curves and indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on
the reporting entity's reasonably available information concerning the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including assumptions about risk.

(1) Real estate investment trusts invest primarily in commercial and residential real estate. The fund focuses on
properties with high quality physical improvements, stabilized occupancies and competitive positions within their
markets that produce a relatively high level of current income combined with moderate appreciation potential.
(2) The common collective trusts measured at the NAV invest primarily in asset-backed securities, corporate bonds,
U.S. government agency securities and foreign common stocks. The investment objectives include matching the
return of the Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index through investment in substantially all of the bonds contained in that
index and matching the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index (Net) benchmark.
(3) The mutual funds primarily invest in U.S. corporate bonds and U.S. equity securities. The investment objectives
of the U.S. equity securities mutual funds include matching the performance of the Russell Mid-cap Growth Index.
The investment objectives of the U.S. corporate bond funds include matching the return of the Intercontinental
Exchange Bank of America U.S. high Yield Constrained Index through investment in a diversified portfolio of highyield debt securities.

N OTE E – LONG-TER M DEBT
In April 2018, GASB issued Statement 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, Including Direct
The primary objective of GASB 88 related to providing
additional information regarding debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also
clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information statements as a
liability that arises from a contractual obligation to pay cash (or other assets that may be used in
lieu of cash) in one or more payments to settle an amount that is fixed at the date the contractual
obligation is established. GASB 88 requires that additional essential information related to debt
be disclosed in notes to financial statements, including unused lines of credit, assets pledged as
collateral for the debt and terms specified in debt agreements related to significant events of
default with finance-related consequences, significant termination events with finance-related
consequences and significant subjective acceleration clauses.

Borrowings and Direct Placement.

bonds are secured by a 0.4% sales and use tax and a subordinate pledge from the 0.6% Base
System sales tax. Per TABOR, at the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s 0.4% sales and
use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate and maintain the assets financed
through FasTracks. For the year 2022 and 2021, respectively, RTD paid interest and principal for
sales tax revenue bonds of $99,115 and $88,756.

The sales tax bonds are secured by RTD’s 1.0% sales and use tax for which debt service payments
are withheld by a trustee from the monthly remittance prior to the Colorado Department of
Revenue remitting such taxes to RTD. Withholdings are equivalent to a proportionate monthly
amount of the annual principal and semi-annual interest payments and are held by the trustee
until such debt service payments are satisfied.
Certificates are issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation
and component unit of RTD. The Authority issued Certificates with the proceeds used to acquire
certain equipment, facilities and infrastructure to be used by RTD as well as for construction of
the North Metro (N Line) commuter rail line. RTD leases the equipment acquired and elements
constructed with the proceeds from the Certificates under separate master lease purchase
agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates and the capital
lease agreements as its own obligations.

The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU) Pension Plan was established pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU. This plan covers substantially
all full-time union-represented employees in accordance with the CBA. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Compusys, Inc.

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected
by the participant and the spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the ATU Plan are paid to participants who have attained age
65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after attaining age 50. The ATU Plan was
subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011, for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, their beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest.
Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will be paid in a
lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided, he or she has worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An
individual will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social
Security Administration. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify
for a disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided they had worked for
at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if they have worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and
terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years
of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after age
50. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was
revised.

Following signing of new Collective Bargaining Agreement, employer
contributions were increased to 15% of pay effective January 1,2022.
A one-time $160 million contribution was made in 2022 to support an
increased benefit multiplier from 1% to 2% for participants hired
between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022 retroactive to their
hire date and to increase the funding level of the plan to 85%. The
plan closed to new hires effective January 1, 2023.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a single discount rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
6.50%, the municipal bond rate is 1.84% (based on fixed income municipal bonds with 20 years
to maturity that include only federally tax-exempt municipal bonds as reported in Fidelity Index’s
“20-Year Municipal GO AA Index” as of December 31, 2021 and the resulting single discount rate
is 6.50%.

Changes to Assumptions and Benefits
The plan had a loss under Change in Benefit Terms due to a change in plan provisions which
included an increase of employer contributions to 15% and a change in the benefit multiplier
from 1% to 2%, retroactive to the date of hire . There was also an increase in the pension
liability under Change in Assumptions due to a decrease in the assumed discount rate.

Contributions
Contributions are made in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). RTD
signed a new CBA in April 2022, retroactive to January 1, 2022. As part of the new agreement,
RTD made a one-time lump sum contribution of $160,000 in May 2022, reported as a deferred
outflow on the statement of net position to the plan. The plan also had contributions during the
measurement year of $19,498. Employer contributions were increased to 15% as part of the
new CBA from previous 13% contribution. Employee contributions remain at 5%. RTD has

the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/30 for each year less than age 60. If the employee
terminates from active status prior to age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/15 for
each year between ages 60 and 65 and 1/30 for each year less than age 60.
The disability provisions apply to fully vested participants who are totally and permanently
disabled and entitled to a Social Security disability award. The payout amount is the unreduced
accrued normal pension retirement, payable upon approval for Social Security disability.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service, otherwise a lump sum payment will be
made equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits payable in lieu of all other
benefits.
Forms of annuity payments for normal retirement are 50% joint and survivor if married, otherwise
a retirement benefits are for a single annuity with no survivor option. Optional forms of retirement
benefits are 25%, 50%, 66-2/3% or 100% joint and survivor annuity with five year or 10 year
certain and life annuity.
Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and
completed months in the year of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for
retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is the average of the participant's
highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service
immediately preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes
bonuses, severance pay, long-term disability pay and other extra compensation paid in the fiscal
year. Compensation includes deferrals made to the RTD Deferred Compensation Plan and RTD
Flexible Spending Account Plan, overtime, shift differentials, leave pay and salary reductions.

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) salaried employees’ base
compensation. Due to the decreasing active population and resulting reduction in future
expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding policy effective January 1, 2013, where the
recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1 million is made to the Trust each year.
This funding policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032;
however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board adopted a new funding policy effective in
2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed for an amount to be contributed to keep
the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s
Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended contribution can fluctuate annually due to
such factors as projected total base compensation, investment results, and retirement patterns
of participants. RTD contributed $8.4 million in 2022 and $6.1 million in 2021.

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2021
using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with
a liability roll forward to the measurement date of December 31, 2021:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

2.75%
3.70% - 6.45%, based on age
7.00%

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following data and
reflect assumed long-term expected real rates of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the
disclosure is based:

Mortality Rates for Lump Sums (25% Election Assumption)
RP-2014 Mortality tables for healthy employees and annuitants (adjusted to 2006) and projected
to 2022 using the MP-2017 mortality improvement scale, blended 70% male/30% female for
participants and 30% male/70% female for beneficiaries.
The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2021, evaluation were based on the results of an
actuarial experience study covering the period January 1, 2014 – December 31, 2017.

Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not
incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2020,
using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with
a liability roll forward to December 31, 2020:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

2.75%
3.70% - 6.45%, based on age
7.00%

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a
building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return are
developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2021, are summarized in the following data and
reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the
disclosure is based:

Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected
future benefit payments for current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of
return on investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine
the total pension liability. The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year taxexempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an average rating of AA/As or higher).

R TD P lan – Defined Contribution
Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan is available for full-time salaried employees hired after January
1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted Amendment 8, effective January 1, 2008 for which RTD
contributes 7-9% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Contributions totaled $7,191 and $4,314
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to this plan. Membership was
710 and 681 active employees in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust (Trust) was formed
pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971 between Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Division 1001 and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver,
through July 3, 1974 and RTD thereafter. In addition to the original Denver Metro Division,
employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust benefits. The
Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as
there continues to be a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the ATU and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability)
for represented employees of RTD and certain officers of the ATU and health care benefits for
retired employees who actively worked 600 hours or more per quarter. The Trust is funded
through contributions by the employer and employee in which the share of benefit plan
contributions is set by the CBA. RTD’s contribution was $21,061 and $22,780 for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for
felonious assault for each employee. The Trust self-insures part of its health, life insurance and
short-term disability benefits. The Trust issues audited financial statements which include
financial information for the plan. Those audited financial statements may be obtained from the
Trust: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado
80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (Plan), created in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits
them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the
unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement, death or in the
event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle
of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay.

N OTE H – COM M I TM ENTS AND CONTI NGENCI ES
Commitments

Operating Agreement – Purchased Transportation
RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been
leased to and subleased back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a
transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been leased to and subleased back. As part
of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received from each
counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third-party
trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by RTD under
the transactions and are therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.

Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2022, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and
the purchase of buses and light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the
purchase of buses and light rail vehicles total $150,266 and $151,213 in 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements.
At December 31, 2022, RTD had a commitment to provide $72,585 in matching funds in order to
receive $172,344 in future federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific
groups of routes not to exceed 58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January
2022, 55.78% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by private contractors operating
under the auspices and direction of RTD.

ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, RTD was mandated to
provide paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use RTD’s fixed route system.
This service, branded Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb transportation system offered to persons
with disabilities who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Customers eligible
for Access-a-Ride services must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD fixed route.
Since September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the ADA requirement to provide
paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use the fixed route system.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered a public-private partnership (P3) to design, build, finance and operate
several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor (A Line), the Gold Line Rail Corridor

P3 Project.” The Eagle P3 Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement
that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that was selected through a competitive proposal
process. The selected concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), is a special purpose
company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016
and Phase II completed in 2019. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made
scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011 through 2017 for completed project
elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the B
Line in 2016 and began services on the G Line in 2019. Under the terms of the concessionaire
agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017
through 2044 in addition to service payments for the provision of operations and maintenance
services performed by DTP. The principal and interest payments are fixed amounts for the term
of the agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to certain inflation
measurements. In addition, the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes,
special services and certain availability factors.
In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail
Line (N Line). The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that runs from Denver Union
Station through Commerce City, Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North
Adams County. The N Line opened in September of 2020 with service extending to 124th Avenue.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct
the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) Project. SERE includes 2.3 miles extending the existing
Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway
Station featuring a Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking spaces. SERE opened in 2019.

Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
reviews by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Although the outcome of any such review
cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these reviews will not result in liabilities to such
an extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.

Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported
when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee
benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident for claims arising on or after January 1, 2018, and
before January 1, 2022. For claims that arise on or after January 1, 2022, RTD’s liability is limited
to $424 per person and $1,195 per occurrence.
For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims more
than $4,000. The number of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk Management Division determines incurred claims by investigating
the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement
of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and worker’s
compensation during the past year are as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RTD is party to several pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or
labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.
The concessionaire for the Eagle Project, Denver Transit Partners, filed litigation in Denver District
Court asserting claims against RTD based on an alleged change in law. DTP alleged damages for
those claims more than $111,000 and RTD had filed a counterclaim of approximately $30,000.
On February 10, 2023, the Court hearing this case issued judgement, determining that the federal
and state authorities applied existing regulations and enforcement policies when they undertook
the regulatory review of the warning system, of which DTP had argued otherwise. The Court
found that there was no change in law or force majeure event that entitled DTP to relief under
the Concessionaire’s Agreement. This action denied DTP’s $111,000 claim against RTD. At the
same time the Court denied RTD’s $30,000 counterclaim against DTP.
On March 30, 2023, DTP submitted a notice of appeal to the Court in response to the decision.
RTD will continue to vigorously defend its position through the appeal process with the belief RTD
will prevail throughout.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the
budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures
include capital outlays and obligation principal payments and excludes TABOR rebates under
Amendment 1 of the Colorado Constitution, extraordinary loss, and depreciation on, as well as
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed
outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays
for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the RTD General Manager and CEO submits to the Board
of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence of such
adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s
approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the RTD General Manager
and CEO to approve certain transfers within the budget.

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except the RTD Board of Directors has the authority,
as stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry over the unused portion of funds for
capital projects not completed for a period not to exceed three years. As of December 31, 2022,
there was approximately $567,961 of unused 2022 appropriations for capital outlays available for
carryover to 2023.
In 2022, the RTD Board of Directors approved refinancing certain lease-purchase financing
instruments for interest savings by separate resolution independent of the 2022 approved budget
appropriations. The cost of extinguishment of this debt resulted in expenditures exceeding the
initial approved appropriations in 2022.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDI NG AND DEBT LI M I TATI ONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning Amendment 1 through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the
voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined

Southwest Corridor light rail projects or to operate such projects for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment, income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate
will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through FasTracks. RTD
has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to Amendment 1’s limitations. This debt was
authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks transit improvement
program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2021, $25,623 of year-end net position
has been reserved for emergencies. Amendment 1 is complex and subject to judicial
interpretation. RTD believes it follows the requirements of Amendment 1 based on the
interpretations of the amendment’s language available at year-end.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 30, 2023, RTD’s concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), which operates and
maintains certain elements of RTD’s commuter rail services, filed an appeal with the Court
regarding the February 10, 2023, judgement issued regarding litigation between RTD and DTP.
See Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings.
On January 9, 2023, RTD was awarded a federal grant under section 5307 Preventive
Maintenance, totaling $99,650, of which $79,720 is the federal portion. The start date for eligible
costs was 10/1/2021 ending 9/30/2023. The grant will assist RTD in covering costs for preventive
maintenance and capital cost of contracting which helps RTD ensure its transit services are safe
and reliable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A Refunding

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number ____ (the “COP Resolution”), Series
of 2023 authorizing the refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2013A for interest
savings.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the essential assets of the district. Bonds and COPs are referred
to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either taxable or tax-exempt. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2022, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.815 billion.

DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created opportunities
to take advantage of low interest rates.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2023, for debt
service savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the refundings are identified in
the Resolution and include:
• The Preliminary Official Statement
• The Lease
• The Trust Indenture
• The Continuing Disclosure Agreement
• The Certificate Purchase Agreement
Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential Bond Refunding”. The Investor
Information
webpage
can

at
the
following

https://www.rtddenver.com/services/financials-investors
Resolution No. ___ delegates to the General Manager and CEO or the Chief Financial Officer the authority
(effective for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the Series 2023A refunding
certificates of participation, provided that:
1. The aggregate principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant to the Lease
authorized hereunder shall not exceed $51,000,000
2. The maximum aggregate annual amount of Base Rentals payable by the District pursuant to the
Lease authorized hereunder in any Fiscal Year shall not exceed $19,000,000
3. The Lease Term for the Lease shall not extend beyond June 1, 2027, or the average useful life of
the Leased Property related to the Lease, whichever is shorter
4. The maximum net effective interest rate on the interest component of the Base Rentals relating to
the 2023 Certificates shall not exceed 5.00%
5. The present value savings related to the Refunding Project shall not be less than 1.50% of the
principal amount of the 2013A Certificates being refunded
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Two potential benefits of the recommended COPs refunding transaction that will contribute to the
Strategic Priority of Financial Success are:
1. Refinancing COPs Series 2013A will yield potential gross debt service savings of $28.2 million or
a net present value of $1.7 million or 2.5%
2. Using existing COPs Series 2013A debt service reserve fund will reduce outstanding debt by
approximately $23.4 million

against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year. The District

connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain other

the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2023 Certificates shall constitute a
mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current
fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal
year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt
limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other
financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the 2023 Certificates shall be
construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a
donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article
XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the 2023 Certificates shall directly or
indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated for
the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized pursuant
to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2023 Leased Property and do not exceed
a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to renew the Lease
or to exercise its option to purchase the 2023 Leased Property pursuant to the Lease. The Board
hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has an option to purchase
the 2023 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful
life of the 2023 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the
General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding Project
and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the Board hereby
elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of the District its
option to purchase all of the 2013A Leased Property currently encumbered under the 2013A
Indenture and to redeem all of the outstanding 2013A Certificates (the "Refunded Certificates"),
as applicable, on the redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate
related to the Refunding Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the
Refunding Project, the District hereby irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give notice of refunding
and defeasance to the Owners of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with the provisions of
the Sale Certificate, the Indenture of Trust related to the Refunded Certificates and the Escrow
Agreement between the Corporation and the Trustee, as escrow agent.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2023 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2023 Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
FasTracks Bonds, Series 2019A & 2021A Refunding

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Bond Resolution”),
Series of 2023 authorizing the refunding of and tender offer for FasTracks Sales Tax Bonds Series
2019A and 2021A for debt service savings.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations; however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through the collateralization of the underlying asset that was financed. Bonds and COPs are
referred to as RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration, meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either taxable or tax-exempt. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to taxable income while tax-exempt debt is generally
non-taxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference
in interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2022, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.815 billion.

Packet Pg. 213

DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt indicate opportunities to
take advantage of current bond market conditions and differences between taxable and tax-exempt
interest rates.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Project),
Series 2023 for debt service savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the
refundings are identified in the Resolution and include:
Invitation to Tender Bonds
The Preliminary Official Statement
The Trust Indenture
The Continuing Disclosure Agreement
The Escrow Agreement
The Bond Purchase Agreement
The Dealer Management Agreement
Substantially final drafts of the contractual documents are on file and available for review on the RTD
Investor Information webpage under the “Documents for Potential Bond Refunding”. The Investor
Information webpage can be found at the following link: https://www.rtd-denver.com/services/financialsinvestors
Resolution No. ___ delegates to the General Manager and CEO or the Chief Financial Officer the authority
(effective for one year following the date thereof) to prepare or cause to be prepared the 2023 Tender
Offer to all or a portion of the holders of the outstanding 2019A Bonds and the 2021A Bonds and all
related offer materials upon the terms and conditions determined to be in the best interests of the
District and to determine terms of the Series 2021A refunding bonds, provided that:
1. The final maturity of the Bonds shall be no later than November 1, 2038
2. The net effective interest rate of the Bonds shall be less than the combined net effective interest
rate of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds and any Purchased 2019A/2021A Bonds purchased
with proceeds of the Bonds
3. The combined maximum annual repayment cost of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt
issued pursuant to the 2004 Election shall not exceed the maximum annual repayment cost
authorized in the notice of election sent to the voters in connection with the 2004 Election
4. The combined debt service requirements of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt issued
pursuant to the 2004 Election, when combined with the debt service requirements previously
paid for all other debt issued pursuant to the 2004 Election, shall not exceed the maximum total
repayment cost authorized at the 2004 Election
5. The net purchase price of the Bonds shall not be less than 98% of the original principal amount of
the Bonds

Packet Pg. 214

17.D

6. The net present value savings of the Purchased 2019A/2021A Bonds shall not be less than
3.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Purchased 2019A/2021A Bonds, and the net
present value savings of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds shall be (i) greater than zero in the
case of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds which mature on or prior to November 1, 2031 and
(ii) not less than 3.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds
in the case of the Refunded 2019A/2021A Bonds which mature after November 1, 2031
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Execution of this refunding transaction through the use of a tender offer will contribute to the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
Based on recent market conditions, the Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bond, Series 2023A transaction
could generate gross debt service savings of $10.8 million or a net present value of $7.4 million or
4.9%.
If approved by the Board, RTD would solicit current bond holders to sell their bonds to RTD with RTD
having the option to cancel the transaction if an adequate level of participation does not occur. Parties
to this transaction are working on a contingent fee basis, which would result in little to no cost to RTD if
the transaction is canceled.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the Systemwide Fare
Study and Equity Analysis recommended fare changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and
guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The FTA defines a fare
change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation of new
fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.). The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis
includes proposed fare changes that meet this definition. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought
before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report is included in
Attachment A.
RTD’s Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted the Title VI Program
Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating
fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which difference
shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

Packet Pg. 238

17.E

Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is an examination of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed
by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes,
which difference shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership.
A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. The agency will then
analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff presented the draft recommendation for fare structure changes and the draft Title VI fare equity
analysis at the April 11, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting (see attached Board materials).
Subsequently, staff released the draft fare equity analysis to the public for comment in tandem with the
draft recommendation release. There were no associated changes made to the draft recommendation
following the final public comment period.
The following discussion is divided into two sections:
• Final draft Title VI fare equity analysis of proposed fare changes
• Final public outreach and engagement efforts
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis of Proposed Fare Changes
In accordance with Title VI and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducted an equity analysis of the
proposed fare changes to ensure that they do not unfairly impact people of color and low-income
populations. The changes proposed as part the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis, include a
fare restructuring and price reduction, establishment of a Transit Assistance Grant Program, introduction
of a Bulk Purchase Program, establishment of a Semester Pass Program, introduction of fare capping and
expansion of eligibility for RTD’s low-income fare discount program (LiVE).
The analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary
paratransit services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI
evaluation requirements. The introduction of expanded retail opportunities for the MyRide fare collection
system beyond the four RTD Sales Outlets is not included in this analysis as RTD is still in the process of
procuring retail expansion opportunities. The introduction of a substantially expanded set of retail
opportunities would require a future Title VI review.

Packet Pg. 239

17.E

Lastly, this analysis does not include the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. Per the FTA, promotional
fare reductions or pilots are excluded from being subject to a fare equity analysis if the pilot does not
last longer than six months. On June 22, 2023, FTA officials approved RTD’s request to extend the pilot
beyond the six-month period permitted under current federal regulation to a 12-month period, through
the end of the 2023-2024 school year and concluding August 31, 2024. If Zero Fare for Youth is sought
to be made permanent beyond the pilot period, a fare equity analysis is required to be completed prior to
the permanent fare change and will need Board approval.
Methodology:
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated
from passenger surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately
more likely to use the mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the
fare change.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
i.
Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
ii.
Review fares before the change and after the change;
iii.
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
iv.
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users.
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a
determination is made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit the overall population, including
non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Summary of Findings:
• Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both groups
experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat more
than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However, the fare changes do
not represent a disparate impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%
threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a disparate impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both
groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit
somewhat more than low-income customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However,
the fare changes do not represent a disproportionate burden on low-income customers as the
percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes

Packet Pg. 240

17.E

does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a
disproportionate burden.
Conclusions:
The average fare analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies. While changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for
some populations, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers
and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The
proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser
degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits does not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As
such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes
based on the average fare analysis.
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI fare
equity analysis, RTD has integrated equity focused improvements and targeted programs benefitting
minority and low-income populations as part of the draft recommendation. This includes LiVE expansion,
Transit Assistance Grant program, Semester Pass opt-in program for post-secondary educational
institutions and the zero fare for youth pilot. Additionally, RTD has planned efforts to expand access to
MyRide retail opportunities as well as increase outreach activities to promote the LiVE Program through
partnerships with community-based organizations.
Final Public Outreach and Engagement Efforts
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter III.5-6, RTD must promote inclusive public participation,
provide meaningful access to limited English proficient persons, and perform appropriate methods to
facilitate the public comment and community engagement process. The final public engagement
activities and public hearings comport with the federal guidelines and are illustrated in Section 7 of the
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
This analysis of the fare changes proposed as part the recent Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis that
includes a fare restructuring and price reduction, introduction of fare capping and expansion of eligibility for RTD’s
low-income fare discount program (“LiVE”) was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV
and Appendix K of FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare changes
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

In 2021, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) initiated the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (the
study) in response to feedback from customers and stakeholders that RTD fares are expensive and difficult to
understand. To address those issues, RTD launched the study to examine its fares holistically, taking into
consideration the three study goals of equity, affordability and simplicity. These goals have provided direction for
the overall study, guided the development and evaluation of alternatives and will be used to determine success.
RTD has taken a customer-centric approach to the study, with opportunities for customers as well as stakeholders
and community members to help shape the direction of the study. The study has included three distinct phases
of engagement to gather customer and community input and share updates on progress. The first phase, held in
spring 2022, was undertaken to identify challenges with the current fare system and to receive input on fare
structure preferences. The second phase, held in summer 2022, provided an overview of the customer and
stakeholder feedback heard during the first phase, as well as the conceptual fare options that were under
consideration and in the process for evaluating them. Phase 3 was conducted in fall 2022 to receive feedback on
the two fare structure alternatives that were developed and being considered. Final public engagement and public
hearings will be held between April 2023 and June 2023.
All of the engagement phases included customer and community meetings, three feedback panels aimed at larger
groups of constituents, focus groups with community-based organizations and a number of other methods of
providing feedback including two online surveys, a study website and social media posts. To ensure a communitydriven process, the study focused on Title VI and historically underrepresented populations. Partnerships were
formed with six community-based organizations to assist in reaching their respective clients, and included specific
focus groups with their clients.
The proposed alternative was developed based on feedback received on the two fare structure alternatives in the
third phase. The proposed fare changes include a number of structural and pricing changes to RTD’s fares, as well
as changes to current pass programs, new pass programs and technological changes to fare payment, including
the introduction of fare capping. The proposed alternative does not include changes that were implemented prior
to July 2022 and examined under a separate Fare Equity Analysis. Tables 1-4 summarize the proposed fare
changes, which include fare structure and pricing changes, LiVE Program changes, pass program changes, and
implementation of a Transit Assistance Grant Program and a College Semester Pass. More information about the
proposed fare changes is found in Section 6.

Elimination

● Lowered 3-Hour, Day Pass and Monthly Pass pricing.

● Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional fare
category. Customers would pay a flat fare for all travel
except for trips originating or ending at Denver
International Airport.

● Introduction of daily (service day) and monthly
(calendar) fare capping for full fare customers, seniors,
individuals with disabilities, LiVE customers and youth
using MyRide stored value with MyRide Barcode in the
MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card.
● Lowered Monthly Pass price, with the breakeven
multiple for the full fare Monthly Pass reduced from 38
times the price of a 3-Hour Pass to 32 times the price
of a 3-Hour Pass, resulting in an $88.00 Monthly Pass
and monthly fare cap.
● One Monthly Pass price for customers paying
discounted fares with an increased discount on the

breakeven multiple for Monthly Pass and monthly fare
cap for seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients and LiVE customers to 20 times the 3-Hour
Pass price ($27.00).

● For customers paying discounted fares, a single price

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:

It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 1 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.

July 11, 2023

RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).
Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

4 Fare Equity Analysis Methodology

The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected.2 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 3
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority
or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Throughout the document, the following definitions are used:
●
●

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). 2021 ticket sales data were used to
determine electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers in order to assess the impacts of the
introduction of fare capping on the average fare for overall, minority and low-income customers. 2017 CSS
demographic data combined with 2021 ticket sales data were used to estimate the potential increase in LiVE
ridership due to the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the
2019 CSS sample size was smaller than the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption,
which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes, introduction of fare capping and the income eligibility expansion
for the LiVE Program to include household income up to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Average Fare
Analysis does not assume any ridership changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure
of rider sensitivity to changes in fare rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions
are essential to modeling anticipated ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but is often
excluded from fare equity analyses. Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a
segment of customers prior to a fare change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in
average fare. This calculation becomes unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract
new customers to the system or from other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to
compare the average fare impacts of the fare changes on the same segment of customers after the change in
pricing and policies.
The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any increase in electronic MyRide fare adoption as RTD continues to
explore expanded retail opportunities for its electronic MyRide fare collection system at the time of the
preparation of this report. Introduction of expanded retail opportunities for MyRide beyond the four RTD Sales
Outlets that are currently open will improve access for unbanked and underbanked customers to load cash to
their accounts. Based on the 2019 CSS data, non-minority and non-low-income customers disproportionately use
electronic fare media (MyRide stored value and RTD Mobile Tickets App at the time of the 2019 CSS) at a higher
rate compared to minority and low-income customers. If RTD were to introduce a set of expanded MyRide retail
opportunities to increase access for customers to load cash to their accounts, MyRide adoption is presumed to
increase for minority and low-income customers. Because the Average Fare Analysis is based on 2019 CSS data
and does not assume any increase in electronic MyRide fare adoption, the Average Fare Analysis may understate

the benefits of fare capping for minority and low-income customers as it assumes that overall customers will
disproportionately benefit from fare capping compared to minority and low-income customers.

For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys.
In addition to the 2019 CSS, the 2020 LiVE Program Survey was used for demographics for LiVE customers. RTD
launched its LiVE Program in July 2019, after the 2019 CSS was conducted. Unlike the 2019 CSS that was conducted
onboard vehicles, the 2020 LiVE Program Survey was conducted via email and US mail. RTD invited the 6,579
customers whose applications were approved within the 12 months leading up to the survey to participate. After
removing duplicates, 886 surveys were included in the final LiVE Program Survey data set.
RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger sample of
completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic fare
adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched –
MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers. Evidence from a
number of transit agencies across the US suggest that the share of minority and low-income customers has
increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While RTD has no current survey data to indicate whether that is
true in the RTD service area, if one assumes it to be true then this current Fare Equity Analysis (with an assumed
lower share of minority and low-income customers) would show less beneficial differences in average fare
between minority and low-income customers and the system overall. Alternatively stated, if minority and lowincome ridership has increased, the difference in the impacts of the proposed fare changes between the overall
customer population and minority and low-income customers would decrease. This is because in determining the
impacts on the overall customer population, the weight of the impacts on minority and low-income customers
would increase, while the weight of the impacts on non-minority and non-low-income customers would decrease.
Additionally, there have been concerns about the potential movement of low-income and minority households
into outer regions of the RTD service area and their reliance on RTD services that require the Regional fare. While
there is no recent RTD-specific survey data suggesting this has occurred, if future survey data were to confirm this
trend, the current Average Fare Analysis using the 2019 CSS provides a conservative estimate of the benefits of
the proposed removal of the Regional fare for longer distance trips. The estimate of benefits may be conservative
because the Average Fare Analysis in this Fare Equity Analysis understates the benefits for minority and lowincome customers who were less likely to pay the Regional fare at the time of the 2019 CSS.

The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.

limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, since 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

A number of assumptions were also made in the Average Fare Analysis regarding:
●

Impact of fare capping on customers and electronic MyRide fare adoption

●

Participation of full fare customers in the LiVE Program with the income eligibility expansion

●

The Average Fare Analysis assumes the 3-Hour and Day Pass customers using electronic fares will benefit with the
introduction of fare capping, reducing the average fare paid by these customers in addition to the reduction due
to the proposed fare pricing decreases. The Average Fare Analysis assumes that non-minority and non-low-income
customers disproportionately benefit from the introduction of fare capping given their higher adoption of
electronic fare media based on the 2019 CSS.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Introduction of fare capping for customers paying fares using MyRide stored value results in a reduction in the
average fare paid by customers, in particular 3-Hour and Day Pass customers. Instead of purchasing a Day or
Monthly Pass upfront, fares paid by customers accrue towards daily and monthly fare caps, ensuring customers
always pay the best fare. For 3-Hour and Day Pass customers, the cost savings is anticipated to be notable,
especially with the reduction in the full fare Monthly Pass multiple from 38 to 32 times the 3-Hour Pass price. For
Monthly Pass customers, the cost savings is anticipated to be minimal as most Monthly Pass customers are making
more than 38 trips per month and others who purchase the Monthly Pass for convenience are making more than
32 trips per month. The cost savings anticipated for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers using electronic fare media
are incorporated into the average fares for the proposed fare structure. The reduction in the average fare is based
on 2017 CSS data that provide the distribution of 3-Hour and Day Pass respondents by the number of trips taken.
2017 CSS was used because it provided a larger data set than the 2019 CSS as well as the data needed on the
number of trips taken in the last week.
For determining the number of boardings that would potentially benefit from fare capping, the Average Fare
Analysis uses 2021 ticket sales data to determine electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers.
Electronic fare adoption is determined by calculating the proportion of tickets sold through the MyRide App
(formerly branded the RTD Mobile Tickets App) and MyRide stored value compared to total purchases, including
purchases at bus fareboxes or rail ticket vending machines. The Average Fare Analysis assumes electronic fare
adoption varies by rider category, fare level and fare payment type. While 3-Hour and Day Pass customers will
continue to be able to purchase 3-Hour and Day Pass mobile tickets rather than using stored value, the Average
Fare Analysis assumes that 100% of electronic fare customers would use MyRide stored value and thus benefit
from fare capping.
For LiVE customers, including those eligible as a result of the income eligibility expansion, the Average Fare
Analysis assumes 100% electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass as these customers must pay fares
using electronic fare media.
The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any adjustment to the average fare paid for 10-Ride Ticket customers
due to the introduction of fare capping. In 2021, less than 2% of 10-Ride Ticket Books were sold through the
MyRide App.
LiVE participation is expected to increase slightly with the expansion of the LiVE Program household income
eligibility limit from 185% to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Average Fare Analysis assumes that these
“expanded LiVE” customers would go from paying the full fare under the current fare structure to paying the LiVE
fare under the proposed fare structure. Given the slightly higher transfer and usage rates for LiVE customers
compared to full fare customers, the average fare for these customers is based on the same transfer and usage
rates as LiVE customers. The increased participation is based on the estimated current LiVE Program participation
rate among income eligible customers and the number of boardings made by full fare customers who would
become income eligible for the LiVE Program as part of the income eligibility expansion. The current LiVE Program

The benefits of fare capping are accrued only by customers paying stored value using a MyRide Barcode in the
MyRide App or MyRide Smart Card. While customers with credit and debit cards are able to load value online or
through the MyRide App and Website, cash customers can only load value at the four RTD Sales Outlets that are
currently open across the region. There is no MyRide retail network at the time of the preparation of this report.
Given the limitations to loading cash to a MyRide account, there is no basis for assuming increased electronic fare
adoption.

Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) and CollegePass contract pricing is based on prior ridership data
and the applicable fare. Given that pricing is based on prior ridership, 2021 contract pricing was based on preCOVID ridership, resulting in a temporarily higher average fare. To reflect the average fare per boarding in the
future as ridership stabilizes, the Average Fare Analysis uses the average fare that would have been collected
based on 2021 ridership data and the applicable fare under the current fare structure and proposed fare structure.
For CollegePass, the total number of boardings is understated. For Auraria Higher Education, RTD introduced an
option to use the MyRide App for CollegePass students. Ridership data for these students using the app is not
available and thus is excluded from the Average Fare Analysis. Further, Auraria Higher Education offered its
CollegePass as an opt-in pass. If Auraria Higher Education returns to an all-in model that provides a CollegePass to
all eligible students, ridership is anticipated to increase.
The Average Fare Analysis assumes the introduction of two new fare payment types: LiVE Monthly Pass (as well
as a monthly fare cap) and Semester Pass. These new fare payment types will likely disproportionately benefit
low-income and minority customers. As such, the assumptions for adoption of these products are constrained in
the Average Fare Analysis so as to not overstate the benefits of the new fare payment types, and are described
further below.
For current LiVE customers, the Average Fare Analysis incorporates the benefits of introducing a LiVE Monthly
Pass to the fare capping assumptions for LiVE 3-Hour and Day Pass customers. For new LiVE customers that
become eligible for LiVE as part of the income eligibility expansion, the Average Fare Analysis incorporates
separate line items for the Monthly Pass as these newly eligible LIVE customers are assumed to transition from
purchasing a full fare Monthly Pass to purchasing a LiVE Monthly Pass. While introducing a LiVE Monthly Pass may
increase interest in the LiVE Program, no increase in LiVE participation is assumed in order to not overstate the
benefits of introducing a LiVE Monthly Pass for low-income and minority customers.
For Semester Pass, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that 1% of full fare Local Monthly Pass customers would
transition to purchasing a Semester Pass. This is based on the share of Monthly Pass customers who indicated
“to/from school/college” as the primary purpose of the trip taken on the 2019 CSS. The analysis was careful to
exclude CollegePass and youth respondents when making the 1% calculation. The Average Fare Analysis does not
assume any transition of full fare Regional Monthly Pass customers to Semester Pass as there were no Regional
Monthly Pass respondents indicating “to/from school/college” as the primary purpose of the trip taken.
While the proposed changes include the introduction of a Transit Assistance Grant Program, the potential
implications of that program are not included in the Average Fare Analysis. The Grant Program is not included
because it is intended to generate new ridership, and grant recipients are to distribute the 10-Ride Ticket Books
at no cost to their clients. Further the tickets distributed through the program are not intended to supplant current
fare purchases by grant recipients.
Within the baseline model, reflecting RTD’s existing fare structure, there is no Airport Monthly Pass. Instead,
customers may use their Regional Monthly Pass for trips that require the Airport fare and the Airport boardings
associated with the use of the Regional Monthly Pass for trips to/from Denver International Airport are included
with the Regional Monthly Pass in the Average Fare Analysis. When evaluating the proposed alternative, the

For the Bulk Purchase Program, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that all purchases by nonprofit organizations
in 2021 would transition to the program as well as 10% off full fare Monthly Passes. Prior to the discontinuation
of the FlexPass Program (a prior RTD program similar to the Bulk Purchase Program proposal), approximately 10%
of full fare Monthly Passes were purchased through the program. The FlexPass Program provided a discount on
Monthly Pass purchases based on the number of passes purchased, whether the employer provided a matching
discount to employees and whether the employer offered the FlexPass on a pre-tax basis.
Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

5 System Ridership Demographics Overview
The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

African-American/Black
Asian/Pacific Islander
Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin
Hispanic/Latino

5.2 Income Assumptions

Table 5 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 6 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.
Figure 1: Ridership Ethnicity

Figure 2: Ridership Income

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded
to ethnicity- and income-related questions to develop a breakdown of demographics by fare payment type.
Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 7 presents the fare
payment type by minority and income status.

6 Fare Change Proposal
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project launched in 2022 after customer feedback indicated
that fares are too expensive and difficult to understand. The proposed fare changes include a number of
structural and pricing changes to RTD’s fares, as well as changes to current pass programs, introduction of new
pass programs and technological changes to fare payment, including the introduction of fare capping facilitated
by RTD’s new MyRide fare collection system and described in Section 6.2. The three study goals, (1) equity, (2)
affordability, and (3) simplicity, as well as customer, community and stakeholder input throughout the study led
to the proposed fare changes summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
Proposed fare changes to be implemented in 2024 include changes to fare pricing, fare structure, pass programs
and the LiVE Program, referenced below.

6.1.1 Fare Structure
●

Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional fare category

●

For customers paying discounted fares, a single price fare level for all travel, including trips originating or
ending at Denver International Airport

RTD’s fare structure comprises three fare levels: Local, Regional and Airport. For rail trips, customers pay a Local
or Regional fare based on the number of zones they travel through while fixed-route bus customers pay a Local
or Regional fare based on the type of service and distance traveled. For FlexRide trips, customers pay the Local
fare. The Airport fare applies to any rail travel in the Airport zone and for most bus service to/from Denver
International Airport.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Under the proposed fare changes, full fare customers will pay a flat fare for all travel except for select trips
originating or ending at Denver International Airport. Customers who begin or end their trip or who transfer at
Denver International Airport will pay the Airport fare on select services. Customers who do not travel to Denver

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

International Airport but use fixed-route bus services with the Airport fare will continue to be able to downgrade
the fare to pay the Local fare (e.g., SkyRide routes).

Customers paying discounted fares, including seniors, individuals with disabilities, LiVE customers and youth, will
pay a single price and will not be subject to the Airport fare. This will provide these customers with access
throughout the region for a single price.
Currently, customers who use a Local pass for a Regional or Airport trip or a Regional pass for an Airport trip must
pay an upgrade. The proposed fare changes flatten the fare structure by removing the Regional fare level for all
customers and the Regional and Airport fare level for customers paying discounted fares. These changes eliminate
the need for unique Regional fare products. Further, customers paying discounted fares will no longer need to pay
an upgrade for any travel. Upgrades will only be required for full fare Local 3-Hour and Day Pass customers making
trips requiring the Airport fare.

6.1.2 Fare Discounts
●

Increased LiVE discount from 40% to 50% on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass

●

Increased discount on the Monthly Pass for customers paying discounted fares to 70%, establishing one
Monthly Pass price for customers paying discounted fares

●

No change to 50% discount on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass for seniors, individuals with disabilities and/or
Medicare recipients

●

No change to 70% discount on 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes for youth aged 19 and younger

Seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients will continue to receive a 50% discount on full fare 3Hour Pass and Day Pass, equating to a $1.35 3-Hour Pass and a $2.70 Day Pass. RTD proposes to increase the LiVE
discount from 40% to 50% of the full fare Local 3-Hour and Day Pass. This aligns the LiVE discount/pricing with the
discount for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients resulting in one, unified discounted fare
level.
If the Zero Fare for Youth pilot is not implemented, or if Zero Fare for Youth is not made permanent after the pilot
period, youth will continue to receive a 70% discount on full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes.
The discount on the Monthly Pass for all customers paying a discounted fare will increase to 70%, establishing one
discounted price of $27.00.
For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.

6.1.3 Fare Capping
●

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

Routes 104L, 169L and 145X serving Denver International Airport will not be subject to the Airport fare. Routes
104L and 169L do not currently charge the Airport fare for trips originating or ending at Denver International
Airport. Route 145X does currently charge the Airport fare, but will not be subject to the Airport fare for trips
originating or ending at Denver International Airport under this proposal.

Introduction of daily (service day) and monthly (calendar) fare capping for customers using MyRide
stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card

Packet Pg. 282

17.E.b
July 11, 2023

RTD’s new MyRide fare collection system enables RTD to introduce fare capping, which offers customers the best
fare based on their trip-making behavior. Unlike Monthly Passes, customers do not need to purchase a Monthly
Pass upfront. With fare capping, customers can pay as they go and have their fares capped on a daily or monthly
basis such that they do not exceed the price of a comparable Day Pass or Monthly Pass. This removes financial
barriers for customers who may not be able to pay for a Monthly Pass upfront and also increases convenience for
customers by providing them the best fare without needing to determine whether to purchase a pass upfront.
Customers using stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card will be able
to take advantage of fare capping.
All fares paid with MyRide stored value will apply towards the daily and monthly fare caps. For full fare customers
traveling to/from Denver International Airport, Airport fares and upgrades may apply until the customer pays the
equivalent of the price of the Airport Day Pass or Monthly Pass.
While under the proposed fare structure, all Monthly Pass customers will be able to travel to/from Denver
International Airport without paying an Airport upgrade, full fare customers using fare capping will be paying on
a trip-by-trip basis towards the daily and monthly fare caps. These customers will pay the Airport fare or upgrade
until they reach the Airport daily fare cap or monthly fare cap.

6.1.4 Fare Pricing
●

Lowered Local and Airport fares

●

Lowered Monthly Pass multiple to reflect hybrid work schedules and provide greater affordability for
transit-reliant customers

●

Eliminated the discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books for full fare customers, seniors, individuals with
disabilities and Medicare recipients

The Airport fare will remain, but the fare will be lowered from $10.50 to $10.00 for a full fare 3-Hour Pass/Day
Pass. The Local fare will also be lowered from $3.00 to $2.75 for a full fare 3-Hour Pass and from $6.00 to $5.50
for a full fare Day Pass. Lower full fare Local fares will result in lower fares for customers paying discounted fares.
The discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books will be eliminated for full fare customers, seniors, individuals with disabilities
and Medicare recipients. LiVE and youth 10-Ride Ticket Books do not currently include a discount. 10-Ride Ticket
Books will be priced at 10 times the price of the applicable 3-Hour Pass. More information about the availability
of 10-Ride Ticket Books is presented in Section 6.2.
RTD will decrease the full fare Monthly Pass multiple from 38 to 32 times the price of the full fare 3-Hour Pass,
resulting in an $88 Monthly Pass and monthly fare cap for full fare customers. One Monthly Pass price will be
established for customers paying discounted fares. This Monthly Pass will be discounted approximately 70%,
equating to a Monthly Pass multiple of 31.8 for youth, and a Monthly Pass multiple of 20.0 for seniors, individuals
with disabilities, Medicare recipients and LiVE customers.
For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

While paratransit fare changes are not analyzed in this Fare Equity Analysis, RTD will be changing its Access-a-Ride
fares. The Local Access-a-Ride fare will change from $5.00 to $4.50, and the Airport Access-a-Ride fare will change
from $20.00 to $19.00. The Regional Access-a-Ride will be discontinued. Customers can pay their Access-a-Ride
fare in cash on-vehicle or with a mobile ticket. Local paper 6-Ride Ticket Books will continue to be available and

July 11, 2023

priced at six times the Local Access-a-Ride fare. As part of the proposed fare changes, RTD will also allow eligible
customers to apply a 50% LiVE discount to Access-a-Ride fares.

●

Expanded LiVE eligibility requirements to encourage LiVE participation

●

Introduction of a LiVE paper and mobile Monthly Passes and MyRide monthly fare capping

●

Increased discounts for customers using LiVE fares

●

Travel anywhere in the service area for a single price fare level (no Regional and Airport fare)

The proposed fare changes include expanding access to the LiVE low-income fare program. The income eligibility
threshold will increase from 185% to 250% of the federal poverty level, and customers applying to the LiVE
Program will no longer need an address within RTD’s service district, which will require a change to the Colorado
state PEAK system used for eligibility verification.
RTD will introduce LiVE paper and mobile Monthly Passes as well as monthly fare capping for LiVE customers using
MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or new MyRide Smart Card. Introduction of the new LiVE Monthly Pass will
improve access to LiVE fares. The Monthly Passes and monthly fare capping will also increase the affordability of
transit for LiVE customers by capping the amount spent on transit for these customers on a calendar month basis.
As noted above in Section 6.1.2, the discount for LiVE customers will increase to 50% on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass
and 70% on Monthly Passes, aligning them with seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients. The
price of 3-Hour and Day Pass for LiVE customers will align with those for seniors, individuals with disabilities and
Medicare recipients. There would be no change to how LiVE customers would purchase 3-Hour Passes and Day
Passes. RTD continues to increase opportunities for LiVE customers to access fare products. As discussed earlier,
RTD is planning on introducing a paper and mobile LiVE Monthly Pass. RTD is also exploring expanded
opportunities to purchase fares using cash at retail locations. At a future point in time, if the provision of LiVE
Monthly Passes and expanded retail opportunities to facilitate cash purchases is still determined to be insufficient
to meet the needs of LiVE customers, RTD may consider other cash payment opportunities. Section 6.1.8 provides
additional detail on expanded retail opportunities, and Table 9 in Section 6.3 identifies the current and proposed
fare distribution by fare payment type and rider category.
Also as noted above in Section 6.1.1, the Regional fare will be removed and the remaining Airport fare will not
apply for LiVE customers under the new fare structure.
Also, while paratransit fare changes are not analyzed in this Fare Equity Analysis, RTD will allow customers to apply
a 50% LiVE discount to Access-a-Ride fares.

6.1.6 Other Programs
●

Establishment of a Transit Assistance Grant Program to assist organizations that serve individuals with
immediate transit needs

●

Introduction of a discount for bulk purchases through a Bulk Purchase Program

●

Introduction of a Semester Pass Program to provide an opt-in pass alternative to the CollegePass
program for smaller colleges and community colleges

17.E.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

RTD proposes to introduce a Transit Assistance Grant Program to help organizations serving clients with
immediate transit needs. RTD will initially distribute up to $1 million of full fare paper 10-Ride Ticket Books per
calendar year at no cost to grant recipients. The grant recipients must distribute the tickets to their clients or
constituents for free. RTD will release one annual call for grant proposals and a grant program selection panel,
consisting of internal RTD staff and external stakeholders, will determine grant recipients based on clear and
transparent evaluation criteria, such as an organization’s IRS Tax Exempt Letter and whether they serve
populations with immediate transit needs. The RTD in consultation with the grant program selection panel will
determine evaluation criteria, the scope of reporting requirements and participant responsibilities. RTD is
budgeting internal funding for the Transit Assistance Grant Program; however, in the future, RTD may seek
supplemental funding from external partners.
Bulk Purchase Program
The proposed Bulk Purchase Program will introduce a 10% discount on bulk purchases with an invoice amount of
$1,500 or more. RTD currently allows organizations and employers to purchase fare products in bulk, but does not
provide a discount on bulk purchases. Contracts are currently required for recurring bulk paper purchases or any
mobile bulk purchases. Customers will be able to purchase all fare products available to the public through the
Bulk Purchase Program except stored value, and current contract rules are likely to remain. The discount does not
apply to EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass contracts. If the ability to purchase stored value for
individuals in bulk becomes available in the future, the bulk discount would not apply to stored value loads.
While any individual or organization can purchase fare products through the Bulk Purchase Program, RTD will
manage payments differently based on organization and sale type. For nonprofit and community based
organizations, online orders, and one-time orders, customers will prepay. Customers with unused paper fare
products are not eligible for refunds, but nonprofit and community based organizations may be eligible to
exchange expired, unused paper 10-Ride Ticket Books. Customers purchasing bulk mobile passes will pay for the
passes that are activated and used, with the discount calculated once utilization is determined and if the invoice
amount is $1,500 or more.
While employers or organizations purchasing fare products via the Bulk Purchase Program may pass on the cost
of the pass to employees or clients, the amount collected cannot exceed the amount paid for the pass.
Semester Pass
In response to community feedback about alternatives to CollegePass, RTD proposes to establish a Semester Pass
Program for post-secondary educational institutions, targeted towards smaller colleges and community colleges.
The program will be open to post-secondary educational institutions not enrolled in CollegePass. Participating
institutions will offer the Semester Pass to enrolled part-time or full-time students, and institutions can pass
through the entire cost of the pass or subsidize all or part of the cost for students. Students purchasing a Semester
Pass will be able purchase the pass on an opt-in basis from the participating institution. Participating institutions
that subsidize the Semester Pass may also opt to subsidize the pass for all or a subset of students.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

Transit Assistance Grant Program

The Semester Pass will be valid for a term duration set by the institution. The pricing will total approximately 80%
of a full fare Monthly Pass per month of the valid term. Students will be able to use the Semester Pass on all fixedroute and FlexRide services, including travel to/from Denver International Airport.

Students eligible for LiVE fares, students with disabilities or youth may opt not to participate in the Semester Pass
program, as discounted fares will provide lower fare prices.
RTD will collect the fare revenue from the participating institution based on the passes issued. The institutions will
be responsible for collecting fees and distributing the passes to their students.

●

Simplified EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass programs

Business EcoPass
RTD’s Business EcoPass is an employer-sponsored pass that provides eligible employees at participating employers
unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. The program is based on a calendar year and is an all-in,
insurance-based model, which means employers must purchase passes for every eligible employee. Employers
can decide to completely subsidize the price of the pass, or pass all or part of the costs on to the employee, who
can pay for it with pre-tax dollars. Business EcoPass pricing is based on three factors: number of employees, a
business’s location in the RTD service area (referred to as Service Level Areas (SLAs)) and actual ridership two
years in arrears (referred to as utilization-based pricing). For large employers with over 3,000 employees,
employer-specific ridership data is used for pricing. For new large employers, SLA pricing is used until employer
specific ridership data is available for contract pricing. RTD manages the program via annual contracts with
employers. Independent of the policy changes proposed in the Fare Study, RTD will eliminate photos on Business
EcoPass MyRide Smart Cards.
There are several proposed changes to the Business EcoPass program.
●

RTD will introduce fixed pricing for 2-year intervals starting in 2024 and 2025. Currently, pricing is updated
annually. Pricing in 2-year intervals will apply to employers subject to SLA pricing, and large employers.

●

RTD will consolidate SLA A (suburban) and SLA B (major transit centers), and consolidate all employer size
categories (currently four) to a single size category. This will reduce the total number of pricing zones
across the region from 16 to three.

●

The contract minimums will be reduced from $1,368/year for SLAs A and B, and $2,400/year for SLAs C
and D to a single contract minimum of $950/year for all SLAs. This is equal to the purchase of 12 Monthly
Passes at the Bulk Purchase Program price.

●

All trips taken by Business EcoPass participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare rate, and the
Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. Currently, the Business EcoPass
pricing applies the applicable fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) for each trip taken when determining
utilization pricing. As the Local Monthly Pass will now be valid for all travel, including to/from Denver
International Airport, without an Airport upgrade, the Business EcoPass will also entitle the passholder to
travel to/from Denver International Airport.

●

Participants will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
employees participating in EcoPass received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

6.1.7 Pass Program

Although fare capping will be available to the general public, fare capping will not apply to Business EcoPass
utilization pricing. Similarly, RTD will not provision entitlements onto eligible Business EcoPass participants’

accounts, so discounted fares will not be factored into utilization pricing. Further, the discount offered through
the Bulk Purchase Program will not apply to Business EcoPass contracts.

Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) is a pass program providing residents of enrolled neighborhoods, apartment
buildings and/or homeowner associations unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. The NECO program
operates in a similar way to Business EcoPass and is based on an all-in, insurance-based model, which means
neighborhoods must purchase passes for all household residents, but pricing is slightly different. For new NECO
contracts, pricing is initially based on a fixed price per household. Once neighborhood specific data is available,
pricing is based on utilization ridership data for the neighborhood. Unlike Business EcoPass, RTD incorporated fare
discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities in determining NECO pricing. While historically NECO
participants have been provided with a NECO MyRide smart card with their photo on it, policy changes
independent of the Fare Study will mean that future NECO MyRide Smart Cards will not have photos.
There are several proposed changes to the NECO program.
●

Similar to Business EcoPass, all trips taken by NECO participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare
rate, and the Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. Further, no fare
discounts will be applied for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities for contract pricing.

●

RTD will make permanent the temporary reduction of the NECO contract minimum from $7,000 to $4,000.
Prior to COVID, the contract minimum for a neighborhood was $7,000. During COVID, due to decreases in
transit ridership, the contract minimum was temporarily reduced to $4,000.

●

RTD will reduce new neighborhood pricing from $175 per household per year to $125 per household.

●

Participants will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
residents participating in NECO received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

●

Since utilization pricing will not take into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with
disabilities, NECO neighborhood coordinators will not need to provide information on whether a
participant would qualify for a fare discount, simplifying their roles and responsibilities. Further, RTD will
not add entitlements onto eligible NECO participants’ accounts.

In alignment with Business EcoPass, fare capping will not apply to NECO pricing.
CollegePass
CollegePass is a pass program offered to post-secondary educational institutions. Students enrolled in CollegePass
can take unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. RTD maintains annual contracts with colleges and
universities based on the all-in, insurance-based model with institution-specific utilization pricing. As an all-in
program, institutions are required to enroll all eligible students into CollegePass. CollegePass is not an opt-in pass
program for students (see proposed Semester Pass for opt-in program for post-secondary educational
institutions). For new CollegePass contracts, pricing is initially based on a fixed price per student until institutionspecific ridership data is available for contract pricing. Colleges and universities can decide to completely subsidize
the price of the pass, or pass all or part of the costs to students. While historically CollegePass students have been
provided with a MyRide smart card with their photo on it, policy changes independent of the Fare Study will mean
that future CollegePass MyRide Smart Cards will not have photos.

●

Similar to EcoPass, all trips taken by CollegePass participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare rate,
and the Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. In alignment with Business
EcoPass and NECO, RTD will not count discounted fares toward utilization pricing for CollegePass.

●

RTD will reduce the pricing for new colleges/universities from approximately $26 per student per month
to $15 per student per month.

●

Contract minimums for participating colleges will decrease from $15,600 per academic year to $9,000 per
academic year.

●

Students will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
students participating in CollegePass received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

In alignment with Business EcoPass and NECO, fare capping will not apply to CollegePass pricing.

6.1.8 Additional Fare Guidance
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis identified additional fare changes and/or pilots. These
changes/pilots are not evaluated in this Fare Equity Analysis.
Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program
RTD is intending to proceed with a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program for a period of up to 18-months. The
proposed Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program is not included in this Fare Equity Analysis or in the Average Fare
Analysis, but should the pilot be made permanent or extend beyond 6-months without a waiver from FTA, a Title
VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required. The duration of the pilot would be up to 18-months with a start date
to be determined. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, would be eligible for participation in
the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot would likely be
supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding partners. A
permanent Zero Fare for Youth Program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable, external
funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70% discount
on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth Program is intended as a pilot with no established schedule for either
implementation or termination, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare Analysis assumes that the fare pricing
for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full fare before and after the pilot. For
details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.
LiVE Access Expansion
During customer, community and stakeholder outreach, RTD received feedback for the need to increase
awareness of the LiVE Program and work with community partners to better market and expand access to the
LiVE Program. RTD plans to develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan. RTD also plans to
explore expanding means testing beyond the current State of Colorado’s PEAK system, which is used to determine
eligibility for federal and state assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
and Colorado’s Medicaid program. Expanding means testing beyond the PEAK system and changes to eligibility

criteria not listed above in Section 6.1.5 are not included in this Fare Equity Analysis or in the Average Fare Analysis,
but should the criteria for eligibility change, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required.

The ability for customers to load cash into their MyRide accounts is critical for promoting equitable access and
adoption of the electronic MyRide fares. At the time of preparation of this report, cash customers can only load
value to their MyRide account at the four RTD Sales Outlets that are currently open in the region. Expansion of
MyRide retail opportunities beyond the four RTD Sales Outlets will improve access for unbanked and underbanked
customers to load cash to their accounts. While RTD plans to expand MyRide retail opportunities, RTD is still in
the process of procuring retail expansion opportunities and as such it is not included in this Fare Equity Analysis.
The introduction of a substantially expanded set of retail opportunities would require a future Title VI review.

6.2 Pricing, Payment and Media Changes
Table 8 summarizes the proposed fare pricing changes by fare payment type. Several fare changes aim to simplify
RTD’s fare structure and introduce more equitable and affordable fares for RTD customers.
Proposed fare media and product changes include introduction of fare capping, elimination of all Regional fare
products and acceptance of Local fare products on Regional services, elimination of mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books
and introduction of a LiVE Monthly Pass and fare cap.
●

RTD will introduce daily (service day) and monthly (calendar) fare capping for customers using MyRide
stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card, as noted in Section
6.1.3

●

RTD will eliminate mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books since discounts will no longer be provided on 10-Ride
Ticket Books as noted in Section 6.1.4 and customers will be able to purchase multiple mobile 3-Hour
Passes in the MyRide App in one transaction. Customers will continue to be able to purchase paper 10Ride Ticket Books via the RTD Online Store, RTD and Third Party Sales Outlets and the Bulk Purchase
Program. RTD will also distribute paper 10-Ride Ticket Books through the proposed Transit Assistance
Grant Program discussed in Section 6.1.6.

●

RTD will introduce a LiVE Monthly Pass and fare cap, which will align with the other discounted fare
Monthly Pass/cap, as noted in Section 6.1.5.

The fare payment types that are highlighted in light teal are newly available fare payment types (e.g., daily and
monthly fare capping), while the fare payment types that are highlighted in light gray are discontinued fare
payment types (e.g., mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books).

6.3 Media Distribution and Sales Outlets Changes
The proposed fare changes impact the fare payment types available through different sales channels.
Customers can currently purchase 10-Ride Ticket Books, Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books at four
RTD Sales Outlets: Civic Center Station, Union Station Bus Concourse, Downtown Boulder Station and Denver
Airport Station. A fifth location is temporarily closed (Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station). Third Party Sales
Outlets, which currently include King Soopers and Safeway stores, provide approximately 130 locations across the
metro area for customers to purchase 10-Ride Ticket Books, Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books.
Customers can purchase paper 10-Ride Ticket Books, paper Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books via
the RTD Online Store, and RTD sends the purchased fare products in the mail free of charge. These fare payment
types will remain available at the RTD Online Store but the Regional versions of these fare products will be
discontinued. Customers can currently purchase physical MyRide cards online through their MyRide account and
will receive them in the mail free of charge. Customers will continue to have a way to order new MyRide cards
online and receive them in the mail, via the RTD Online Store.
Customers can purchase mobile tickets and passes in the MyRide App or via the MyRide Website and use them in
their MyRide App. Similarly, customers can manage their MyRide account and load value to their account in the
MyRide App or via the MyRide Website. Cash as well as credit and debit card customers can load value to their
MyRide accounts at RTD Sales Outlets. Customers who want to purchase tickets using stored value must convert
the value loaded into their MyRide accounts to mobile tickets in the MyRide App or via the MyRide Website. With
the launch of the new MyRide fare collection system, in addition to using the MyRide App, MyRide Smart Card
customers can load value to their MyRide accounts and manage their accounts similar to MyRide App customers,
although MyRide Smart Card customers cannot purchase mobile tickets to use with their MyRide Smart Card.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Customers are no longer able to obtain or reload the new MyRide Smart Cards at select Safeway and King Soopers
stores, as they could previously. Customers will continue to be able to obtain and reload MyRide Smart Cards at
RTD Sales Outlets. In the future, RTD plans to expand MyRide retail opportunities for the new MyRide fare

7 Fare Proposal Outreach
The following is a summary of themes across the feedback received.

In the fourth and final phase of public engagement for the RTD Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis,
customers and community members had the opportunity to provide feedback on the recommended changes to
the fare structure, policies and programs through public comment. The public comment period was open from
April 13 to May 24, 2023.
Public comment could be submitted in several formats, including:




Online on the Fare Feedback website, which provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed fare
changes
Written on a paper comment form at Fare Study open houses, station pop-ups and community events
Spoken out loud at one of four virtual public hearings

The public comment form asked for open-ended feedback on three topics: the recommended fare structure,
recommended policies and programs and fare equity (Title VI Analysis). Participants could optionally include their
name, organization with which they were affiliated, and demographic information (including racial and ethnic
background, income, household size and age). A list of organizations represented and a summary of demographic
information of the commenters are included in this summary.
Table 11 provides a summary of the outreach events and methods along with the estimated number of
participants. Engagement opportunities and methods of promotion included:

7.2 Summary of Public Comments
Through comments directly related to the fare study, significant support was provided for the components of the
proposal. The following themes were present in the feedback:

Fare Structure
There was significant support for changes to the fare structure that would support the fare study’s goals of
simplicity, affordability and equity. In total, 731 comments were submitted from a variety of methods. Additional
comments unrelated to the fare structure study are not included.




Simplicity: Participants expressed support for the consolidation of the Local and Regional fare levels,
indicating this would provide much needed simplicity and benefit commuters who travel significant
distances.
Affordability: Many commenters expressed appreciation for the reduction in costs, particularly in an era
of increasing inflation. In particular:
o Commenters supported the decreased full fare monthly pass price ($88) and discount monthly
pass price ($27), explaining that this would benefit frequent riders, particularly airport employees
and regular DIA travelers with the inclusion of the Airport fare within the monthly pass.
o Many comments noted that the lower monthly pass price made transit more cost competitive
with driving and parking. Some previous customers indicated that the decrease in fares would
encourage them to begin using RTD services again; commenters believed that may result in
increased transit use/decrease car traffic and related environmental benefits.
o Nonprofit staff members said that the price decreases would support the needs of their clients
who may be transit-reliant or have limited financial resources.

17.E.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Equity: Commenters noted that transit-reliant equity populations would be well served by this
recommendation. They indicated that changes to the fare structure and discount programs would allow
individuals with disabilities, low-income customers, older adults, and community members who are
unhoused to attend appointments, travel to work or school, and make other necessary trips without
incurring significant cost burdens associated with transit. Others supported the incorporation of the LiVE
discount into Access-a-Ride fares.

There were also some suggestions for further improvements to the fare structure, many of which were considered
through the fare study process but found to be financially or operationally unfeasible.





Simplicity: Many commenters urged RTD to have a single fare for all destinations, including the airport.
Affordability: Many commenters urged RTD to further reduce prices or provide fare-free transit for all
customers. Some commenters indicated the Airport fare ($10) is still a financial burden and is not a costcompetitive option, especially for groups of individuals traveling together. Some also encouraged RTD to
offer higher discounts for customers using Discount programs and suggested that discounts for older
adults should start earlier to coincide with retirement.
Equity: A number of commenters encouraged RTD to consider fares rounded to the nearest (and lowest)
dollar to ensure customers using cash would not overpay for service – or to ensure drivers have change
to offer to customers in return for overpayment. RTD was also encouraged to provide additional outreach
for discount programs to ensure eligible customers were aware of their existence, with grocery stores,
food banks and libraries listed as locations to promote information and possibly offer retail options for
discount pass purchases. Additional feedback on how to more broadly approach RTD’s LiVE program is
outlined below.

Passes and Pass Programs
Commenters also provided support for current and proposed passes and programs.
Zero Fare for Youth
Overwhelming enthusiasm was shown for the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program, noting that this would:






Support youth in accessing school and work
Benefit families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who see
driving as a more affordable option
Meet climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provide youth with independence and agency
Support lifelong transit use

Comments also encouraged RTD to seek long-term funding sources, potentially through the State of Colorado, to
ensure the program lasts beyond the first year.
Additional Passes and Programs

Commenters viewed the transit assistance grant program as a benefit for non-profit organizations with limited
budgets who aim to support clients with travel needs to appointments, food banks, job interviews and others.
They also voiced support for the updates to the EcoPass program and its positive impact on commuting
employees.

RTD was also encouraged to consider other ways to decrease the cost of transit for commuting employees,
including those traveling to the airport.

Customers were encouraged to provide feedback on RTD’s outreach plan for the proposed LiVE income-based
fare discount program expansion as well as recommendations of organizations for RTD to partner with to increase
awareness of the LiVE program. These included nonprofit organizations, libraries, college and schools, heath care
facilities and stores among others.
When asked who RTD should partner with to spread the information about the LiVE program, participants
recommended partnering with nonprofits with Spanish speaking constituents, libraries, educational entities
including Denver Public Schools, and healthcare facilities, including those who serve the Spanish speaking
populations.

7.3 Changes to Proposal
In the fourth and final phase of the fare study and equity analysis, the public comments overall demonstrate public
support for the recommended fare structure, policies and programs. Additionally, no items of significant concern
were raised in public comments that suggest further review of the recommendation and its impacts on the
community is necessary. As such, no changes are proposed to the Systemwide Fare Study and Fare Equity Analysis
recommendations, and the final draft Title VI fare equity analysis will be presented to the RTD Board of Directors
for review and adoption.

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings

The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for some populations, the
aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers and between all customers and
low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit
minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits
do not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.
This Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare Analysis did not evaluate a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program, LiVE
access expansion beyond proposed changes in Section 6.1.5 or the expansion of a MyRide retail opportunities for
cash customers. These items are discussed in Section 6.1.8. A separate Fare Equity Analysis may be required as
RTD moves forward with the implementation of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program or the expansion of MyRide
retail opportunities, depending on the proposed changes. Nonetheless, these changes would likely benefit
minority and low-income customers. As such, the Average Fare Analysis represented in this document likely
understates potential upcoming benefits for minority and low-income customers.
It should also be noted that the introduction of the Transit Assistance Grant Program is not included in the Average
Fare Analysis as the program is intended to generate new ridership, and grant recipients are to distribute the
tickets at no cost to their clients.

8.1 Average Fare by Fare Level and Fare Payment Type
Overall, customers will experience a decrease in the average fare paid per boarding. As shown in Table 12, the
systemwide average fare for all customers would decrease from $1.41 to $1.05 (25.4% decrease). The reduction
in average fare varies dramatically by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

Customers paying the Regional fare experience significantly greater reductions in the average fare compared to
customers paying the Local fare (Regional average fare decreases by $1.31, while Local average fare decreases by
$0.17, for a difference of $1.14). This is due to charging the Local fare for trips that previously required paying the
Regional fare. Customers paying the Airport fare also experience greater reductions in the average fare compared
to customers paying the Local fare. This is primarily due to the introduction of fare capping and the reduction in
the Monthly Pass price resulting from reducing the Monthly Pass multiple and including travel to/from the Denver

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Local Neighborhood EcoPass is the one specific fare payment type that experiences an increase in the average
fare; however, in aggregate, the NECO program experiences a 22% decrease in average fare when factoring in
Airport and Regional trips. The average fare for NECO customers making a trip that requires the Local fare
increases as a result of no longer taking into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with
disabilities in contract pricing. However, NECO contracts are priced based on total ridership, and overall, the NECO
program experiences a decrease in the average fare due to the discontinuation of applying the Regional and
Airport fare to determine contract pricing (proposed fare change would price all trips at the Local, full fare for pass
program pricing).

8.2 Average Fare Analysis Results
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, but
does note that minority and low-income customers do not benefit as much as the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers do not benefit as much as the overall population in the Average
Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by fare level. Minority
and low-income customers rely much more heavily on Local fare level trips compared to all customers, as noted
in Table 14. While the Average Fare Analysis findings suggest that minority and low-income customers do not
benefit as much as the overall customer population due to the significant decreases in Regional and Airport fares,
the proposed fare changes may actually lower financial barriers and improve mobility and access for these
customer populations. By removing the Regional fare level and providing a lower priced Monthly Pass that is valid
for travel anywhere in the RTD service area, the fare structure may allow customers to travel to parts of the region
that they previously chose not to visit or may have been unable to due to the price of Regional and Airport fares.
The Average Fare Analysis analyzes impacts on customers based on current travel behavior and does not attempt
to forecast how proposed changes may alter future travel behavior or improve customer access.

overview of the findings resulting from the change, including the Average Fare per Boarding, Absolute Change and
Percentage Change are presented in Table 15 with the following description:
●

Changes that represent a greater percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., more beneficial
for minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in green.

●

Changes that are within 1% are considered to have similar impact and are not highlighted.

As noted in Section 4, the data and methodology used were developed to not overstate the potential benefits of
the proposed fare changes for minority and low-income customers. An increase in the proportion of customers
who are minority and/or low-income systemwide or among customers paying Regional fare as the result of the
COVID impacts on ridership demographics, suburbanization of poverty or reduction of financial barriers to make
longer distance trips with the removal of the Regional fare would increase the benefits of the proposed fare
changes and reduce the difference between the overall customer population and minority and low-income
customers. Further, increased electronic MyRide adoption among minority and/or low-income customers would
increase the benefits of the proposed fare changes and reduce the difference between the overall customer
population and minority and low-income customers.

8.2.1 Key Findings
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.05 per boarding for all customers, $0.97 for minority customers (8% lower than for all customers)
and $0.84 for low-income customers (20% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a smaller decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 23.1% decrease in their average fare
per boarding and low-income customers experience a 22.0% decrease, compared with a 25.4% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. It is important to note that each group (overall, minority
and low-income) is anticipated to see an average fare per boarding decrease of 22% or greater.

●

A significant reason for the overall customer population experiencing greater average fare benefits
compared to minority and low-income customers is that the proposed fare changes disproportionately
benefit customers paying the Regional fare, which is disproportionately non-minority and non-lowincome according to the 2019 CSS.
○

Regional boardings represent 8% of minority customer boardings and 5% of low-income customer
boardings, but represent 10% of boardings for the overall customer population.

●

Low-income customers do not benefit from the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program. The
proposed fare change increases the household income limit from 185% of the federal poverty level to
250% of the federal poverty level. Both of these income limits exceed the income threshold of 150% of
federal poverty level established by RTD Title VI Policies and used for the purposes of this Fare Equity
Analysis.

●

Minority and low-income customers do not benefit as greatly as the overall customer population from the
introduction of fare capping given their lower electronic fare adoption.
○

For full fare, 34% of overall 3-Hour and Day Pass boardings are made with electronic fares, while
this decreases to 24% and 17% for minority and low-income customers, respectively.

●

The proposed changes to the Business EcoPass program result in minority and low-income customers
benefiting more than the overall customer population. This is largely a function of the demographics and
proposed changes to the Airport portion of the Business EcoPass program. Within the Business EcoPass
program, the Airport fare level has a significantly higher share of minority and low-income customers than
the Local and Regional fare levels, and the Airport fare level for Business EcoPass has the largest
anticipated percentage decrease in average fare resulting in a greater benefit for minority and low-income
customers.

●

The proposed changes to the CollegePass program result in minority and low-income customers
benefiting less than the overall customer population. This is largely a result of the fact that the Local fare
level has the highest proportion of minority and low-income customers, yet is anticipated to experience
a relatively low percentage decrease in average fare. Regional and Airport fare levels have much larger
shares of non-minority and non-low-income customers, yet are anticipated to experience much higher
percentage decreases in average fare. It is important to remember that the structure of CollegePass
contracts is such that all utilization across all customer populations at a college (minority, non-minority,

●

As noted in Table 15, the only group that is anticipated to experience an increase in their average fare in
the study are low-income Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) program customers. The estimated change in
average fare per boarding for these customers is $0.03. Proposed changes are expected to result in
minority customers also benefiting less than the overall NECO customer population. Low-income NECO
customers in particular disproportionately rely on the Local fare level within the NECO program (90% of
Low-Income NECO boardings are Local vs. 73% of overall NECO boardings), yet the Local fare level for
NECO is the one that is anticipated to experience a sizable increase in average fare due to the proposal to
no longer take into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities in contract
pricing. While the Average Fare Analysis suggests that low-income and minority NECO customers are
anticipated to benefit less than the overall population of NECO customers, it is important to remember
that all utilization across all customer populations (minority, non-minority, low-income, non-low-income)
is aggregated together and all households in the same neighborhood pay an identical amount.

8.2.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 16 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $1.26 to $0.97, a 23.1% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.41 to $1.05, a 25.4% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is +2.3%, indicating that
while both groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat
more than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare
changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on
minority customers as the percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed
fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.41 to $1.05, a 25.4% decrease. The percentage
point difference between the percentage change for low-income customers and all customers is +3.4%, indicating
that while both groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit more

As previously noted, individuals with a household income up to 250% of the federal poverty level will be eligible
for the expanded LiVE Program, which exceeds the low-income threshold of 150% of the federal poverty level
established in RTD’s Title VI Policies. As such, there are individuals in the Average Fare Analysis that are classified
as non-low-income but will benefit from the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program.

9 Cumulative Findings and Mitigations

Even though RTD’s ridership is not homogenous in terms of ethnicity, income, payment methods or fare type, the
proposed fare changes do not appear to create any Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear
to create any Disproportionate Burdens on low-income communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order
to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes.
Equity was the primary goal for the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. As changes to RTD’s fare structure,
pricing and system were considered to achieve other study goals including Affordability and Simplicity, the impacts
of these potential changes on minority and low-income communities were continually examined. The study relied
on a community-driven process, focused on Title VI and historically underrepresented populations. Customer,
community and stakeholder engagements were undertaken to identify unmet needs and potential impacts and
to obtain fare structure preferences among minority and low-income communities.

A Fare Equity Analysis should not take the place of thoughtful planning at the earliest stages of project
development. Considering the impacts that plans, programs or projects have on minority and low-income
communities has been part of the early planning and development process for the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis and the study’s recommendations.

It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
changes upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
While no adverse impacts on minority and low-income customers were identified, RTD continues to focus on
initiatives that support the customer experience for minority and low-income customers. As discussed in Section
6.1.8, RTD is looking at expanded MyRide retail opportunities for customers who prefer to pay with cash, and are
developing a public outreach and engagement plan to promote the LiVE program (See Appendix B) throughout
the region. Both of these initiatives are expected to improve the customer experience for minority and low-income
customers.
It should also be noted that this Fare Equity Analysis does not evaluate a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program or
expansion of MyRide retail opportunities for cash customers. A separate Fare Equity Analysis for these may be
required as applicable. The Fare Equity Analysis also did not examine administrative programs that are being
contemplated or developed for the expansion of means testing beyond the current system used in the LiVE
Program, or programs intended to improve outreach and engagement to promote the LiVE Program. Should the
criteria for LiVE eligibility change, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required.

Summary
In 2019, RTD introduced the LiVE Income-based Fare Discount Program (LiVE program) that allows eligible
customers to save 40% off RTD full fares. The discount is available directly to the customer, and they can apply
for the LiVE discount through the Colorado PEAK website. Currently, participants qualify if they are between the
ages of 20 and 64, live within the RTD service area and have a household income at or below 185 percent of the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL).
As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study), RTD is recommending changes to the LiVE
program that would increase the number of income-eligible customers who would be eligible for LiVE Discount
fares. The recommended changes will need to be communicated to the public. This plan aims to identify strategies,
resources, and partners to communicate about these changes (once finalized) and ensure that income-eligible
customers receive the information and support they need to fully participate in and benefit from the program.

Objective

Current State
The LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount Program is currently available to customers who:




Are between the ages of 20 and 64
Live within the RTD service area
Have a household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines, set annually by the
Department of Health and Human Services based on household size and income

LiVE applications are processed through PEAK, the state's public benefits website. Customers enrolled in LiVE
currently receive a 40% fare discount. LiVE discounts currently apply only to mobile and MyRide 3-Hour Passes,
mobile Day Passes and paper and mobile 10 ride ticket books. Access-a-Ride fares do not receive a LiVE discount
in the current fare structure.

LiVE Program Expansion Recommendation
RTD is recommending changes to the LiVE program including increasing the discount from 40% to 50%. Other
changes would increase the number of income-eligible customers who would be eligible for Discount fares. These
changes are as follows.

Increase the Income a Household Can Earn to Qualify
Currently, individuals with a household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines qualify for this
program. That means, for example, a family of four with a household income of $55,500 or is income-eligible for
the LiVE program discount. RTD is recommending that individuals with a household income at or below 250% of
the federal poverty guidelines be eligible for the LiVE program. Under the new recommendation, a family of four
could make a household income of $75,000 or less and qualify for the discount.

Eliminate the Requirement to Have an In-District Address
RTD is recommending eliminating the requirement to provide a home or mailing address within RTD boundaries
as a qualification for the LiVE program. Doing so would simplify and streamline the enrollment process, provide
more equitable access to customers who are unhoused or underhoused, and provide access to customers who use
RTD but live just outside of the District boundaries.

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

To reach and educate customers and the public (especially those who are income-eligible) about changes to RTD’s
LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount Program, encourage participation in the program and provide the informational
and logistical support needed to ensure a smooth transition for the LiVE program expansion.

Apply LiVE Discounts to Access-a-Ride Fares
RTD is recommending expanding LiVE discounts to include Access-a-Ride fares for customers who qualify for and
enroll in the program. That would mean that Access-a-Ride customers with household incomes at or below 250%
of the federal poverty guidelines would be eligible for a lower fare, paying $2.25 for the Standard fare (all current
Local and Regional routes) and $9.50 for travel to and from the airport. Visit the Access-a-Ride page for more

information. In addition, the age limits for LiVE eligibility would not apply to Access-a-Ride customers since youth
and senior discounts are not provided for Access-a-Ride fares.

RTD is exploring opportunities to work with community partners to help individuals apply for LiVE. RTD is also
exploring ways to verify an individual is income-eligible outside of the PEAK system and in addition to income
verification by Denver Human Services. Community partners would provide local, trusted support to help incomeeligible customers to enroll in and benefit from Discount fares, increasing the use of equity programs. Verifying
eligibility outside of the PEAK system would simplify and streamline the process for income-eligible customers who
have provided similar documentation through other entities.

Strategy
Through a mix of in-system printed assets, digital and social media channels, community events, open houses,
meetings, in-person and virtual presentations as well as Public Relations efforts, RTD will inform customers and
the public about the finalized changes to the LiVE program as a result of the Study.

Transit Equity Office – Language Access
Based on 2021 RTD survey data, non-English-speaking customers indicated that they rode RTD at least a few
times per week, with a quarter indicating that they rode RTD every single day. The results of this survey along
with other national data illustrates that non-English-speaking populations may rely on public transportation services
more than people who speak English as a preferred language. Additionally, non-English-speaking populations have
a high concentration of immigrants, refugees, asylee seekers and others who, as a result of low incomes given
legal and logistical barriers to fully participate in local economic opportunities, would qualify for the revised LiVE
program. Consequently, the 2024 LiVE program outreach must ensure that it provides language access to
information on the LiVE program changes as well as adequate language assistance support. While all LiVE materials
and the PEAK application itself are currently available in Spanish, this is not the case for other languages.

All Communications assets produced for 2024 LiVE outreach will include a short boilerplate on
language assistance services available (e.g., interpretation and translation)
Press releases will be translated into Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese and distributed to relevant
multicultural media groups
Transit Equity Office will work with Public Relations staff to offer a Spanish translation of News Stop
articles related to the LiVE program expansion
Transit Equity Office will work with Communications to translate all key assets (e.g., instructions to
apply on PEAK) into Vietnamese and Chinese. The most relevant assets will be strategized by priority
and translated into RTD’s safe harbor languages using the Language Access Plan as guidance and
by working with resettlement agencies/immigrant- and refugee-focused community-based
organizations to identify the most needed resources and languages
Transit Equity Office will identify multilingual community-based organizations and events to host
presentations and Q&A sessions on the LiVE program updates, working with the appropriate
interpreters as needed. Potential organizations include (but are not limited to) Spring Institute,
African Community Center, Boulder County for All, Montbello Organizing Committee and DRMAC
Provide links to the most relevant translated assets on the new LiVE program on the LiVE webpage
on rtd-denver.com as well as other relevant pages

Target Audiences
The target audience of this outreach should center individuals who would benefit the most from the LiVE program
changes as well as the organizations that serve these individuals. Specifically, this entails outreach to people with
low incomes, BIPOC, seniors, non-English-speaking populations (e.g., immigrants and refugees) and people with
disabilities.

Is RTD concerned about being able to fund the fare free after the pilot? Or are you thinking that can
roll forward without hiccups?
I am absolutely amazed at how this process went and in what you have come up with. I think it's
brilliant. It will help so many people. Thank you so much for this.
I believe that the fare structure will help especially those who rely heavily on RTD transportation in
their daily lives. I believe that it fair policies and programs. Working as a case worker the support RTD
provides to our families in immeasurable and astounding.
Thank you for your service during the pandemic, you are awesome.
I definitely appreciate the added security - makes me feel safer to ride.
Please lower rates.
I am all for it! Reduce fares yay!
Yes! Reduce fares!
This is a great package of changes. I’m on board with the higher airport cost as it still is the most
affordable option vs Uber or parking. However, I tend to still choose Uber or parking because of the
train schedules that don’t line up which make an already lengthy journey even longer when you
deboard your train at Union Station and find out you just missed the connection you needed. An
increase in frequency of trips (or slightly adjusted to make those types of connections more possible)
would make me reevaluate using the train.
I agree with the proposed RTD fare changes and believe that if fares were lowered, RTD would be
more attractive as a method of transportation around the Denver Metro area.
Fare structure- recommend a tap on tap off structure like in Sydney Australia that you can use credit
card or local card. It avoids educating on fairs and you can keep short trips cheaper than the 3 hour
rule currently. Cost based on tap on and tap off rather than time can increase revenue based on
infrequent users and still create predictible revenue and access for frequent users. Recommend
researching their system if that hasn't been done. Programs- offer families with school age children
who qualify for government programs to access free transit for adults and children. Offer stop gap
emergency cards to schools to support families experiencing homelessness, lost a car, or are highly
mobile. Right now schools can apply for a nonprofit discount but would love to be able to give out
free monthly cards as needed that cover an adult and their children to reduce chronic absenteeism
and support highly mobile families with staying at a consistent school. Also having a way to send the
passes and cards to schools rather than a centralized location can help networks and individual
schools have passes regularly without needing to ship them or drive them to each location.
I think this is a fantastic idea and will help to further encourage greater usage of RTD services!
I wholeheartedly support all of these recommendations. This is the type of policy that impacts our
hardest working Coloradans, our young people, and people in need. We all win with this type of
forward thinking. My favorite though is the no-cost youth pass! Louisville, KY did this a decade ago
and it was a game changer for youth development. Well done, team RTD!
I am a big supporter of the new fare structure. I think these changes will lead to more ridership and
they make me more likely to use the RTD system more often. I hope we continue to implement
changes like these to encourage greater use of public transportation.

I support the new fare structure that lowers cost and simplifies the fares. I utilize the train to get from
my home in Arvada to the airport approximately 3-4 times a year. I also use the train occasionally to
go into Denver to attend sporting events, concerts, and meet with friends near Union Station. In all of
these cases, taking the train lessens the hassle and cost of parking, which is appreciated. Simpler fare
structure helps with our out of town guests as well. It's great to have the train as an option when
friends are visiting from out of town, so they can access the city and the airport independently if
needed. I also really appreciate the changes to the policies and programs to help make utilizing the
train an affordable and accessible choice for all populations in Denver. I think these programs and
the efforts towards Fare Equity will go a long way to increase the use of the train system in Denver.
I do wish the Gold line ran more frequently and that there was expanded access from Denver to
Boulder. Maybe with increased usage over time, we'll see initiatives like these become a reality.
I really appreciate the overall simplification of fares, which will benefit everyone. Although I use the
RTD app, which makes paying easy, it can be tricky to figure out how much a trip is going to cost these
days. The new plan will be easier. Also, as a Senior, I'm excited to note the lower cost, especially for
trips to the airport. The new package looks good!
I believe that the fare structure will help especially those who rely heavily on RTD transportation in
their daily lives. I believe that it fair policies and programs. Working as a care worker and the support
RTD provides to our facilities is immeasurable and astounding.
Thank you for your service during the Pandemic. You are awesome.
I definatly appreciate the added security makes me feel safer to ride.
Fare structure can be confusing especially when using bus+ lightrail/commuter rail. Also a study
needs to be done to make routes more efficient. RTD is usually slower than driving in traffic.
Accepting credit/debit card would be useful too.
Lower fares enable people to get to work, improving the city economy!
I would like to see the Recommended Fare structure implemented. Also return of the FF2 route and
the promised Boulder-Denver rail line.
Simple is better and encourages more riders
Great to make available to those most needing services and more accessible.
Its scary. (I just have anxiety, nothing against RTD)
I have taken RTD since 1978. Only stopped during co-vid and have not started again. Concerns are
park-n-ride safety and union station. Otherwise I feel RTD does a great job.
I like how often the rides are.
Like the "spin the wheel" that they added, like the ambiance and info that is given out. Like the offers
that are given out as well
Love it! No more local/regional fares is a great idea!
One flat rate would be nice so its not complicated
I want fare change for cheaper fares
Standard rate for everything It is very confusing
Fares and charges should be lowered for non-students and the youth. Youth/children should have
lower charges or even no charge at all depending on their ages. Children have no concept of traveling
and are often with their designated guardian or adult, which should be enough charge for their ride
alone.
Fare simplification would be benefit our region. We live between N-line 112th and 104th station and
it seems odd to change regions between the two. Using a local-only fare would allow us to use all
stations equally and benefit lower-income commuters in the higher density areas north of 104th
station.

The goal of a fare structure that's easy to understand and affordable for all is spot on. A simple and
affordable fare structure by default should be equitable too. The youth population would be well
served by the improvements. The Zero Fare for Youth proposal is most promising not only as a
method to increase access to the transit system and promote transit in the near term but also to
cultivate future patrons of public transportation. Many thanks to RTD staff for conducting this
exhaustive study.
Really good and helpful survey
Charges for riding the RTD bus, being a student is fair however can have safety concerns regarding the
bus in general. Generally, I feel and agree with the study's decisions to have a reward system for
frequent users, no fees for children and better discounts for elderly or even vet. Children under the
ages of 5 or 6 should not be charged or have a significantly lower fee due to their age. A rewards
system would not only benefit present users but also encourage more people to use public
transportation frequently.
RTD is really helpful for people with no transportation.
Its really helpful for people with no transportation.

The new recommendations are needed and appreciated
Make regional pass be for more than 1 day
Reduce fare is great IDEA- For Retirees
The transportation in certain neighborhoods where people of color live is decreasing in availability the
RTD board should look at studying the lack of access they are providing to people of color in a lower
economic bracket.
I really like taking public transportation but I don't like going to Union Station Because of the
homeless people. They should only allow people using public transportation to enter the building.
Otherwise its great to get around.
Can you get the 10 bus to Aurora CO. It was going over there. Now it don't.
I have an elderly mother 95 who I take with me on excursions for fun and stimulis. The ride you offer
is great but I could do it more with lower fares. My sister-in-law was mentally challeneged and she
rode your ride daily. It was a life saver! Thank you. Esther
I agree with the statement
Bus Passes are Reasonabily Prices (114) - SAVES Money. ECO Pass Available for ECE-Catholic
Charities? Please look into it.
Fare pricing needs to be controlled to allow access to all income levels!
I needed to ride RTD for work 2010-2015. I was living on less than $20K /year. Every dollar counted.
Someone in the position I was in needs the change in fare. I'm all for it.
I would like to see the fare on RTD be lowered to help people that can't afford the fares as they are
structured today. Veterans should have a discount, students, the over 55 riders. Thanks. PS: RTD
should also make a way to give jobs to people that have bad things happened to them and give them
a second chance at life. God's giving us a second chance. :)
I think it’s a great idea
All riders should pay something, the "No-cost transit for youth ages 19 and under through the Zero

Attachment: Attachment B - Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report (4791 : Title VI Fare Equity Analysis)

Overall, the recommended fare structure goes a long way towards making RTD more affordable and
easier to use. However, increasing the time window for a single fare from three to four hours would
make it a more appealing and useful option for riders. With the current three hour travel window,
many riders are forced to purchase a second fare due to traffic congestion, transit delays and other
circumstances. A longer travel window would give riders more of a time buffer against delays to
complete their trip. This would make the fare a more practical alternative to a day pass for riders
wishing to go to a single destination, such as a medical appointment, grocery shopping or other
errand. Therefore, while the proposed regional and monthly pass rates as well as the consolidation
of the local and regional pricing helps encourage commuters to ride RTD for long distance trips, more
could be done to make public transit more compelling for shorter trips. A lower priced base fare or a
longer travel window would encourage more people to choose RTD for local errands and
appointments.
I like the streamlined pricing. I think this is a step in the right direction for more equity with ridership.
I feel there's a real need for customers to feel safe before you can bring back customers to riding
more. Once we have established safety I think proceeding with more routes, particularly at rush hour
times. It seems we've taken away routes instead of adding.
I frequently visit a good friend in Collinsville, Illinois. That is 29 miles from the airport (but not the end
of the line, which is Scott Air Force Base. From the airport to Scott AFB is $2 for seniors. The return
trip fare is based on the station where I board the train. My 29 mile ticket is $1.25.
The recommended fair is still too excessive if you consider someone who works at the airport has to
pay $10 one way per day equaling over $300 a month. I own a car and would like often to take the
train instead but it's cheaper to drive the car even at the gas prices as high as they are today. Because
the stops are so close together the regional ticket should be abolished and that should just be all local
there's nothing that far apart in the metro area. In Dallas you can go between Dallas and fort Worth
for $10 all day long on a day pass on the train you can also have an option on the bus to buy a day
pass for just double the single ride pass and it lasts all day. The reduction of the tickets you have
proposed are literally 25 cent less or 50 cents less not substantial enough to make a difference the
$88 a month pass seems to be the best option but many low income people are not able to come up
with $88 at one time. A weekly pass maybe a good alternative thank you.
I think this fare structure is a really good choice. Standardizing fares for all non-airport journeys
should have positive effects on ridership. And the reduction in price for monthly passes is a great idea
from both a ridership and equity perspective. These changes need to be implemented as soon as
possible.
Please include all students who are registered/enrolled in high school in the pilot program for free
RTD access (this includes students with disabilities who are over the age of 19 but are still enrolled in
public school)
Charge what you like. I can't afford to become a drug addict by riding your vehicles.
I like the proposal, I feel like it would encourage me to ride the commuter rail more often.
I am someone who mostly uses transit to get downtown for leisure activities (I work in the
neighborhood I live in). But the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program really excites me. Right now my son
is 3, and I find it reasonable to pay for a ticket for myself and take him for free on a visit to downtown.
But I've already thought that I wouldn't be as likely to do so after he gets older and passes the age
limit to ride for free. And after we have a second kid, whoo! Definitely wouldn't see that as an
inexpensive way to get around. I love the idea of increasing the age limit for youth to ride free. It
would greatly increase my likelihood of continuing to use public transit.
Hello. I am over 65 and occasionally use RTD. I like having one fare for all zones. Also, and this may
sound strange, but I think the discounted fares for seniors are too generous. For me to go to the
airport for only 1.35 is amazing. Great for us, but a loss of revenue for RTD.

I don’t mind about the cost of the fares so long as we, the riding public, are safe on the bus and trains.
What needs to be addressed is the safety and welfare of everyone. I have witnessed people doing
drugs inside the train and the filth left by those who have nothing to lose in life. While law abiding
people are like zombies inside - not moving for fear of their own safety. I have seen the decline of
paying and law abiding public riders because of this mess. Even RTD employees are saying they won’t
allow their family to ride public transport anymore. Police visibility is key. It pains me so much to say
that this is no longer the RTD I used to know. I feel sorry for the situation it is in now. Thank you.
nope
I very much support the simplification of the fare structure. Hopefully it will make all users more
inclined to use RTC and for RTD to then enhance (increase) service along key corridors to at least
every 15 minute frequency. I appreciate that outlying counties pay for service (and deserve it), but
we really do need to focus on the everyday trunk line service instead of commuter service. I hope
that these economical pricing tiers make that more feasible for more people. I particularly like the
$88/monthly pass as that seems more likely to be purchased as a "nice to have" option even for
someone that may commute by car a few times/week. I think the fare capping is great, but probably
needs to be explained a few times (and doesn't work with cash), so distribution of farecards may be a
good promotion even if they only have one ride pre-loaded (but the card is reloadable).
I would bet that the August month last year when there was no fee to ride transit went over well. I
think it would be good to try a Transit Week several times during the year. Get companies with staff
working downtown to get a break. Also, the buses, such as Number 10, Number 0, the Mall Shuttle
all have maintenance issues--have you travelled on some of these buses yourselves??? I would guess
Number 15 is the same way. Thanks for listening.
The proposed fare change is a good idea for all
After learning that the RTD My Card and app can be synced, I had to spend quite some browsing and
searching Google/RTD for info on the app. Finally found the section and ordered the card. There
needs to be more education on where to get the card and how to sync it. Phones do die and this is a
great alternative for when you don't have your phone and or don't want to carry. Also if buying
through the card/ app maxes out at the monthly pass price under the new structure. Why can't that
be implemented now even under the current structure???
Registering my support for the new fare structure. As a Boulder resident, I know that lower regional
fares will make me use RTD *more* often to get to and from Denver. I am also in support of any
policy that makes public transit more accessible to low-income residents and visitors.
I think it should be similar to how Minneapolis does it. Plus no extra fare to get to the airport. Not
every employer pays for an Eco pass, or for parking, and it can get expensive for employees who work
there.
The proposed fare structure is still too expensive. RTD should lower it's fares even further to assist
low-income riders, disadvantaged communities and the environment.
As a senior citizen who has a disability and mainly uses public transportation, RTD, I am very grateful
to l those who have worked tirelessly to create the new fare structure. Since I live on my Social
Security checks my income is set and with 1) so many services 2) rent 3) food 4) medicines and 5)
phone use going up, RTD'S efforts to show kindness and consideration to populations such as mine is
a Godsend. I also live in a virtual food desert so a walk doesn't get me to a viable grocery store. I
believe this will help many people in the Denver Metro area and beyond. Thank you for your
extensive work! I'm definitely a fan of RTD!
The new fare structure would be great,and more affordable.

I highly recommend this fare structure! RTD's fares are some of the highest in the country and do not
provide value for money in my opinion. I commute to the airport 5 days a week, and the new monthly
pass cost would make it much more feasible for me to take the train almost every day. In addition
to the new fare structure, I also recommend that RTD implement 3 and 7 day passes, like many other
transit systems have. This will make it more affordable for visitors to the Denver metro to travel by
transit rather than having to Uber/Lyft or rent a car.
Good revision to the fare structure. Easy to understand and simple to follow.
While the no cost fare idea for Youth may seem attractive, experience elsewhere demonstrates that
some youth will choose to simply board RTD for a frolic or, worse, to annoy or harass other
passengers. Large city transit (NYC, Phila, LA, etc) companies are having significant problems with
youth, including gangs and delinquents who prey upon other riders, occupy handicapped seating and
generally engage in boisterous or disrespectful conduct; regrettably this is fact in 2023. (Look at
experience on Mall Shuttles , Union Station, etc). RTD needs to charge all riders some fare -even if
modest or nominal - to preserve the ability of bona fide users from joy riders, etc. If this is ignored, no
one will choose to ride RTD and subject himself or herself to annoyance and harassment.
Your pricing structure for ECO passes does not make sense. You charge companies a flat price based
upon number of employees regardless if they would use the program or not. If this is not intended,
this is exactly how your contract is interpreted. For instance, one of the largest locations for
employment is the airport (over 35,000 employees). Airlines refuse to buy into the ECO program
because you are charging almost $60.00 per month, per employee that they have (not that are local).
Based upon the definitions of ECO pass pricing, they have 1000's of employees across their companies
(not all local) so most of what they are charged for could never participate. Therefore, you are
missing some of the largest employers in the region (remember that + 35,000 employees at the
airport) because it is cost prohibitive for them to offer such a benefit; especially when parking only
costs $36.00 per month for employees. Why be overcharged due to out of state employees and also
pay almost $60.00 per employee, when they may pay $36.00 to the city for parking? With your
current pricing structure you are missing great opportunity for the very large employers such as
airlines and concessions. Make it simple and offer a blanket cost for SIDA badged employees at the
airport that is competitive to the $36.00 per month parking fee).
I am hugely disappointed in the lack of innovation and creativity in this study. I was expecting a
refresh in fare structure, including at least considering the possibility of abolishing the 3-hour pass
that no one likes; and all we got for regular fares is a 25-cent discount and no more regional level??
Did you know that Denver has one of the most expensive transit systems in the country? It is cheaper
to drive a family of 5 to the airport and park there than it is to take the train--one way! In every other
city I have lived in, fare is based on how far you're traveling, not a fixed (and very high) price. If I am
taking a bus 5 stops down the road, why the heck am I paying 3 dollars?? Sorry, $2.75. In other cities
that would cost me a dollar, maybe less. This study was a wonderful opportunity, and it was
completely wasted. Shame on you, RTD.
Of course I think the new fare structure looks great - simplified and much cheaper. But however will
you meet operating costs at those rates? We are not low-income, but I always do keep in mind how
to help low-income people - while high earners can afford more. High earners should pay more, but
less than it would cost drivers to park downtown. Many corporate jobs with good benefits offer
transit pay, e.g. I used to receive $65 a month to offset the cost of taking mass transit. $6 for a day
pass is perfectly reasonable. For the monthly pass, there should be two rates - one regular at $200
per month, then a $90 one for low-income or airport employees. For people using the A line just for
travel - make it more expensive, but less than getting a cab/Uber ride or paying for parking. e.g. I'd
pay $20 for a round trip to the airport when traveling. (However I DON'T use RTD to go the airport
because I don't trust the train to actually get me there / on time to make my flight.) I realize you can't

rescind these low prices after you've publicized them, but obviously if you couldn't be profitable at

Excellent! The new simplified approach and thoughtful and appropriate discounts should really

Hello. I voted for light rail and am a believer and user of public transportation around the world……as
long as I feel safe on it. I DO FEEL SAFE ON THIS LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM! I used to, but I no longer do!!! I
am very disappointed on how it is being overseen. There needs to be consistent security on the trains
and at the stations! I stopped using light rail after too many encounters with a lot of the passengers
struggling with mental illness, homeless riding it to stay warm, out of control youth and drug users. It
is an absolute shame and something needs to change before I will go back to using it in our city.
Senior citizen fares should be less than 50% of full fares. Also, because of safety concerns for the very
elderly, consider free transit for anyone 75 years of age or older using public RTD services.
This is great! I think it simplifies a lot of things while encouraging an interest in use.
The people that are using the RTD system, need better prices and easy access to buses and train
Please reduce the day pass to $5! Also, the light rail feels unsafe at times. Is there a way to increase
the presence of RTD staff or security especially at Union Station?
The fare changes will help so many individuals that rely on public transportation. Our non-profit will
be able to help more clients with the lower fare rates. Especially monthly passes. I like the idea of the
youth not having to worry about having money to get to school, work, and home. It may help some
avoid having to choose between bus fare or eating that day. It can help the kid who is forced to take
the bus, but can barely afford it. Everything is getting more expensive, and would be helpful for our
community to not worry about affording public transportation.
Good job
I don't ride the bus
I don't catch the bus
Please start enforcing the fares. It is pathetic how many homeless and drug addicts just hop on these
trains and buses and move around freely wherever they please around the Denver area. You wouldn’t
need to increase the fares constantly if there was enforcement. People living in the outskirts of town
aren’t going to ride the light rail if they don’t feel safe and all that recent expansion will be for
nothing. Enforcement is absolutely necessary.
Its cool
Riders from N Line 124th Eastlake Station waited a long time for the train while paying taxes toward
the project, then were penalized with higher fares. Abolishing higher fare zone ends confusion about
fares and makes fares fair for all riders

fundamentally REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION is inequitable and impacts most of all indigent people
trying to go to and from appointments, work and take care of families, but also, people who have
fixed incomes. For all of these people the transit needs to be more robust and free. The inequities of
not being able to live on the corridors of the transit system and for people, like myself, who use
bicycles the RTD system and its connections are fraught with limits and scheduling where to catch the
trains making connections for outlying areas is unwieldy. We need a cross-section of transit options
that accommodate people who have medical and mental challenges. IF we really want to make transit

This makes it easier for me to go to Denver because it's cheaper. Thank you.
I like the prices. Are babies free. I have to bring my baby and I hope I don't have to pay extra for her.
I like the local. I can get around Boulder better now.
These fares will make me take the bus more. It is a lot cheaper which is good because I have a lot of
places to go to. I hope the drivers have change its hard when they keep the change.
There should be a fare for people who are disabled that is better than these. Focus said I can still get
my discount on top of these fares but it's not in writing so I hope you all are still going to do that.
The new fares are great. It makes it easier to get around between towns. Thank you.
I go from Boulder and Longmont a lot so I really like the regional fare. The bus is free in Longmont so
that doesn't matter much to me.
I don't really take the bus in Boulder. I like the light rail in Denver. If the bus and light rail changes are

I really like the regional price.
I agree that the fares are a better fit for people riding the buses & trains
Please clean up the trains. They do not feel safe since they are rarely patroled and the fabric seats are
disgusting germ factories. Tired of people smoking pot/cigarettes/cigars on the train. I will drive and
sit in traffic because I do not feel safe and the trains are disgusting.
You should like, destroy most of the R line and re-do it. All the other lines go fast because they go
straighter. The R Line sucks because there’s like a bunch of tight curves or whatever. It’d be a lot
cooler if it followed the freeway and went faster n stuff. You could still use the old tracks that you’ve
already built; just turn it into a trolley or something and build a new track between Colfax and Florida
for a properly fast light rail. Also you could add a stop next to the In n’ Out Burger, that would be cool.
I like the new fare structure it's so much easier to understand I just hope that if you get increased
riders you do ensure people are paying and not using it as a moving homeless encampment.

to 80$ makes it redily available for all

Removal of regional fare - Yes. I think it will make traveling simpler and more affordable.
I thought the fares were pretty fair before but I'm happy to be able to tell my friends the airport will
be cheaper.
I support all of the above and will park my car and take public transportation IF it passes!
Think it great that RTD is thinking about changing the fare for monthly pass and free student fare.
Love the free fare for kids and would love to see it made permanent! I hope my son will be able to
take the bus to hang out with friends and go to events and this would make it so much easier! Also we
take the bus and train to Boulder and Airport so appreciate the fare reductions there. Finally, so many

I think RTD is changing people's lives within the community. I am thankful for the beneficial free fares
for our youth. I know a few kids that need this so much! This will help them succeed. Thank you RTD.
As a parent with two kids, free youth fares would encourage us to ride the train more often. The
additional cost of paying for the whole family makes it more expensive than parking, so we usually
drive. We are season pass holders at Elitches, so this would definitely be useful for us.
I live near Green Valley Ranch and my work is on Jackson Gap Rd. The area has more warehouses and
factories but they are having trouble staffing because there are no transit options. Would like if they
expanded the 42 or 45.
As a senior living in the Baker neighborhood, fervent about traffic/pollution/transportation issues in
Denver, I fully support lowering prices for monthly RTD passes. Let's make ridership accessible and
affordable for all, and reduce car traffic!
Like the idea of creating a monthly pass that encourages regular use including airports. Also like the
social equity aspect of the Live program.
I like the proposed fare reduction and simplification. $1.35 fare doesn't make sense for low income make it a whole $ amount.
I want to see the transit system continue to grow and connect communities. We need more routes,
decreased fare, cleanliness and safety measures increased for Colorado (Denver) transit system.
These changes to the economic system is so great and creates a more accessible community and will
ultimately help the environment!
As a student who doesn't have a car, these changes are fantastic! I'll be more able to get to work.
Love this! Making public transportation as accessible as possible financially is huge and helps people
have more economic opportunities.
I think it's mucho bien. I'm 64 and there's not a lot of work and it would be good to do that. I live in
Denver.
This will be good for a lot of people who're disabled and don't have a lot of money. I'm surprised it
was so expensive.
I ride the buses a lot and me and my wife are on SSDI and the cost of what it was was way too
expensive. A cheaper pass means we can put it to something else.
I take the bus every other day. I'd much rather have it cheaper because the fare seems like it goes up
and the town halls feel useless. This should help people take the bus more but I would like to see it
lower.
I like it! Thanks :)
Overall, I support the new proposed fares. The best change is the Regional monthly pass fee. This will
help many achieve access. The minimal reduction in single adult fare is not as good. Still room for
improvement there to help our community achieve access to public transportation.
I live in Broomfield and needed to commute to both Boulder and now Denver for the 4 years I have
lived here. Many times I have considered and honestly dreamed of using public transportation, but
driving has always been more timely. Now that I work close to Union Station, I am again interested in
using public transportation. The new fare structure would make it much more appealing for someone
like me, who lives in the suburbs to use the bus. Even though the time it takes to get to work may not
change due to these policies, the reduction in fare rates makes it much more worth the time. I wish
Colorado could be a leader for the country when it comes to public transportation and though we
have a long way to go, these new fares, policies, and changes that create greater accessibility for
those in need, is certainly a step in the right direction.
I think these lower fares would be very helpful for people like my wife and myself.

The 3-hour window should be increased to 4. When I go to the Performing Arts Complex I end up
having to pay a fair both ways because the window is not long enough. At this point it almost makes it
non practical because I could just drive down there and pay for parking for a couple bucks more
I ride the bus to and from work and think the amount to ride is a little expensive, the proposed
amount would be great.
The reduce rate of Live will help so much on bringing in more riders weekly, if not daily, for even
individuals on fixed income.
I am all for the proposed fare structure change and think that free fare for youth will greatly increase
use and accessibility for many many people
I am in support of the proposed structures. I wish there was Apple Pay.
I am all for a lower fare for the bus considering it is the daily commute of my daughter to and from
school. Also the free youth fare for a year is an awesome idea to bring youth out into the community
and around the city
I appreciate the reduced fares and actually think they should be free. If they are simplified, I think
they should be rounded to $2 for a few hours and $5 for all day.
Elimination of zones is so smart! We have to do that. Good on ya
It's better to lower cost for RTD. makes me w Less worried about public transit.
It should be cheap for those who cannot afford to pay/afford a car.
It’s great to reduce the price of public transport to get more cars off the road
I think that the fair structures look fair. I like the day pass option that is affordable
I think the new fare structure is an improvement. I do think there should be youth fare discounts
I believe public transit should be free for all. Anyone that rides public transit is doing thw world a
favor. Less cars on the road. Less gas consumed. This should be rewarded with free fare. Its not a
handout. Its a way if life and it is helping preserve the world.
Support the lower rate of bus passes. Would like to see more light rail.
Cheaper fare
So more people can benefit. Also maybe more working people will once again take this
transportation. I am now concerned about taking it because there is so much violence
Bring back the 16L!!!!!
If you really want more people to ride RTD, I would suggest a fare-free month. Then more people will
ride and enjoy the trip.
I think the new fare structure seems much more simple and I am excited that youth will ride free and
costs across the board are decreasing a bit!
Please lower the fare structure to 19 and younger free...thank you
I agree with lower fare prices
Love the simplified fare structure and that kids ride for free. Thanks for supporting families!
Reducing fares, especially monthly passes, makes using RTD much more likely. Reduced local fares
while keeping airport fares up seems smart. PLEASE give free fares to youth to promote transit usage
at a young age
Appreciate the reduction in monthly pass amount. Great work
Make riding safer by removing non paying riders that do drugs on the train
Love the changes, and how it will be less confusing!
Love the reduced monthly pass cost but please bring the discount 3-hour pass cost down to $1.00 and
daily pass cost down to $2.00 as RTD does not give change. This will help make RTD truly affordable
for people who need it most! Thank you.

It's about time fares came down. RTD was my only mode of transit other than my bike for years and i
would watch the fares go up while quality of service and serice in general decreased or remained the
same. I remember when fare for a monthly pass was under $100 dollars and it was affordable then.
After Covid hit there were service interruptions as was to be expected, and the busses and trains
began running on a weekend schedule which meant some routes were and lines were no longer
running, (such as the 122X) but the worst part about it was over a year later service was still
structured like this with no plans foreseeable to return to normal schedules, and yet fares remained
unchanged. Many riders, myself included felt outrage at this. Not only had we seen a steady annual
increase in fares and a drop in services anyway, how could RTD in good faith be audacious enough to
continue to charge it's riders a full fair when they weren't providing the whole service to its riders?
Inwas paying $114 dollars per month for what? Maybe 3/4 of the use routes and lines offered. RTD
really dropped the ball on that one and for the first time in my ridership did I feel like I was getting
taken by RTD. I hope this plan goes through, and prices do come down. The riders are owed at least
that much.
Why not set the age for Senior Fare to 60 or 62 ? Many seniors take Social Security at 62 and are
retired.
What would the rates for seniors be
Really hope the bus fare can go down xoxo
I am concerned about the under 19 free fare, basically a good idea but might encourage delinquent
kids to act out, commit crimes in places outside their neighborhood if they could just get on
wherever.
Homelessness and crime.
Lower fares for low income/disabled and also free fares for children ages 19 & under would be
beneficial to our community
I see two significant problems with the proposed fare structure: 1. $10/person each way to the
airport, which is $40 R/T for a couple plus $2/day parking, keeps private vehicles and off-site parking
an attractive option. For a family of 4, $80 plus parking. The Airport should cost the same as regional
fares. 2. The flat $2.75 fare has people living in higher density areas--a responsible decision--and
taking short RTD trips subsidizing those living in low-density exhurbs. Philosophically, this is
backwards, but has always been the failing of RTD: its focus on moving people around the suburbs.
Everyone needs equal opportunity
SEIU Local 105 represents over 8,000 members across the Denver Metro Area, the state of Colorado
and the Mountain West. This comment is specifically made on behalf of our Denver Metro Area
members that have difficulty affording and finding accessible transportation to and from their jobs.
Our main concern is that the companies that directly and indirectly employ our members say that the
Eco-Pass benefit some of them provide is too expensive. Although SEIU Local 105 welcomes the
proposed fare structure for businesses, it may still fall short to satiate the need for a better public
transportation experience. This is especially true for areas that currently are far away from major
populated centers, like Denver International Airport (DEN). But the need for a better RTD service is
also true for our 2,500 janitorial members that clean office spaces across the Denver Metro Region.
Most of this work is performed after working hours, when schedules are sparse, presenting a major
difficulty for our members to get back to their loved ones. The issue of high costs for the EcoPass for
employers is also at play. Given these two examples, DEN and the Downtown area and metropolitan
suburbs, SEIU Local 105, strongly encourages RTD to look into creating special incentive zones similar
to what other cities have enacted, including in our own backyard: Boulder. The City of Boulder
Community Vitality Commercial District, where businesses within a certain geographic area are
automatically part of a program where their employees receive a free Eco Pass, is a prime example of

what RTD could accomplish for DEN and the main commuting regions within Metro Denver. Another
idea we welcome, specifically to the DEN workforce, is creating a system of free employee-only
shuttles to and from the airport, connecting with the A-Line, that should also be free to DEN workers.
Airports around the world have a dedicated transportation system for their employees and as a
world-class airport, DEN, RTD and the airlines should work together to study the viability of this
alternative. SEIU Local 105 has also heard about RTD’s conversation to create a master
transportation contract with the airlines at DEN. This master contract should include the contractors
and sub-contractors that provide services to the airlines. Designing a program that excludes the
workers that, through other vendors, directly and indirectly, support the airlines, is a program
destined to fail. Our union looks forward to engaging RTD, DEN, the airlines and other regional and
city government officials to provide additional input and testimony on why contractors and
subcontractors of airlines need to be included in any master airline transportation contract. It is
crucial that fare policies and programs are regularly evaluated and adjusted as needed to ensure that
they continue to meet the needs of workers and low-income riders. If we all want to make Denver
and the Denver Metro Area more green and accessible in terms of jobs, housing and basic needs, we
need to find ways to improve and fix the public transportation grid. Ultimately, by prioritizing the
zones of greater usage within populated centers, but also in far away regions like DEN, RTD can create
a more inclusive and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone in our community. I urge
you to carefully consider SEIU Local 105’s recommendations and to work towards creating a more
equitable and accessible public transportation system in the Denver Metro Area.
Looks great! Much simpler and will really help low income families! Looking forward to the new rail
line to Boulder/Longmont. Hope there is a stop in Gunbarrel!
I really like the simplicity of the new fare structure. I think it will help riders understand it better.
While I appreciate the lowered fares, that personally doesn’t impact me as much. But grouping the
local/ regional together is very helpful.
I just think there should be lowered it's really outrageous to have to commute when a lot of people
are still feeling the covid stuff and it's hard for people to come up with the money for a bus and get
from here to there my self I get help from the empowerment group with bus passes but it's before
that I would have to constantly try to figure out how to get bus where I needed to go so if you guys
would make a structure it's a little bit lower the people could reach for people that are in the lower
income phase or like you said discounted that would be awesome I need to start helping the people
more thank you very much for your time
Bus are very unstable especially on weekend. Bus route is to long especially on the 76-Wadsworth
especially when it snows. We have to wait on 3 or 4 hrs for the Bus. No real back up on the routes.
We have to wait 3 or 4 hrs for an asser ride and back up driver - for when they breakdown call from
dispatch to let us is the bus is running down. Why don't you will try a volunteer dispatch service for
someone closer the call instead of having a customer waiting 4 or 4 hours.
I strongly support the streamlining of RTD’s fare policy, and appreciate greatly the decreased cost of
both individual fares and monthly passes!
Being elderly and disabled and on a fixed income, it is hard to make ends meet as it is. It would be
greatly appreciated if I didn't have to pay so much to ride the bus, which gives me access to my
community and various, much needed, resources. Respectfully, Donna
Thank you for simplifying the fare structure for everyday work commuter, such as myself. It might be
too complicated but I'd love to find out how you all applied a fare equity analysis to this process.
I'm thrilled to see an $88 monthly pass. Between the reduced price and fare capping, it makes the
decision to take RTD instead of driving a no-brainer. The simplification and price reductions of the

It seems to me that the proposed fair structure is much more fair and easier to understand. I am very
much in favor of expanding the access and discount fair program.
I don't ride the bus very much but I will take it more now. I like the regional all day price. The local is
better also
I buy the monthly pass regional/airport. Currently it takes me 20 commutes per month for the
monthly pass to pay off. Some months I don't meet that threshold. Under the new structure, it would
take me 9 commutes. This is such a vast improvement for me and would conjure no hesitation in my
monthly pass purchase. The monthly pass encourages me to ride RTD even when I "need" to, so
cheaper monthly passes would be a plus all around!
I believe that the fares prices should be much lower. A majority of people who use the public
transport systems are lower income folks, and it doesn't make sense to charge so much. Reducing
prices ensures equity of the public transport system. Reducing prices will also increase the number of
folks who use it, reducing our green house gas emissions in Denver.
The regional for the day is the best price.
These prices are great especially the regional. I think the bus should be free for veterans but these
prices are good for everybody else.
I wish it was all free for people with bad health. We have to take the bus a lot for our medical stuff.

This is too much. I am homeless and I can't pay this. The bus should be free if you are homeless.
I like the new changes RTD is proposing in order to create more equitable opportunities in bus fares
for all citizens in RTD's area of work. I like the proposal of making local/regional fares the same price,
and I like the idea of youth bus fares being free.
These prices are good. Now I don't have to ride my bike that much.
I'm glad the price is lower. Is it lower for older people too? I am older and I like senior discounts

As someone who has been closely following the issues w/ fare structures specifically impacting our
clientel (parolees), I can confidently say that the changes being proposed will have a profoundly
positive impact on our community particularly for nonprofits and low income around the city. I was
especially pleased to see the inclusion of the 10% bulk discount; This will help many organizations
save money in the long run. I also believe that this change will make a real difference for those who
have been struggling to afford transportation in the region. Overall, I want to commend the
decision-makers involved for their thoughtful and forward -thinking approach to these issues. It is
clear that those involved have carefully considered the needs of the community and nonprofits and I
am confident that the proposed changes will be felt by many in a truly meaningful way.
I like the new price.
It should be cheaper for people with disabilities. I can't walk and I have to take the bus but I can't
work so the bus is a lot.
I like the cheaper regional. I hope the drivers have change.
I like the structure but I don't understand why local isn't free everywhere. Longmont has free local
buses
$88 still to high to encourage people to leave their vehicles and use more public transportation and
reduce carbon emissions
Equity, and more importantly justice, would be free transit for all. It removes barriers to access.
Reduces stress and anxiety for those most impacted by not expose people to invasive application
processes. Reduces overhead costs of managing upwards of 15 different fare products/structures.
Increases ridership as shown by fare free August 2022. Please end fares and find funding from other

As a long time RTD rider, this recommended fare structure is highly attractive and I hope it passes.
With the delays & frequent cancelations on the A-line, the new monthly fare would make it more
affordability to those moving about in the city who need to find last minute (and sometimes higher
rates on busy/peak ride share) options to get around. Thank you for your consideration.
I DEPEND ON RTD AND RESPECT THEM
The recommended fare structure both simplifies the fare system and lowers fares, making it a great
solution. It will help drive equity as well as higher transit use. A simpler system also will encourage
more tourists and other visitors to use transit as it is not as confusing to have to try to figure out what
zones they will be traveling in.
I support Title V1
Enthusiastic support for fare reductions to improve access! The current fee structure doesn't work
economically, even against downtown parking costs! The new structure will make it much more
accessible to commuters and those who rely on public transportation as their primary mode of
transportation.
I'm not sure if this idea has been discussed, but I wanted to mention it while I had a moment. I've
been a driver for 4+ years, so I have many thoughts about how things could be improved. Relating to
the fares though, I think making a 1-way trip without a transfer should only cost $1. It's not fair to
charge $3 to a passenger that's going 2 miles down the road to get home and also $3 for a passenger
that's going to ride for 40 min, switch busses and ride another half hour. It just doesn't make sense
that both situations are the same fee. I hope this will be implemented.
The safety of our car and belongings at the park and ride (especially 40th) is in danger. I know many
people that got their car stolen or/and broken into multiple times. Insurance doesn’t even cover the
damages. So we need RTD to work on making those parking spaces safe.
The train is always delayed, especially on Saturdays. After being delayed for an hour, the small train
comes and half of the people that have been waiting would not even fit which makes us all late to
work.
There are days I stay at the airport overnight because I miss the last train at 1 am. Most times, I would
be assigned a last-minute passenger and by the time I get the passenger to their destination, clock out
and make it to the train station, it is too late for me to catch the last train of the night, so I sleep in the
airport for the night.
I work for a low income community in north Denver, lower fairs and monthly passes would help out
my resident's greatly
This is an excellent first step to making RTD fares easier to use. RTD should work toward identifying
more non-fare sources of revenue, with the goal of eventually making the entire system fare-free.
Regarding the RTD LiVE Income Based Discount Program. I am pleased that this program is available
as it covers a large demographic not previously available with other discount fare programs. I'm
looking forward to proposed enhancements possibly coming in the future to LiVE. One feedback I
would like to give is for the reloadable MyRide card for the LiVE program. This is a great option for
many people that are unable to use the MyRide mobile ticketing app. either because they do not have
access to a mobile phone, on-line options and do not have or cannot obtain a debit or credit card to
use for payment and need to use cash. The MyRide card is a good alternative however it can only be
reloaded at an RTD Sales Outlet which severely limits their ability to reload the card as there are only
a few locations available to do this. Their needs to be more access available for people in the
community that must use cash to reload their cards. Grocery stores or convenience stores would be a
good option for these folks. Thanks for all you do with the discount fare programs.

Appreciate the simplicity of the new fee structure and commitment to accessibility for all riders. Well
done and thank you!
This is a great step in the right direction but does not go far enough with the airport fare. If you travel
with one other person it is likely to be the same price to Uber vs taking the train. The airport train
should be THE way to get to and from but if it costs $10 per person people will remain opposed to
using it. The barrier to entry is barely too high. Including it in the monthly pass is a great addition,
however. I do very much appreciate the combination of local and regional into a lower price. This
makes it much simpler to use!
I think they're a lot of work to be done in outreach letting people know about the discounts offered. I
like the idea of grocery stores, food banks and libraries having info and retail options for purchasing
these passes. They should have big obvious signs talking about the discount programs and how you
can buy tickets and passes there. Also the app needs a lot of work. There should be accurate location
data on the busses and trains whereabouts, how early or late they are so they can provide riders with
accurate ETAs. I can't rely on the busses downtown to be in time so that I can make my connection. I
missed two connections today and was late to work! That's not my fault but it looks like a terrible
excuse to my employer! Please address the timeliness of busses, they either arrive late or leave too
early, I've experienced both situations and it's ridiculous. The operators need to stick to a strict
schedule for the rider's sake!
Hi, I want to voice my support for the reduced cost of fares and passes, free fare for youths, and the
expansion of the LIVE discount. I think these changes are a great start to changing car dependence in
Denver and a step in the right direction for reducing greenhouse gases. This seems to be one of the
first real actions I've seen that can reduce emissions and I want to applaud the proposed changes and
people making it happen. I think this will increase ridership and make transit an option for more
people and for families that want to use transit. Lowering fares is a great way to encourage more
people to get out of their single occupant vehicles and use transit. I've used RTD buses and rail for 10
years and have seen a wide variety of people and interactions. I have never felt threatened or fearful
using transit unlike the feelings I get when driving with so many aggressive, arrogant, careless motor
vehicle operators. We need systemic change to dismantle car dependency and violence and this is a
great step. Thanks and keep up the good work on increasing transit use and decreasing carbon
emissions.
My husband and I are in our seventies and so appreciate that we are close to the light rail and buses.
We don’t have to pay to park and most of the places we visit are within walking distance. Thanks.
This new fare structure seems very equitable and smart. I think it will have almost only positive
impacts. Thank you
As a member of a group that advocates for the unsheltered and under-served, this program would
mean a lot to our clients. It would make it possible to avoid fines, keep their things, get medical help,
visit shelters and food banks, and find housing and jobs. It would help to remove some of the unfair
burden carried by those who suffer in poverty. Changing the fare structure to reflect equity is not only
going to increase paid ridership, it is a moral responsibility to our most vulnerable.
Very much look forward to these changes! It’s far too expensive for airport employees to use transit
to the airport! Also, please work with the airlines to get passes offered to their employees at no-cost
to the employee!

I attended the May 16th Zoom meeting, and I don't think I received a thoughtful or serious answer to
my question - which was intended to be constructive. Someone else in the chat asked about the base
fare being $2.75 rather than an even $3.00. I wanted to explore how RTD's current fare collection
equipment could replicate what other systems do (MBTA, RFTA?) by printing a stored-value card that
could be used on a future ride. I asked what it would take for the bus printers to print something
other than transfers. The answer I received was essentially "the bus printers print three-hour passes
and day passes," and "our system can't do what you're asking." My apologies for using informal
terminology that people who ride your buses would use ("transfers") instead of terminology used by
people who work at 1660 Blake St. The answers I received didn't seem to have received much thought
from the staff member who answered. At a minimum, I would have expected a reply such as "we'd
need someone from our IT department or our fare media vendor to discuss that, and unfortunately,
they're not here at this meeting." Instead I got a message that "The host has removed you from the
web meeting" at the end of the hour - before this and another question of mine was answered.
I never received an answer to this question during the May 16 noon webinar: Regarding other agency
policies, such as Portland Tri-Met's option of a diversion by applying for the analog of RTD's LiVE
program as restitution for fare evasion (that is, instead of paying a fine or performing community
service - see https://trimet.org/fares/fareisfair.htm ), would this possibility need to be considered as
part of the Fare Equity Study or the separate Respect the Ride effort? I hope that since I wasn't able
to get an answer during the webinar that this topic can be covered in the study's final
recommendations.
Needs to be more affordable
I work as the homeless student liaison at a charter school. I was very excited to see a No-cost transit
for youth ages 19 and under. This will help so many students - low income and homeless.
Transportation to school is one of the barriers so many homeless students experience. By providing
transportation, RTD has increased students' ability to achieve their and their family's goal of
graduating. Thank you!
Currently Access-A-Ride customers may ride regular services for free. Will this continue?
I would like to advocate that McKinney-Vento Homeless students and families be categorically
exempt from income verification for the LiVE program and that school districts be allowed to be an
organizational partner where we can purchase bulk LiVE passes for this specific population. PEAK is a
barrier for our students and families. Please make LiVE passes available for purchase just like Local 10
Ride Ticket Books. Thank you!

I LOVE the idea of making RTD free for youth. Adolescents are seeking independence and need access
to mobility in order to transition into adulthood. Making this fare free would increase access to
school choice, promote access to after-school activities, and give teens the independence they are
craving and need to develop a healthy sense of self-sufficiency and self-agency.
This comment is unrelated to the changes to fares, etc. But this issue is much more important than
any of that. I used to be a daily rider of RTD. Due to increasing crime, mostly damage to cars at the
park-n-rides & the transients at Union Station, I (and my family) no longer use RTD. I used to be a big
proponent of RTD, defending the funding, tax increases, etc. I will no longer support RTD until you
take the crime problem seriously, and work with police to apprehend and convict all criminal activity
surrounding RTD properties.
I encourage you to adopt the new fare structure, especially the recommended discount fare structure
for people over 65, Medicare recipients and those with disabilities. It will make a huge impact in their

How would new fare structure affect Access-a-ride when I have to plan to tell Access-a-ride I need to
be at my dr appointments at least an hour an hour and a half before my actual appt so I am not late.
Will Access-a-ride passengers be given a day trip for as many trips as they can make for that day fee.
All fares should be free for people over 70 years old.
LOVE! The new fare structure, It is a huge improvement. I am hoping we can continue to adjust the
price to drive increased ridership! Also hoping soon we can support nfc on iphones through apple
transit passes, would increase my ridership!
I believe the proposed plan would be good. It would make it easier and more affordable and by being
a disabled vet it would help out.
I feel that youth shoulde have free fares in order to attend school
All of these are a good idea.
I am so very excited about the new fare structure. I will definitely be riding the train and bus more
often once it is live. I absolutely think that the three pairs for all you should be extended beyond the
one-year pilot program. We need long-term investment in our youth and public transit. It is also kind
of strange to have bus fares be $1.35 because people don’t often Carey coins anymore. They should
definitely be rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
When I travel a single person j will take the bus/light rail to the airport. When it’s 2 or more of us
traveling to airport it is cheaper to pay for parking at dia vs round trip rail ($40 for 2 ppl) $30 for
parking.
Getting around with the bus is a really fun experience and this free for June thing for buses will really
help when I get to work and school
I think that we should have better bus stops and make bus stops easier to be at because having to
stand in the rain trying to get to school
These changes are ESSENTIAL for the people of Denver in providing public transportation for all! As a
bus rider myself the monthly pass decrease would be a game changer for me and allow me to access
more places that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to.
Location of transit is not convenient. Makes many last mile problems
We appreciate the current 70% discount off of full fares that youth currently receive. We purchase
10-pack ticket books for our kids to use when they ride the bus. However, sometimes they don't
anticipate needing to get home on their own and forget to bring their tickets when they are out.
Having a zero-fare program for youth would allow my kids to access public transportation whenever
they need it, rather than rely on a parent to pick them up in a car.
I'm an infrequent rider and will benefit hugely from these changes. Currently the monthly fare is
inaccessible to me and the new one would be affordable.
Can you please work with DIA to provide a discount for airport employees? The a.m. trains are FULL of
us & even with this proposed reduction, this is still a lot of $. I wanted to take the train daily to help
the environment, but it’s unfortunately cheaper for me to drive. Thank you!
I would be pleased if the monthly regional pass was reduced to 88$. One low price, one time
purchase would make my life convenient. I know several who would take the triai to DIA but
complain that the price is too high. I think ridership would increase with the new airport fare.
Thanks!
I'm very excited to see this simplified fare structure. Living in a local zone along a regional route, I
have previously been dinged by that change in fare. we need simplicity in our system to better
encourage more transit users. I'm also pleased to see more consistency amongst the discount fares as

The cheaper regional fare is the best part.
It should be free for homeless people or people with no money. I also hope you don't cut the routes.
I like that the regional and local day pass is less because I have to go to Longmont to work.
I hope you all still make money. It's nice that you're giving us a break.
Glad it is going to cost less money. My issue is the drivers kick me off if I don't have exact change. I
think the $2.75 will make the same problem for me and lots of others.
The bus should be free for local rides
I like the cheaper local fare but I hope the drivers will have change so they don't take an extra quarter
when I ride the bus.
I like these new fares because the monthly fare is less.
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth
pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. Additionally, see the success of the free fare programming both here in Denver/August,
and in other cities. I'm a firm advocate of making RTD fares completely free. It reflects the accurate
value system of our community members who rely most on these services, greener/cleaner/lower
congestion on our streets, and eliminates ALL of the cost and accountability of collecting fares at all.
Imagine how streamlined a system we could have if drivers were not at all concerned about collecting
fares, we didn't have to have officers screening for non-payment and risk unhealthy encounters, no
systems or procedures would need to be in place, screened, trained, reviewed, reciprocated in
accountability, etc. It would simply save more money than it brings in to charge $0 for all transit. I
urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state
funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward affordability and equity to make our
transit system accessible for all. Thank you.
The fare structure looks more affordable and should allow more people to be able to access the rtd
services
I think it makes sense to not have a higher fee for those in lower cost of living areas (generally further
out) so mass transit is used more. I’m not sure I would lower the local fare though. Why not just leave
it the same? $3 (for 3 hrs) & $6 (for day) to have a slightly lower tax burden & “even” $ amounts.
Otherwise I like the ideas. Thanks!
Agree only if this change won’t affect the quality of the service. Right now is good. Keep it that way
I think that the new recommended fares are a great improvement. I have been using the RTD college
pass for a couple of years, but now that I'm graduating and losing access to that I have been trying to
figure out how to make my commute. The current monthly pass is far to expensive to justify purchase
for me but at a price point of $88 its far more reasonable and I would be more than likely to continue
to utilize RTD services for commutes. Thank you for taking the time to do this study and for the
potential of making RTD affordable for everyone! Best regards, Taylor Mundt

The Fee structure is still outrageous. I've been to dozens of other countries around the world and
these fares are laughable. If we want to move to mass transit, the costs need to be lower. Period.
Wake up.
The new fee structure appears more affordable for those groups of riders who actually depend on
public transportation. I especially believe that the reduce cost for regional and airport fares will
benefit the metro area as a whole with regard to reduced traffic and air pollution.
Riders 65 or older should ride free. They've paid RTD taxes for decades. Gets them off the road and
decarbonized too. Children should pay something. Teaches them that transportation costs $$$ and
isn't free. They learn the sting of paying taxes for RTD services. RTD must first ensure a safe, clean,
vagrant free riding experience before customers will return. RTD light rail is a fixed guideway system
designed to move passengers toward the center city. This is now an obsolete concept. Neighborhood
circulator buses should be stationed at each light rail stop to better service the local neighborhoods
rather than the central city. A once to twice per hour express light rail train should service the
downtown. This will require dispatching capabilities far above what RTD currently has. RTD
management needs reengineered. Far too many chiefs with far too few Indians, especially beat cops.
18 RTD Board members is ridiculous.
Please clean up your bus stop trash. Lafayette at Lucerne and Hwy 287 is piling up and blowing trash
all over Lafayette. Bad environmental impact by RTD.
I support the new fare structure. I would also support having someone check fares. I think those of
us that pay them are subsidizing a lot of riders who don't.
Why is the CEO salary so high?
I would like to see a monthly pass available to LiVE participants. Being on SNAP and unemployed I am
constantly on the bus all over the district for interviews and job searches.
I’m reviewing the new fare schedule there is no option for veteran discounts. As a disabled veteran
who requires the RTD A and R lines to make appointments at the hospital etc. I have to prove
disability. This is fine however I choose not to file for state disability, my injuries are a result of federal
service and only use Veterans Affairs for medical and disability. Currently RTD requires state disability
forms for disability discounts. My choice to “save money in the state pot” for others to use
automatically puts me in tougher financial positions and I receive no disability assistance on Bus/Rail
options. I have on numerous occasions, going back to 2020, been harassed by RTD security staff
because “I don’t look disabled.” My apologies RTD that disabilities are not appearance based as the
Americans with disabilities act would agree. RTD’s managerial incompetency is being taken out on
paying customers, shocking RTD can’t seem to make the correlation from their actions and policies
and the drop in ridership. This includes employee conduct. Just a former new flyer transit operator
from Virginia with 3 years of observation now on RTD and well, I still wait for the ability to applaud
RTD for doing something correct, observations and easily heard comments from riders show that
Denver will not have reliable public transportation anytime this decade at the current pace and with
the leadership in place. Union Station (train areas) also appalling. The urine rich aroma of public
transportation in Paris, is still far cleaner than the RTD and it’s well known those aren’t water puddles.
RTD is the problem, public transport is meant to be a solution, perhaps new leadership with European
and or real world experience is necessary. With road rage accidents on the rise, this is the time to
shine for public transport, not continue to circle the drain down the toilet. Hopefully RTD can make
positive changes, in less than 10+ years, my optimism remains low.
Please continue the EcoPass program. It has pushed me to use RTD more consistently and to get more
cars off the road. It is a great program for companies/organizations that buy into it. I am a BVSD
employee and get the EcoPass through BVSD. I love it and wish it was also available for my family. The
new fare structures look reasonable (especially the free youth option), but the EcoPass needs to
continue as well. Thank you.

I live within a very short walk to 10th & Osage and work a very short walk from Orchard. I chose this
job and house due to proximity to RTD. I never take it though as I feel uneasy at the 10th & Osage
station with all the vagrants hanging by the grassy slope. And the zone fare is just too expensive to
justify. Yes we can afford it, but there comes a point where it just doesn't make sense. There should
be a charge, just not so cost prohibitive for those who do not get subsidized. But enough of a cost to
keep the vagrants from taking up all the space. Also need to step up security. Drugs are out of hand.
Another huge disappointment is the RTD after a Fiddlers Green event. We gave up on that year's ago.
Always worried that we wouldn't fit on the one last train that runs when the show lets out. And way
too long of a wait time to catch that last train. They should be a few trains ready to go when big
events let out. I hope you can get us back as customers, we've been so disappointed by the whole
system...
Kids zero fair would allow more to ride it. I can’t afford it with the kids and myself
Love the new structure! Feels much simpler for first time or out-of-town users.
Simplify the tickets by allowing/limiting rides by time-of-use, not Regions crossed. Riders taking the D
train from Littleton-Mineral have a total of ONE stop that's in their "Local" region. Riders taking the W
train, from JeffCo Govt's Cntr-Golden have ZERO stops in their "Local region. Riders taking the E and
R trains, from RidgeGate Pkwy, in contrast, have NUMEROUS stops, before hitting a new region. This
makes no sense and financially burdens/punishes riders, based on where they live.
Fare should be free and frequent. RTD is a PUBLIC SERVICE that should be fully funded through taxes
and grants. I moved into a house because of its proximity to the light rail six years ago and took the
light rail downtown. Then the (already more expensive than driving) price went up, then trek of the
three stops I used got cut and frequency decreased, then the price went up again, then violent
policing increased (of POC and of queer people like myself), then the frequency decreased again, and
now I drive downtown every day, sometimes multiple times a day, because I can’t afford to burn time
or money trying and won’t risk state sponsored harassment to support a public services that has done
everything it can to convince the public not to use it. I’m hoping the Lynx BRT will help with reliability
but if it costs $6-$19 (not sure which fare level it will be for that distance) for me to take it to my
favorite brewery in Aurora, I’ll just keep taking a car.
In the last years Arapahoe Ridge HS have been supporting our student with RTD bus passes in order
for our students to come to school and to go to work. RTD can support our students and facilitate
them with their most important need which happens to be transportation. Lack of transportation is
the biggest reason for missing attendance, by helping the students with RTD tickets, we can reduce
this problem by 90%. Most of our students come from families that are going through financial
hardship that cannot afford transportation. By helping them with this, they can now go to school and
start their path to success.
My school has been working under a grant for the past two years to provide bussing for students to
attend ARHS. We also offer credit to students for working in the community. What we have found is
that students do not have transportation to and from work. FREE to STUDENTS is an excellent way to
support the working class of Boulder. 70% of my school is free and reduced lunch. The families
support education but don't have the means to get their students to school. This proposal would be a
DREAM COME TRUE for families of poverty in Boulder County.
After reviewing the recommended fare structure, I am in favor. As an infrequent rider, I was
frequently confused as to which fare I needed to purchase. Combining local and regional makes
sense. I appreciate the lower fee structure. Price to ride was not an issue for me; however, I'm sure
that will be welcome by transit reliant/financially burdened customers. I'm wondering how this will
be subsidized.

1) I really want to ride and support public transportation but the price and time to drive is still much
better. The price is going to have to lower much more than 25 cents to get my family on public more
often. 2) Would it be possible to up the amount of hour for a pass from 3 to 4? That would also get
me on public more often and make it possible to use just one ticket to go to an event for example.
3) Or how about a bigger discount than 10% for 10 pack tickets? 4) I have a gap year program with
numerous young people that use RTD. They all usually take the same bus but they all can't ride their
bikes b/c only two bikes fit on the rack and can't be brought on bus. This really limits us!
We deem that this initiative would be undoubtedly equitable for students in our district, specifically
those undergoing housing challenges, who are qualified to receive McKinney Vento Services. This
school year we've had our highest number ever of unhoused families at BVSD.

I’m particularly happy that RTD is simplifying the structure and creating significant cost savings for the

Free fares for those under 19 is a great step toward improving attendance for public school students.
Transportation cost should not be a barrier for accessing a free, appropriate, public education.
I live on a light rail stop and never use it because it is too expensive. I used it once this year and the
train I planned to take home was cancelled, so I had to call a ride share car. I also used to work near
another lightrail stop on the other end of the city three days a week. It still was too expensive and
didn't make sense to use. The stop I live on is also in a different zone and so, last I checked, it is more
expensive to use the one here than to drive a short distance to another one that is just as far south. I
use it less than once a year.
I love that 19 and younger are free. I think the fare structure should be $3, $6, and $90.
Way to go RTD on the proposal to make fares reasonably priced for all, create a program for all youth
under 19 to hop on transit, and making the LIVE monthly program more affordable and less
cumbersome. As a city planner and lover/supporter of transit, my main question is how RTD will
sustain funding for the fare cost reductions...with the assumption that more people will ride?
This is an excellent idea to create a more accessible, inclusive public transit system in Denver,
specifically for those who require it for daily commuting. Personally, this would encourage me to use
it more and also make it more feasible to get to the airport.
I agree with the proposed changes. This would simplify my life and make the community more
accessible to all parties.
I was very happy to see RTD proposing a reduction in fare prices. When I moved to the metro area, I
was eager to make more use of public transit for convenience, savings, and the environment. But I
was shocked to see the high prices of both rail *and* bus services. How is RTD meant to encourage
public transit use and the reduction of smog and congestion when it is *cheaper* to drive, even with
the summer’s high gas prices? My 20 mile round-trip commute costs around $3-3.50 in gas; even with
the added cost of insurance and car maintenance, it seems to barely match the $6 round-trip bus
fare, which is significantly less convenient. I have lived in metro areas where bus transit is significantly
cheaper than RTD or even free. I am glad for RTD’s lower fares, and hope they will be further lowered.
I also would like to see greater transparency in why the fares are so high compared to other metro
areas—or if in fact this is not the case.

I'm so glad to hear that the access for Youth will improve. Too many times growing up in Houston I
was unable to participate in educational, volunteer or work opportunities. Our youth, especially our
economically disadvantaged youth, deserve access and I'm so proud to live in a state, and city that
cares.
$3.00 is expensive compared to other cities across the US. I suggest if we keep the $3.00, make that a
full day pass so riders can complete a number of errands rather than just have the 3 hour window.
I support new reduced rates (which are still higher than pre-COVID fares). Transit in the metro area is
expensive.
I agree to lower the RTD fare for all people in this community.
Look forward to lower fares
Make fares cheaper and more affordable for all! And a place to call security or cops from unruly
people in the bus
RTD should be free. The current price is ridiculous and unfair for the people that rely on it for daily
transportation. The city should spend less resources for car infrastructure and put more into public
transportation and infrastructure.
I really like the proposed changes! I especially like the Zero Fare for Youth program and the lower
monthly pass cost.
I am very pleased with RTD's new fare structure, especially the lower fares for monthly passes,
simplified discount categories, and free fares for younger people. I would like to see RTD work
actively to secure funds from the state.
I appreciate the simplified fare structure and lower fares. Nice job! I hope your efforts will get a few
more people out of their cars.
$1.00 should be the fare for all rides.
I think the Airport fee should be lower so that a family can take the train for cheaper than paying to
park at the airport.
I fully support the new changes in recommended fare structure and how it would greatly benefit
lower income, disabled, marginalized, and unhoused populations that lack access to transportation.
This would particularly allow the people we serve in our organization easier access to resources such
as appointments, food banks, work, etc. that are so crucial to supporting them in the community.
Most times I ride the AB bus to and from DIA there are no enough seats for all the passengers. People
stand for 40 minutes while on a bus going over 60 mph on a highway. This is so unsafe. Why does rtd

I like the new fare structure. Lower prices should help get more riders, and it is definitely a good idea
to lower the cost of the monthly pass.
I'm thrilled to see the $88 monthly pass fee for the Regional routes and the streamlining of the pricing
structure. I ride RTD frequently and even I'm confused about how the current fare structure works. I
never know when I get on the buses headed out of Denver if I'm going to be paying $3 or $5.25.
Since "troublemakers" and the homeless are now allowed to ride free (drivers tell me they're not
supposed to confront anyone or refuse them a seat), upstanding citizens should have the fare waived
as well.
The one thing I see missing is an annual fare . Businesses can pay as little as $350/yr for a commuter
pass, but individuals it’s closer to $3k. It will be better if you buy 12 monthly passes at $88/mo, but
what about just having an annual pass with a discount? It would save in monthly administrative costs
and benefit riders whose companies don’t purchase passes.
Free fare. You have tried everything else and it doesn't work Take a look at Luxembourg with their

glad to see that RTD is taking the time to hear the public on what can be improved. I also enjoy taking
my kid on the bus to museums, events, etc., but it can be an added complication when I need to
figure out the cost, exact change, etc. (I use the mobile app, but my kid doesn't have one). We would
definitely use the bus and train more to explore the city and get to and from the airport with free
fares for youth. I urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as possible, and keep
pushing for state funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward affordability and

Hello there! I wanted to express my feelings about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and pass
structure. I am delighted that RTD is planning to simplify the structure and reduce costs for all riders,
with a special focus on frequent riders who can benefit from the monthly pass. Additionally, I am
excited about the upcoming free fares for youth pilot program and the consolidation of the discount
programs into one. I’m concerned about a few barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end
up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove some of the requirements to qualify for
discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need transit accessibility the most. I’d also like
RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares for youth program. These changes would
make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I know these require increased funding, and I
urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these changes. I’d love to know if RTD studied
moving the 3-hour fare to $2 and if not, encourage you to do so. It’s an exact change and could drive
ridership up. The lower the barrier to riding for cash customers, the better. Having 10 people paying
$2.75, is one thing. Getting 30-35 at $2.00 would be a major win money-wise. Busses are running
regardless, why not make sure they’re always more than half full? Not to mention, the lack of giving
change, really means the fare is $3 for cash customers. I urge you to adopt these changes,
implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare
and pass structure toward affordability and equity to make our transit system accessible for all.
Thank you
Greetings RTD Team ~ I’m writing to share my comments about the proposed changes to the RTD
fare and pass structure. I’m VERY grateful RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all
riders (especially those that depend on RTD as their primary form of transportation). I really like
seeing the free fares for youth pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one.
I would; however, love to see the 3-hour passes be $2 even (instead of $2.75). I have taken numerous
transit/bus routes where the fee was only $2. This makes everything easier, smoother, and less
stressful - on drivers, on riders, on those who one any number of edges financially - running late - in
challenging weather. I am grateful for the work around providing grants/discounts for community
serving organizations. I would recommend that this is as easy as possible for said
organizations/leaders. I would also recommend that there are perks/incentives for these leaders to
educate, connect, and promote transit ridership. In addition to making permanent free fares for
youth, I would love to see more advocacy from RTD - publicly and politically - around safe and
accessible ACCESS to bus stops/stations. I would also love to see creative fundraising
schemes/programs to invite community to help privately fund (or partially/privately fund) bus stop
shelters - with local artists, ADA codes, and support from RTD and city/county agencies. These
changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. As a full-time pedestrian
and transit user, we need our system to radically CENTER access/dignity for those who depend on
these systems the most, programs/organizing around climate action responsibility and transit, and
community partners/agencies who can help expand funding, increase ridership, and shift
harmful/false stigmas around transit. In gratitude, Jonathon

Lowering the fares will be SUPER helpful in convincing (new) folks to take public transit, as well as
helping those who already struggle to afford it. I don't have a car and have relied on RTD since I
moved to Denver in 2018, and I am thrilled to see these changes and updates. I am a graduate
student at the University of Denver, and I love the student pass I receive through DU's bulk policy with
RTD. As an aside, the #1 change that would improve the overall quality of taking RTD is *frequency*
of buses. I know this is dependent on employing more drivers, but it would DRASTICALLY improve the
ease of taking transit. Thank you!
I make decent money and recently purchased a condo in Denver. I'm doing okay. Public transit here
isn't affordable. For a family of 4 to go to the airport and back is $80. I can park and drive and feel
very safe for LESS! The bus to Boulder, more expensive than driving unless you are a student. You
need to general middle class to use the transit to subsidize all the other people using it but it's not a
deal. It sometime MORE than driving. There is NO motivator to use the public transit besides
traveling to the airport solo. I don't use it any other time because it is not affordable. If it was $3 per
person I would exclusively use it to go to and from the airport. A dollar saved is a dollar made. I'm
over paying a lot for a poor service. Make it a fair affordable price and we will come use it all the time.
Until then, I'll be driving and parking.
We work with arts workers all over the metro area who use buses and light rail as well as those who
wish they could use it but currently can’t. Schedules don’t go as late as they could, service is
unreliable and currently unsafe on multiple routes, and prices, especially to the airport, have been
cost prohibitive given the available routes and timed schedules. A more integrated system that
benefits performing arts workers that work long hours in the night and in multiple areas is paramount
for this group to be regular RTD riders.
we should make all fares minimal to encourage the public to use ALL available forms of public transit.
The only way to get cars off the roads - and provide transportation alternatives is to have a lot of
frequent options. This means smaller vehicles (i.e. 15 passenger vans) and more frequent stops
throughout towns and cities. Large Empty Buses are a waste of taxpayer resources. Side Note when is the commuter rail coming to Boulder? We have waited a decade with no progress. Time for
Eminent Domain - or a major investment - or return our money!
Make sure to have markedly lower fares for low income/elderly/disabled, thank you!
I think the fare structure should be changed. It is almost as expensive as owning a car for the current
daily rider.
I think this is an excellent idea that will get more people to use the bus and increase revenue through
volume.
Public transit should be viewed as part of infrastructure like roads and city parks and should be
heavily subsidized for everyone. Rich people will still drive their Mercedes to work, don’t worry. You
want people to use it and not have to keep expanding highways - then stop spending money on
highways and put it into public transit subsidies. Look at countries where it’s done successfully. Asking
people to show they are poor enough to get a discount and to track all that will require so much work
that it won’t be worth it. Stop trying to make it fair, make it WORK. Make people love it and depend
on it - and then people will be willing to pay more for the convenience.
Follow CTA -Chicago Transit Authority’s pricing model!
I think the fare needs to be cheaper than it is to park downtown. We almost rode today but it would
have cost my husband and me $6 each, totaling $12. On SpotHero, I found parking for $10. We chose
to drive instead since it was cheaper. Also, some of the RTD light rail lots require you to pay to park.
All parking should be free since we’re paying to use the light rail. In sum, it’s often cheaper for the 2
of us to park downtown than it is to use public transportation.

I ride the bus in Seattle as a senior citizen. The reduced fare is $1 each trip including the express bus
to the airport. If you really want ridership among the elderly, the fee of $1 should be effect for us. In
addition, the flex rides should be available late nights and on the weekends as well. It is too
expensive for UBR from the airport. Also, I ride the AT bus to Arapahoe. When my flight is later than
11:17 PM, the bus does not go to Arapahoe station. It is a 5 mile walk, so I sleep at the airport until
the 6:17AM bus. Thanks this forum to discuss fare and improvements.
As a student, this would be super helpful to me and other students who struggle with other
transportation!
Current Price too high. Proposed one looks great Dirty seats. Please replace
This fare structure is such a huge step in the right direction. Much simpler, and more in line with the
cost of transit in other comparable cities. (Public transit should be free, though). I’m hoping there’s a
way to do some kind of pay as you go for a monthly pass, so riders who don’t have the $ upfront for a
pass don’t end up paying more than those of us with more liquidity.
Love it!!!! Finally, it will cost me less to ride the train from Broadway to Lone Tree than to drive to
work!!!! Thank you!!!!! I love the light rail. And the airport fare is still reasonable. Also given the
dangers with speed and what happened on the golden line, I recommend using cameras and speed
monitors so engineers will be watched and not be permitted to travel at excessive speeds. The cost
of Monitoring public safety on transit, a basic obligation of RTD, will more than cover the expense the
city will incur as a result of the recent unfortunate accident, increase public trust, protect riders, and
increase ridership.
I live in North Denver and go to the Tech Center. Here are reasons why I don't: 1) Union Station is full
of bums! Why on earth would I want to pass thru? 2) The light rail is SLOW. I can get by car just as
fast even in heavy rush hour traffic. 3) The fare isn't worth it if I had to do this weekly. You're asking
me to pay $200 a month when it costs the same in gas for a compact car? 4) Very few creature
comforts, food/drink services along line. I would love to use mass transit, but it makes no economic
sense, hard to use and feels unsafe.
free fare for people 19 and under
Make all public transportation free.
I think It would benefit the public, and it would be awesome for the environment
Absolutely love the lower fare idea! RTD is solid for what it does and staff are always friendly!
Make public transit free for all.
I pay 200 a month for transportation to and from work and it gets expensive in the months I don't use
it to it's full capacity
One of the reasons I don't often use the light rail when I can is because of the outrageous prices. It's
handy to jump on a train to Park Meadows but cheaper to drive when traveling with a family of 4. It's
well over $30 bucks round trip for all of us. It is senseless to have such high fairs per person- it's a
deterrent to riding RTD. If your goal is to make money it shouldn't be off the limited people who will
ride. Lower the prices to affordable prices, that makes it cheaper than driving a car, and more people
will take advantage of it, hence RTD will bring in more money. The light rail to the airport is ridiculous.
We want to take it but for a family of 4 it is $80 round trip. No we'll just get a ride to and from. Also
get some security on each lightrail/ bus. They're are people who harass and bully others on the bus.
It isn't safe.
I realize you are in a "catch 22", but you have increased fares and decreased service. If you had
service that ran more often I would be more inclined to take the bus. The senior discount is good for
me, as I am a senior. Riding light rail is confusing because of the fair scale for longer trips, because I
am not sure what zone I'm in when I get on or off.
Please lower the cost!

Totally agree with Free Youth fares!
I'm very onboard with these changes, but would like to see further reduction in the regular fare as
well. RTD is one of the most expensive transit in the country, and it affects ridership. For example, we
went to a Rockies game with family and friends the other day, and we would have loved to take the
bus. But it was the same price for four adults to drive and park downtown as it would have been for
us to take the bus. That seems backwards.
Please make the A Line route to the airport either free or significantly more affordable. Incent people
to use it rather than it being an easier/cheaper option to drive and park at one of the outer lots or
take a taxi or rideshare. It's $40 for two people to take a round trip A Line ride to the airport, that's
likely why it's underutilized.
The most important thing for the success of the system is high numbers of riders which can only be
achieved through frequent service along routes connecting areas of interest. Please do not reduce
fees too much or move to a free fare model which would undermine the ability of the system to
operate with enough service to make it a viable alternative to driving.
I visited Seattle and their senior fare for either light rail or bus is $1, period, no matter how long your
trip.
Public transit should be free.
I agree with under 19 ride free. Provide the next generation with a love for mass/community transit.
I agree with expanding employer sponsored passes. This is the best way to do ridership outreach for
commuters. Give a tax inventive for the businesses. Time based passes were a welcome change.
Enable NFC pass scanning for phones. Create a family pass for getting to the airport. Simple flat rate
for groups traveling to/from the airport. It has to be less expensive than driving plus the cheapest
parking option at the airport.
I am writing to express my support for the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare
Study. The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders and will offer some incredibly
good value journeys on RTD such as Denver to Boulder. In addition, the proposed $88 monthly fare
cap / pass will offer anybody who uses RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who
work at Denver Airport. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply
discounted monthly fare caps / passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare
recipients and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a
huge benefit to the districts’ high school students.
It would be good to explain more how this fare structure would work for families. I initially was
thinking it would cost $50 to bring a family of 5 to the airport on the A line which isn't competitive
with driving or Lyft/Uber. However, after spending some time reading the policies and programs
section it sounds like children under 5 ride free and other ages receive a substantial discount. This
was news to me. Advertising these price reductions for children would be good as my family and
other families I've talked with in the metro area weren't aware of them and thus didn't consider RTD
as a serious option for getting around. Overall, I think the fare structure is a huge improvement
over the previous one. It greatly simplifies fare calculus and bringing the monthly pass under $100
while including the airport is quite attractive.
I would like the bus fare to be free for all people under 19 because it would help me get to and from
school without worrying if I need money for the bus.
Something that I've never heard discussed is incentivizing loyal RTD customers. Reward those who
take RTD regularly, offer promotional pricing for NEW customers that sign up, give free passes for
out-of-town family & guests. The goal is to get people out of their cars and lowering the cost of a ride
by a quarter doesn't do that. Allow people to earn points to get a free monthly pass. Those savings
could mean a lot to people.

Make fares free for youths
Having free bus passes monthly for students in Denver public schools as well as for Auraria campus
students would be extremely beneficial and help make transportation as well as education more
equitable.
I'm very much in favor of free fares for people 19 and under. I work at North High School and Skinner
Middle School Especially at North, MANY of our students ride the bus to school each day. We offer
discounted bus passes, but free rides would make a huge difference to our students. I also think that
knowing the bus is always free would encourage young people to use RTD much more often.
Greetings: As a representative of the largest advocacy organization of the blind in Colorado, I want
to say at the outset that the manner in which the recommended fare structure is being presented is
incredibly difficult to read because of the numerous links that a person must activate in order to glean
any useful information. We understand the recommendation would eliminate regional fares over-all,
both for full-fare and discount-fare customers. But saying that fares would be reduced by a certain
amount without indicating the final fare under the new structure makes it harder for the reader to
understand what is happening. Why not just say (for example) that for full-fare customers, the regular
fare would be reduced from $3 to $2.75 and that for discount customers, . the fare would be reduced
from $1.50 to $1.35. If, in fact, you have a single page which lays all of this out, I would be happy to
receive a file which we could share with our blind members, friends, and colleagues. Cordially,
Curtis Chong National Federation of the Blind of Colorado
As a middle school social worker in DPS, I am writing in STRONG support of the Youth fare proposal
for free transit pass for all youth 19 and under. Our high school students have historically been able
to access free bus passes in order to utilize RTD for transport to and from school and activities. We
have many middle school students, especially those with truancy issues, who's parents have
unreliable or no formal transporation of their own who are missing out on their education due to
accessibility due to lack of transportation and/or hardship financial impact on family even with
reduced youth fare. Having this RTD pass available to middle schoolers will provide the benefit of
allowing students to have agency in getting themselves to school without relying on an adult and to
gain skills in RTD ridership for their use in the future as a Denver resident. Please approve this option
as a means to increase equity for all students to be able to get themselves to and from school and
their outside activities that builds protective factors for youth.
I like the new proposed plan and would ride far more often with that fare structure for a monthly
pass.
I support the reduced fare proposal. I pay the monthly full fare every month as I commute from
Westminster to Downtown using the FF1 bus and the proposed reduced fares would have a huge
positive impact on my family’s budget.
I’m very excited for this updated fare structure. For me personally, it never made sense financially to
take public transit to my destinations due to the high cost. Now with these reductions, it’s going to
take me out of my car more often then not in the future. I do have a concern on the standard 3-hour
and daily rates. Because they are not even dollars, I do think it’ll make things difficult to those who
must pay with cash and if drivers don’t carry change, it’ll mean they are spending more to ride. I hope
you can find a reasonable solution to this, either by reducing the price or including some kind of
transit ticket where you can load cash into.
Ok
Due to the fact that Denver Public Schools does not provide school bus transportation for students, it
is critical that the Zero Fare for students under the age of 19. Please also consider route changes to

I work at the hospital and my husband at the airport... I think hospital employees and airport
employees should get some type of discount on monthly passes.
STOP shifting the burden of payment to others. To be equitable, everyone (regardless of color, creed,
etc.) should pay the same amount. RTD cannot afford to lower rates, especially when they need to
ENFORCE policy by stopping the non-paying riders. More-&-more I don't feel safe on RTD, and that
will cause more of us to STOP riding. Reduced fares, "equity" programs, and lack of enforcement in
trains will continue to make RTD go down-hill and lose customers.
Are you, or can you, bring back discounted coupon booklets?! I see a problem with feeding in three
dollar bills and expecting to get back 30 cents in change. And the ticket kiosks where I ride from
(Southmoor) has had one out-of-service since before Covid. I would much rather buy a ticket booklet

Fares should be less if I only need 1 ride down the road I spend $6 a day for 1 bus 2 ways
I am delighted that you are lowering fares. This is such a positive step to increase ridership. I admit I
was not well-versed in the equity issues involved, but am happy that this is being
addressed/publicized as well.
I support removing the regional fare and making the monthly pass much cheaper! Great work on this!
The airport fare is very expensive. $10+ per ticket is excessive. Especially, if you are only 2 stops
away from the airport. The airport train cost should be based on where you are going verse a flat
rate...like the other lines. Also, the bus from Union Station to Boulder is amazing. Could there be a
future train instead of the bus?
The buses need to be more clean there are some that are dirty
I think that the new lower fare for everyone and the one price local/regional are going to boost usage.
The zero fare for under 19 is going to bring rtd so much more business year round. This'll help create
jobs and make less emissions/smaller carbon footprint and working towards climate justice. I also like
the increased discount for LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount participants.
They should give more discount on the 1 month ticket a lot of people can’t afford to pay so much
money at once

Have you permanently closed the Downtown Boulder bus station? I live a block away and I've seen no

I am a social worker with Denver Public Schools and I am a huge proponent of the Zero Fare for Youth
Pilot. Anything we can do to reduce barriers for youth to attending school is so vital. I wonder if this
pilot can be tied to existing programs/structures such as the MyDenver Card or school ID cards. Thank
you for work on this and your efforts to engage the community.
So thankful that kids under 19 will be able to get the bus for free. I can see what a hardship even the
reduced fare/monthly pass has on my teen’s friends. Thank you for piloting this.
Age discrimination. That is a point that I would like to see considered. You plan to give one age group
free travel, and still expect everyone else to pay. So, for example, you have two friends board. One is
19, the other is 20. One of them has to pay and but the other gets to ride free. It makes no sense.
How hard is it to expect a youth to pay $0.90 or $1.80. If free for one, than it has to be free for all. A
good segway to the next point: Why have any fares at all if you do not plan to ever enforce it? It is
warning, after warning, after warning. But no actual consequences. "Educate and accommodate"
that's all I ever hear. How many times should someone be "educated" before there is any
ENFORCEMENT? There are laws for a reason. Use those laws to enforce fares. Or simply stop all fares
and go to a FULLY FREE system. It is not practical to have it both ways. It is not fair to not make
everyone or no one pay fares. It is not fair to single out one age group to be free and then expect
others to pay. It is not fair to expect people to pay, but yet not consequence those that do not pay.
Just get it over with and go to a fully free ride system. And then beef up police presence on the buses
and trains because free will attract crime, homeless camping, drug use, etc. The system still has not
recovered from 'free for covid' issues that continue to plague the transit system.
I used to love taking RTD before the pandemic. I am very leary of going back due to the increase in
crime. I hope this will be addressed.
The new fare structure is great and will help the region reach its equity, climate, and safety goals. Can
you provide more transparency online about how this will impact RTD's overall budget? My only
concern is that the loss in revenue will lead to additional service cuts, when what we need most right
now is more frequent service and extended service hours. Thank you.

The current price structure that RTD is using, penalizes individuals that are considering using public
transport. A couple looking to go downtown will spend upwards of 20$ on just transit with RTD. This
does not encourage public transit use.
Please, please deal with various riders who feel entitled to smoke or vape on the train or bus. It is
unfair to the non-smoking riders to observe the security guards also covertly vape on the train
platforms, and then they expect us to obey the rules they supposedly have the power to enforce. It
can be harmful when I need to step away from the smokers who need to puff up in billows of germy
smoke just before boarding.
I like and appreciate the lower pricing that is proposed for RTD Service. The price has been going up
and the quality has been going down of RTD Services: timeliness, cleanliness, safety, reliability etc.
Also, it didn’t make sense that it cost the same amount to go to Boulder as it does to go to the airport
from Denver. The price of $10.50 round trip for a trip that is more than 3 hours was not the most
logical, especially since 1 hour of that time is spent on the bus so the transfer would only be good for
2 hours. Also, I haven’t liked the zoning since I started using RTD over 10 years ago. It is difficult for
new riders to understand and makes traveling within the Boulder/Denver/Aurora metro area more
expensive and deters people from going outside of their zone.
The new fare structure makes the monthly fare something I would actually purchase. As a 4-5 day a
week user, the current local monthly fare doesn’t make any sense for me to use because if I go on a
trip, work from home an extra day, or need to drive to work for whatever reason, I end up spending
more than I would on local fare 10-packs. At an $88 flat rate for full use of the system, I’d buy that
every month. It also incentivizes me as a regular rider to take the train to the airport. As someone
who does not necessarily live close to the A-line, the cost of taking the A line+a cab to the station vs
driving to the airport is a wash. The next thing I hope to see is increased frequency of A line trains
and have increased frequency later into the night (or atleast on busy nights like sundays). As it
stands, transferring from light rail to the A-line adds 15 minutes to the already long trip to the airport
I think the change in the fare prices is a really good idea especially for those of us who use the bus on
a regular basis. The only thing that would be amazing is if Live offered a monthly pass. I think giving
youth a free monthly pass is a fabulous idea.
They should not let anyone come in the bus like homeless
RTD buses and light rail are already free for anyone who chooses not to pay.
They should lower the mond pass it it to much money to pay at once
They should lower the month pass so many people cant aford to buy The pass because it is to much
money
They should lower the price and have equil prices for al type of trasportacion
All older people should not have to pay to ride a bus
I take the A line daily to the airport for work and I think the monthly fare of $88.00 will help al lot of
us passengers especially people who need to take public transit to get to work daily.
For taking time to read the police’s and putting them in place
I think the new fare will benefit everyone across the community. I fully rely on RTD and I've been
utilizing RTD for 38 years since I was 15. I don't know how the discount programs work though so it
would be hard for me to help others apply in my community.
Move the airport fare to $11.50 but create a Colorado residents discount that lowers the fare to $5.00
for residents by entering their zip code and their drivers license/state ID number at the time of
purchase. The rider could make this part of their RTD app profile so that they don’t need to reenter it
over and over again. This system would have tourists subsidize the system while avoiding excessive
fares for residents who need to ride more frequently.

I hope the fares can be reduced or removed entirely for the people of Colorado. Having better access
and more realiable public transportation will benefit everyone in the long run.
I fully support the new fare structure. This is very similar to the fare structure that was in place when I
was living in Chicago. It made the system easy to understand and easy to navigate and was a big
reason why I felt happy relying on public transport throughout the entire time I lived in that city.
Upon moving to Denver, I thought the RTD fair structure was confusing and priced too high for what
the system offered. At the time I worked at the airport and ultimately I had to resort to driving,
because it made more economical sense.
This is a step in the right direction for the RTD and access to regional transit will benefit from this. I
personally do not currently use this service because of the cost, I commute to Boulder and the price
for bus fare is about the same as driving without the convenience. If this new structure is
implemented, there is more of a benefit to me personally in using public transit (along with less
impact on the environment, traffic, etc.). I imagine I'm not alone in my reasoning and that ridership
will increase, justifying more investment in the system from the state. This is a good thing for
everyone!
Until you make good on the NW Rail, I consider you as nothing more than a group of thieves.
I think it's a good idea to have both the local and regional fares combined into one price. It's time
consuming having to check the schedules just to see which buses are local and regional. I remember
sometime last year, I emailed a RTD representative about what pass I have to buy to get to work. I
was told local, but it turns out that I needed the regional pass. The two different prices for local and
regional is so confusing that even customer service cannot figure it out. Please combine it into one
price.
Cut the cost of fares and you will see more people use the trains. = more $
Please pass this and the current structure is confusing and pricey for those of that don't drive
I applaud RTD for the changes in fare collection. The new fare structure will make transit easier to
use and more accessible to folks on limited income. The new monthly pass program will likely
increase ridership. But RTD needs to do even more to increase ridership. Raising funds from the
state to improve service by increasing frequency and reliability along major transit routes would
probably increase ridership even more.
I’m writing to share my excitement and questions about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth
pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I have questions about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. I use RTD as much as possible, but find that my bike is a more reliable way to get around.
I'd love to see increased frequency, more consolidated lines focused on Denver and less on the
suburbs, and better north/south routes. I'd also love to see free fares for all kids (under 18) and more
emphasis on supporting bus routes that get middle and high school aged kids to school and back
without having to rely on cars. I urge you to adopt these fare changes, implement them as soon as
possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward
affordability and equity to make our transit system accessible for all. Thank you. -- amy campbell

Airport employees currently are nearly punished for commuting on the RTD with the monthly pass
being $200 (no benefit for a regular commute of less than 20 days/month). If you bring this down,
you’ll be bringing more employees to the airport and therefore more sustainable growth for Denver!
love the changes in general. it's easier and cheaper. however, the airport is still too expensive. I think
it's ok to charge a premium for the airport but only if the service is top notch. to qualify for such a
premium, I think frequency would have to increase as well as reliability. I don't think the current
service qualifies for $10
I would like to express my support for the proposed fare structure recommended by the Fare Study.
The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders (I moved here last year and it took
some time to understand it). I believe the proposed $88 monthly pass will offer anybody who uses
RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who work at Denver Airport. I am also in
support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply discounted monthly fare caps /
passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare recipients and riders with
disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a huge benefit to the districts’
high school students and will instill the transit goals our nation wants in our young folks.
Hi, just wanted to say that I'm a fan of the reduced monthly fare. I've previously considered getting a
monthly pass because it would encourage me to take the train more. The previous monthly price
simply did not make sense unless I was commuting daily. The more people that have a monthly pass
the better, it's much easier to decide to ride transit if it's already paid for
This policy does sound more equitable.
I support the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare Study. The new fare
structure is much simpler to understand and is more equitable for people who rely on transit for
many trips a month. The lower fares and simplified pricing structure may increase ridership while
being cost-effective for frequent riders. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and
providing steeply discounted monthly fare caps/passes and airport fares for low-income riders,
seniors, Medicare recipients, and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares.
Hello, thank you for reducing the airport fare and suggesting the Zero Fare For Youth pilot. I think this
is huge because the current pricing is still an unattractive option for many families. Take for example a
family of 2 adults and 2 children taking a 5 day trip. The round trip A-line cost is $80 and parking at
the airport will be approximately $86 (in the Economy lot which is a 5 minute walk). With the Zero
Fare For Youth program, that same A-line roundtrip comes down to $40, a much more attractive
option!
As a refugee resettlement caseworker, I support the simpler fare structure of local/airport instead of
local/regional/airport. The lower cost of a monthly pass is also a great idea. We support our new
refugee and immigrant neighbors with bus passes as they search for and begin employment in metro
Denver. We often purchase passes or ticket books in bulk so I highly support the recommendation
"to support nonprofits, employers and social service organizations through bulk purchase discounts,
Pass program expansions and a transit assistance grant program." Our nonprofit's budgets are very
tight and any way to help our newcomers make it around the city safely are welcome. We are in high
need of volunteers & workers who could provide transit training to our newcomers, so a grant
program to help pay for that would be something we could apply for. Thank you.
Thank you for proposing more affordable fares!!
I support efforts to reduce fares to make transit access more equitable and increase ridership.
I've been away for the last two years but I miss riding the trains. I'd like to think with the new fare
structures and an e-bike, people would give up driving as much do the monthly pass. April 2019 - Oct
2019 was a great period in my life when I took my e-bike on the G and A line getting off at Central
Park and riding the rest. My emotional state was so much better when I rode.

I am absolutely thrilled to see this simplified fare structure. One of the biggest mental barriers when
taking light rail especially is trying to figure out local vs regional zones, especially when the difference
between them wasn't always clear. Every simplification of the fare structure makes it easier and
easier to get where I'm going without having to do mental gymnastics trying to figure out which ticket
is needed, and therefore makes it easier to just ride and get where I'm going. I'm glad to see RTD
moving further in this direction. I am most excited about the single price monthly pass. Due to the
zone issues and the high cost of the current fare structure, a monthly pass has not been feasable for
me or most people I know. Reducing the cost and providing a single pass for all areas makes it much
more likely that I'll maintain a monthly pass out of convenience if nothing else.
I’m writing to share both my excitement about the proposed changes to RTD fares, as well as some
recommendations for how to continue to make RTD more accessible and equitable. First and
foremost, it's an incredible boon to riders to simplify the fare system. Thank you for doing that! Just
as exciting are the free fares for youth pilot program and consolidation of the discount programs into
one. I am concerned, though, about how the 3-hour passes will end up costing certain folks who
pay in cash to pay more, because RTD doesn't issue change. I’d like to advocate for requirements to
be relaxed so that more individuals could qualify for discounted passes. Last, I want RTD to prioritize
finding funding for a permanent free fares for youth program. Obviously, these aren't changes that
could be made without additional funding. Could RTD pursue partnerships with the state to make
these changes happen?
Price is ridiculously high and not cost effective! Especially when it’s not reliable.
When I first moved to Denver, I honestly avoided RTD because I didn’t understand the system,
specifically “local vs. regional” destinations. I had lived in DC and London and traveled in New York
and Boston on the public transportation, but those systems seemed much more intuitive to me. The
first time I used RTD was to take the A line to the Airport because I knew I couldn’t mess up the
“Airport fare.” I appreciate the combination of Local and Regional to make the system easier to
understand. And I know you’ll get complaints about the Airport fare being higher, but let’s be real for most people it is more cost effective than the alternatives of parking or Ubering, and if you can get
to the airport for less than $10 some other way, good for you and travel that way. The fact that you
don’t have a higher airport charge for discount customers and that youth are free relieves any angst I
might have about having a higher airport fee. If kids, low income families, seniors and folks with
disabilities can get to the airport cheaply, the business and casual travelers can pay $10. It looks like

RTD is listening to what its customers are asking for and I appreciate that. Hopefully this process will
show support for free fares for youth so school districts or state or local government will fund the
program.

The consolidation of local and regional fares is great. I would suggest keeping whole dollar amounts
as the fares to better facilitate cash transactions. $3 for 3 hr and $5 for day seems like a better pricing
structure in my opinion. $6 is harder to do with cash if you don't have exact change since it's a huge
loss to feed in a 10.
We should absolutely be providing free public transit for youth. Also, if public transportation in
Denver was better structured (as in does not take significantly longer then other modes of
transportation or is more direct) then more people would use it. I talk to people all the time who
want to ride buses and trains but it is simply not reasonable for their needs.
Getting rid of the regional fare is one of the smartest things RTD can do. The lower monthly rate is
fantastic, and I think youth riders should ride free always. As a daily rider, I'm excited about these
changes.
Under 19 free will get young people in habit of jumping on a bus something Denver needs
desperately.
I like that local and regional are the same fare. however, the new suggested fares are still higher than
other major cities. Chicago charges $2.25 for bus fare and $5 for airport. Houston charges $1.25 for
bus fare. Austin, which has a comparable cost of living charges $1.25 for single rides, $2.50 for day
passes. We can do better for people who rely on buses for transportation!
Without a car, I rely heavily on RTD to get to and from work. A reduced fare structure would help with
my household budgeting and make public transport a way more feasible option for some of my
coworkers stuck in traffic or who have to rely on rideshares!
There used to be so many airport employees who rode with RTD and have since stopped to the the
outrageous monthly pass cost. The new fare structure should increase ridership in the future . Thank
you
I think the proposed fare structure looks great, especially the lower monthly pass price. I work with so
many at the airport who won’t buy a monthly pass since they think $200 is too much. I think the
proposed new fare structure will increase ridership. Thanks!
sounds like an easier option. I'm in favour. Just wish to have it feel safe to ride RTD again, including
light rail. It's been awhile, and the news continues to paint a disturbing picture. Even the choice of
Chestnut Pavillion for a next community meeting is kind of scary, based on my experiences at that
location. Thanks.
it is simply criminal to charge 5.25 to get from longmont to boulder. To get to and from work i pay
that twice a day and it amounts to over 30% of my bi weekly paycheck. i may as well lyft or do really
anything but use rtd. this is public transportation make it accessible to the public.
Wonderful changes being proposed. They could be even better: Find a fare for Discount passengers
that doesn’t require having change. Make free youth fare permanent. Find a way to allow
homeless people without address to qualify for discount fare. Thank you for your good work!

predecessors since the 1950s and service never gets better. Thank you.
How are you going to be able to keep enough coins in the ticket kiosks to return 30 cents for every 3
dollar bills inserted for my discount fare? Are you going to return to having discount ticket books
available for purchase? (One of the two kiosks at Southmoor has been down since before the
pandemic!)
I'm actually just curious who is taking in these comments. Is it GBSM? Just curious. Thanks!
This makes a good deal more sense, as monthly passes will probably be used by actual city residents,
not just tourists.
Would love to see these fares lowered for more equity! This makes the monthly pass much more
appealing
Thank you for proposing to lower the fee for the train to the airport. It was always odd to me how the
current fee is so much higher than other major cities in which I've lived. The blue line from downtown
Chicago to OHare is $5. The MARTA in Atlanta is $2.50 flat rate anywhere. Ridership will increase with

had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the next H train. When that H train came, I took it, no
problem, and transferred to the E train. As I was taking the E train, everyone was removed from the

I really do not agree with lowering regional and airport fares. It goes against your own equity analysis
and just reduces revenue. Local fares are too high, but the bulk of the savings goes to regional and
airport fares. Reducing those fares is not going to move the needle on ridership as much as better
and more frequent transit within Denver. The A line will always have trouble competing with
personal transport. Ditto with regional rail, especially lines with less frequency than the A, like all of
them. Focus more on Denver and less on your regional partners. There is much more to gain in terms
of equity, ridership, climate and air quality. The price is too high for local transit, yes, but the real
problems are frequency of service and travel times and safety concerns.
Make RTD free forever. Drivers seemed much happier and it's 85% paid for by taxes anyway
I think that restructing fairs for everyone in the RTD area will be a great thing. I have friends that do
not have much money to get RTD to different places and doing this, I think would be good for them.
Also families with children, this too will assist them with getting to baseball games, schools and family
outings. Thanks in advance!
$88 is more reasonable for a monthly pass, although still overpriced (as an example, Chicago offers a
monthly pass for $75 and Omaha, a city with a similar size to Denver, offers one for $55). I would love
to ride the bus everyday bot it is cheaper for me to drive my car. The monthly rate needs to be set at
a rate that makes it a reasonable choice.
This is SO MUCH BETTTER than the current structure it's not even funny. Please, please, *please*
ensure that this goes into place. The simplification of the fare structure will provide huge benefits in
terms of day-to-day usability, and making passes only $88/month is a huge benefit to increasing
ridership.

As for the fare structure, I think that the proposed structure is more equitable...but I must add that I

and trains have an option to just tap your credit or debit card to pay the fare. As for "programs" I am

Medicare recipients and riders with disabilities. In addition, not accepting cash fare for LiVE eligible
riders creates lot of confusion and frustration with the public. This should be resolved by allowing
LiVE participants to pay with cash for their initial fare, not just for upgrades.

I used to take the A train to the airport from 40th. Why should I pay $10.00 for 2 stops? That's why I
don't take it anymore. It needs to be adjusted for where you get in to the airport. I can hitch a ride for
less than $20 round trip and not have to pay for parking on top of that.

It would be wonderful if the rate for non-profit organizations and bulk purchases were lowered. All
our students are blind and in an independence program and buy monthly passes--we are
strengthening their travel skills and they will continue to ride public transportation because of this
training.
No cost fare for students would be very helpful for our students here at Lotus that utilize Public
transit. We are a charter and do not have busing so many of our students take RTD.
I think the suggested fare changes are great. They are much easier to understand and a lot more
realistic for people to afford. Lower cost will encourage more people to use public transportation.
However, you have to do something about the smelly homeless people taking up several seats on the
lightrail. I would use it more, but I know I will have to encounter smelly homeless people and have to
suffer through that the entire ride. I also wonder what they have done to my seat before I arrived. It is
very discouraging because I want to use public transportation more.
Wow, something that makes sense from RTD. Nice work and historical occasion - first time I can recall
RTD not making a bone-headed decision. Now on to Boulder/Longmont light rail please....
After reading about the recommended fare structure, thanks, I like it, but please accept this
comment: I avoid using RTD because of safety issues. Recently while riding I witness an assault
(during the day) at a train station. Very distressing, an event that lingered in my thoughts for days.
Regardless of what RTD might do with rates, without acceptable behavioral norms I will continue to
avoid using RTD, both trains and buses
I think the new structure would not be a bad idea but I also think the idea of prolonging the discount
card would also not be able to battle the. Ninety instead of five years why not 7or 10 yrs?

Why is this not implemented yet? It is clear from a year of community feedback that it is wanted and
needed. It is a good first step to true Equity which would be eliminating fares altogether. The fare free
August 2022 clearly showed the impact specific to the RTD service area of increased ridership with
zero fares.
This new fare structure is much easier to understand and allows for tourists to see the city more
easily.
How will this effect the live program
I applaud RTD for putting a new fare structure on the table. The new fares actually make me want to
use transit more now to get to/from work, as it would be better for me financially. I hope the new
fares are approved!
I'm literally just voicing my support. This plan is amazing, absolutely no complaints.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the September 2023
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 26 service change recommendations for September 2023 provide opportunities for bus and rail
operators to select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall
operations plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan (SOP), several service change recommendations reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for service change recommendations continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to enhance
service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and environmental justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, all service changes that exceed the
established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September 2023 service
change recommendations include one major service change out of 26 total changes. Thus, an analysis is

Packet Pg. 386

17.F

required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis
report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted
the Title VI Program Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change recommendations for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends changes to 26 bus routes and two rail lines in the forthcoming September 2023
runboard. Of these 26 changes, one service has recommended additions to service 25% greater than
that of baseline service, thus meeting established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes
are shown in bold in the table below.
Modified Services (eight services)
(Additional trips, expanded service spans,

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group and network level to identify potential disparities in service changes based
on race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings:

Packet Pg. 387

17.F

•

Of the over 25,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes
with a major service improvement (Route GS), low-income groups represented a higher share of
the population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income
populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major
service change and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a
greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-low-income
populations. Low-income areas benefited 1.19% more compared to non-low-income areas.
Therefore, no disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, minority populations received a
slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less) compared to non-minority
populations. Minority areas benefited 0.52% less compared to non-minority areas. This difference
meets the disparate impact threshold; therefore, a system-level disparate impact was found with
the recommended change.

Conclusions:
Although only one major service change resulted in a potential disparate impact at the route and network
level, Title VI concerns are minimal when comparing the service changes between the May 2023 and
September 2023 runboards. Additionally, low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income populations.
Moreover, the Route GS reinstatement increases access to key public service destinations. Overall, the
minor changes (modified services) have positively impacted equity populations slightly more than nonequity populations.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. Staff will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change recommendations and will recommend adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of service changes between the May 2023 and September 2023
runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 26 bus route/patterns in the forthcoming September 2023 runboard. Of these changes,
one service meets established thresholds for a major service change. The route listed below has proposed service
adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services being eliminated.
Service Reinstatement (one service)

GS – Golden / Boulder: Reinstate service on the GS (Golden
/ Boulder) with four trips in each direction.

Findings

Alterations to the proposed September 2023 service changes include reinstatement of the GS route between
Federal Center Station and Downtown Boulder. This route serves a high concentration of low-income
populations.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of this route with a major service change and as a
proportion to the district overall, low-income equity populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were
more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas had a +1.19% benefit
above non-low-income areas. Minority areas received a lower increase in service (i.e., were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations.
Finally, a potential disparate impact was identified, but no potential disproportionate burden at the route and
network level.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver
metropolitan area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit
service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and
reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental
justice.

17.F.a

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs
receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the
ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes proposed to occur between the May 2023
and September 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase via reinstatement
of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the
route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts on the communities RTD
serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include adding new routes/lines, eliminating existing routes/lines and changing the alignment and trip
frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service changes needed to
meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit
system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•
•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify underperforming services and
recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised
Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics to identify underperforming

services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity
analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income
households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes
but is not limited to eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households at or below 150% of the
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2017 to 2021 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis include route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts on district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2023 runboard analyzed whether an individual route’s major service
changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in
changes made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional
differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line
proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for the population within the district is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on
150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based
on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the
non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of the total population. The service area was based on the collection of
block groups within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter-mile catchment area centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of the census
block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block
group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block
group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted May 15-16, 2023. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 14 community-based organizations and schools surrounding the routes/lines to inform and
encourage community members to attend the open houses. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates,
number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the three major service
changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis

Proposed service changes for the September 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
network using 2017-2021 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to individually review the routes/lines. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations). It was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Identify routes with proposed major service changes (annual trips) of 25% or more

Changes by Transit Mode

As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, 26 bus routes will undergo service changes.
Of these, five routes will see a total increase of bus service by over 45 total weekday revenue service
hours. Changes to Route GS exceeded the major service change by being a reinstatement of previously
suspended service; it accounts for 12 of the additional daily revenue service hours.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations: a service reduction of 25% or more
Major Service Increases/Restructuring: service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
No major reductions/eliminations.

Major Service Change Increases

One bus route had major service changes, which included service increases of 25% or greater. This includes the
reinstatement of service to Route GS, considered a major service change, and is therefore included in the review.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis

Having identified the service changes that meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route or line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts
In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each major service change route were reviewed for
potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The

narrative analysis of each line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs, education, health
care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route GS - Boulder/Golden

Proposal: Reinstate route pattern with four northbound trips at 7:02 a.m., 8:22 a.m., 3:37 p.m. and 4:39
p.m., between Federal Center Station and Downtown Boulder Station. It is also proposed to reinstate
four southbound trips at 7:10 a.m., 8:19 a.m., 4:36 p.m. and 5:13 p.m., between Downtown Boulder
Station and Federal Center Station.
As shown in Table 5, a lower percentage of the district’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-minority population (1.07% vs. 0.44%,
respectively). This difference exceeds (falls below) the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.96%).
Therefore, a potential route-level disparate impact is found, requiring further examination (i.e., access
to key public service destinations, community engagement, and network-level analysis). However, a
higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed Major
Service Increase as compared to the higher-income population (1.68% vs. 0.55%, respectively). This
difference does not exceed (falls below) the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.50%). Thus, there is no
disproportionate burden at the line-level.

Network Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a network-level analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analysis. A network-level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts and identify structural issues in areas requiring further review.
Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or greater
(additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes experienced
service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major service changes are
later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels (block groups within route
service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 43 weekday revenue hours.
Of the over 25,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher population share than district averages. Of this cumulative
figure, over 12,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.
At the network level, equity routes and non-equity routes 1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average low-income
populations.

In the review of Route GS at the network level, there is a potential disparate impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2023 to September 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups, whereas non-low-income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.
Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.3%) and
minority population (36.9%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

Based on the existence of the route within the May 2023 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2017-2021 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the district 2. Using the 2017-2021
5-Year ACS Estimates, the total population residing within these block groups was calculated, as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the district-wide lowincome and minority rates that set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average. While
the percent minority figure of 36.9% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.049 million)
the low-income population percentage of 14.3% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure (3.005
million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine 3. The
thresholds summarized in Table 6 yielded 831 (38% of all) block groups above the district average for lowincome population, and 830 (38%) block groups above the district average for minority populations.

The proposed major service change was examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
on underlying populations. Table 7 summarizes the change in service for the block group population within onequarter mile of bus stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to the population in the
district. This comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service
changes compared to the overall equity composition of the district. No major changes were proposed for rail
services with the September 2023 runboard.

For system-level bus service changes, minority populations stand to benefit slightly less than non-minority
populations (0.44% vs. 1.07%, respectively). The difference meets the Disparate Impact Threshold of 0.96%.
Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service changes. Lowincome populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income income populations (1.68% vs. 0.55%
respectively), with low-income areas benefitting 1.19% more than non-low-income areas. Therefore, no systemlevel disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service changes.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above-average low-income and minority block groups within the district
and highlight the bus route with a major service change (orange). Route GS is currently suspended and is
proposed to be reinstated with four trips in each direction/peak period.

The May 2023 to September 2023 service changes are captured in Figure 3 and vary by the extent of the route
and segment changes. This map provides a generalized view of where service is changing at the route pattern
level. The May 2023 bus network is colorized according to the percentage change in service hours. Route GS is
shown in blue (100% service change). The network also includes Route 16 in teal, representing significant
modifications to its alignment and accompanying service hours (33%). Other routes shown in green have
changes below the major service change threshold. All other bus routes, shown in gray, are programmed to
undergo minimal (e.g., schedule adjustments, minor realignments) or no service changes in September 2023.

Summary of Findings
The network changes proposed between May 2023 and September 2023 include modifications to service that
include schedule adjustments, changes to summer schedules and trip availability, additional trips and longer
service spans. The major service change increase was entirely invested in bus service. No major rail service
changes or service reductions were included.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

Of the 26 total services with proposed changes, one had a potential disparate impact finding.
Route GS has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.52% less of a
benefit than non-minority populations.

Table 8 summarizes major service changes by the change type, provides findings of potential disparate impacts
and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis and provides the individual route

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether an alternative would
serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that no alternatives
would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or a disproportionate burden on low-income
customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed September 2023 service changes 4 include the reinstatement of Route GS,
which serves low-income populations at a rate higher than the district average.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s ongoing pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty serve as
justification for maintaining the September 2023 service changes proposal.

Systemwide-level Findings:

16

•

Of the over 25,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes with a
major service improvement (Route GS), low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income populations

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major service
change and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a greater increase
in service (were positively impacted more) compared to higher income populations

•

Low-income areas benefited +1.19% more compared to higher-income areas

•

Minority populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less)
compared to non-minority populations

•

Minority areas benefited 0.52% less compared to non-minority areas meeting the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore a system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed change

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) as is
required by 49 CFR Parts 674 and 673 and 4 CCR-723-7, Rule 7345.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dan McClain, Chief Safety Officer/Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) PTASP Rule requires each operator of a public transportation
system that receives federal funds under FTA's Urbanized Area Formula Grants to develop a PTASP that
includes the processes and procedures necessary to implement a Safety Management System (SMS).
While the FTA retains regulatory authority for compliance with PTASP requirements, pursuant to federal
and state law, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is the established State Safety Oversight
Agency with authority and primary responsibility for enforcing program standards. CPUC regulations
require the agency to update its PTASP annually and the CPUC is the entity with authority to approve
the PTASP and certify to the FTA that it meets current FTA requirements.
DISCUSSION
The revisions to the 2024 PTASP as compared to the 2023 Board-approved version are:
• Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee and GM/CEO approval prior to Board of Directors
review and approval as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
• Three-year rolling average and target for safety performance indicators as reported to the National
Transit Database as required by the BIL
• Incorporation by reference of the Emergency Operations Base Plan as required by 49 CFR 673
and 4 CCR-723-7, Rule 7345
• Notable continuity with
o The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, including mission, vision, values, and strategic priorities
o Current agency structure
o Line management accountability
o Cross-organizational coordination
In approving this PTASP and associated exhibits, the agency complies with federal and state regulatory
requirements.

1.1

Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes the agency’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals,
and the organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next five
years of the agency’s future. The document — against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities are
measured — serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality the agency will bring with its
redefined mission: We make lives better through connections.
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s
executive leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four
strategic priorities — community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial
success — that serve as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with the strategic plan; Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Parts 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State Safety
Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
The agency has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout
the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements:
SMS Element

Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

Safety Promotion

Safety training and risk communication practices to promote a culture of safety

1.1.2

Authority

RTD is a special transportation district and political subdivision of the state of Colorado and is authorized
under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and
operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and
Weld. The agency is governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the GM/CEO, who
develops and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the GM/CEO, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD chief safety officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for the operations of light rail,
bus and paratransit.

Packet Pg. 441

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for RTD.
CPUC is FTA’s certified state safety oversight agency (SSOA), working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light
rail transit, by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance,
as applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the SSOA, to determine the SSO’s and RTD’s
compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail service is regulated by the FTA and CPUC.

1.1.3

Policy Statement

As the accountable executive for all operations and activities, I will ensure that resources are available to
make the SMS robust and successful. Executive leadership will take steps to prevent workplace incidents,
injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. The agency will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards; and regularly review the agency’s safety programs.
The agency is committed to:
●

Integrating safety management among the primary responsibilities of all managers and employees

●

Clearly defining accountabilities, expectations, and responsibilities for the delivery of SMS
performance for all levels of staff

●

Supporting the SMS with appropriate human and financial resources

●

Developing an organizational culture that fosters safe practices, and encourages effective
employee safety reporting and communication

●

Enhancing hazard identification, analysis, and safety risk evaluation activities, including an
employee safety reporting program, to eliminate or mitigate the safety risks resulting from all
activities to a level of safety as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP)

●

Complying with federal, state, and agency safety-related requirements, rules, and standards

●

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment, and
training

●

Establishing and measuring our safety performance against realistic, data-driven safety
performance indicators and targets

●

Continuously improving safety performance through management processes that ensure
appropriate actions are taken and ensure effectiveness

●

Ensuring externally supplied systems and services meet the agency’s safety
performance standards

Managers and supervisors are responsible for communicating this policy to employees supervising
and training workers in safe work practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work, behaviors,
and compliance with agency safety rules and work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and
supervisors will lead safety efforts by example.

All employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting hazards,
unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety committee/
department representative.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard to any level of management. All employees are required
to abide by the standards and procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Behaviors such as
illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered
outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the CSO, who has direct access to me. All levels of
management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest level of safety performance,
starting with the General Manager and CEO.

17.G.a

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. Customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, operate, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable
with the safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. The agency’s objectives will be
met by drawing information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific
agency requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
The agency will track the following safety performance measures as required by the National Public
Transportation Safety Plan:
●

Fatalities (total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Injuries (total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Safety Events (total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

Integrating Safety into All Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.
The agency accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee
meetings, weekly safety messages, safety campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety concerns or representation
are presented. As examples:
● Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is a part of Planning Department
meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the earliest opportunity
●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative participates in Transit Oriented Development
meetings to identify and raise safety concerns

●

In new construction projects, safety is considered in the Design and Construction Meeting, System
Safety Working Group, Activation Committee and/or other processes where relevant

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is in the Technology Advisory Group
regarding the selection and implementation of new technology programs

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative works with Communications for signage,
vehicle wraps, handouts, billboards, advertisements, and social media to maximize safety
messages to the community

●

Safety is incorporated into training in divisions, such as Roadway Worker Protection, Safety
Management System, and Security/Incident Command Structure training

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative reviews procurements that involve safetysensitive products or services and ensures proper safety language is in all contracts

RTD Board of Directors and Executive Leadership

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for the agency and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of the agency, and of the administration of business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
leadership, including chief officers and AGMs. Included among these officers is the chief operations
officer (COO), who is responsible for bus, rail and paratransit operations. The Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division has the responsibility for agency safety. The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division reports monthly to the GM/CEO.
The following activities ensure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures (SOPs) and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Promote safety awareness by incorporating customer and employee involvement

1.3.2

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers. Safe
operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the AGMs. Each department has an AGM or
chief officer, who, along with senior managers, managers, and supervisors, is responsible for implementing
policies and procedures for safe operations. The AGMs of the rail and bus divisions have charged their
management teams to effectively manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training,
policies and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance facilities
are staffed with a Manager of Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of their employees within
the facility and are supported by Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. The agency models policies,
procedures, and processes for occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) regulations.
Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of safety efforts. A significant portion of their duties
is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance and promoting a strong
safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are the key to improved
safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to monitor safety
compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and the associated
safety requirements.
Safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job duties, and
are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom they work.
All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be unsafe. System
safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and subordinates to increase

Climate/Geography

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.
The agency’s transit services extend throughout the Front Range area at a width of approximately 60
miles between Pine Junction and Denver International Airport. The north-south coverage area ranges from
Longmont to Lone Tree, a distance of 70 miles. Service areas include the foothills situated along the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater
than 9,000 feet above sea level in the foothills.

17.G.a

Continuous improvement is defined by the FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines safety
performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies.
A Leadership Safety Committee has been established that meets regularly throughout the year to review
the current performance of the agency against the safety performance targets and the strategic plan
objectives and to take action to address any safety deficiencies that are identified.
The agency will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update), along with performance data
for the SMS to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each process. Leadership, from the
accountable executive to managers, is involved in this management review cycle. This method is consistent
with SMS principles and allows for the resourcing and prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.6 SMS Documentation and Records
Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is described

the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

Pandemic

●

Transit-related accidents

●

Acts of violence

●

Acts of terrorism

The Emergency Operations Base Plan (EOBP) provides a flexible framework for districtwide emergency
management (See Exhibit for Plan). Each mode (light rail, commuter rail, fixed-route and on-demand
bus) will develop and update its specific emergency response plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for personnel. This plan, along with the safety program documents and SSP, describes
coordination of the following emergency preparedness/management activities:
●

Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or
Transit Police Communications

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management with assistance from the CSO

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – the agency establishes a Fire Life Safety
Committee (FLSC) for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee comprises safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering
representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area emergency response agency
representatives. The committee reviews transit system designs and recommends fire protection,
life safety and security measures, and procedural response and training needs related to the new
extension or facility project

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, the
agency is a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations
Plan (COOP) and Urban Area Security Initiative. It is the agency’s intent to collaborate with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan
area, emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. The agency,
with assistance from the FLSC, has developed emergency management operating plans and

15

procedures to address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity,
earthquakes, fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases,
medical emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the transit system
●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise will
be planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans and procedures.
These may include readiness of personnel to perform under emergency conditions; effective
coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination of regional
emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software or other means. All exercises
are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document lessons learned and actions needed
to improve the agency’s emergency operations capabilities

●

Emergency response training – Frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their roles and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC, Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division staff, with assistance from the Bus and Light Rail Divisions,
as appropriate.

1.7.2

Public Health Emergency Management and Response

The agency will identify mitigations or strategies to minimize the exposure of the public, personnel
and property to hazards and unsafe conditions, and consistent with the guidelines of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or a state or local public health authority, will minimize exposure to
infectious diseases and comply with the CDC and state and local public health orders during public health
emergencies or pandemics.

used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained within the
department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on the
local log receive their initial and final hazard ratings using the Risk Assessment Matrix. These individuals
may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received and final ratings when they are closed.
This same group may also present hazards to the local safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the
Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings may be
changed with new information or as a result of data analysis.

2.1.1.3

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the local
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the SSWG. The SSWG represents key
department managers that can make decisions, employ multiple disciplines, and can influence higher level
budgeted solutions.

2.1.1.4

Safety and Environmental Compliance Division Hazard Logs

TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of Safety and Environmental Compliance Division hazard logs.
They ensure that hazards meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the
hazard reporting system for accurate record keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from
the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division, local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors.
The following are specific hazards that are identified and mitigated at the agency level:
●

Unacceptable or undesirable hazards (high and serious hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from accident investigations

●

Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

2.1.1.5

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used for hazards that meet certain criteria:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B (high risk), or 1C, 2C, 3A, 3B (serious risk)

●

Findings of noncompliance from internal safety reviews or safety reviews or audits by regulatory
agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

21

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.a

Packet Pg. 461

In the following instances, CAPs must receive prior approval by the CPUC before mitigation activities
may begin:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Accident investigations requiring corrective action

For testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits for hazards
that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk), SSOA staff will
review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and the agency must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and
approval of the corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●
●

The action(s) to be taken to minimize, control, correct, or eliminate the risks and hazards identified
A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

2.1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan Development

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will facilitate the CAP process is
followed and properly track CAPs until closed.

2.1.2

Hazard Process Overview

The hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to leadership and CPUC.
●

TSSs are the primary points of contact for the hazard management process

●

Safety committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will assist in entering identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS facilitate development of mitigations for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry,
identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the hazard
reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

22

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.a

Packet Pg. 462

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard is elevated to the SSWG. The
SSWG will represent key department managers, have the capability to employ multiple disciplines,
and can influence higher level budgeted solutions.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard log for follow up and
possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If mitigation
or control of a hazard is not achieved through the SSWG, the hazard mitigation process may be
elevated to the Leadership Safety Committee.

2.1.2.1

Hazard Identification

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and mitigation of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of NTSB, FTA, OSHA safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached document as Exhibit E.6) will be followed by
employees in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to
move the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

2.1.3

Hazard Investigation, Assessment, and Analysis

The agency is currently developing and refining a database where events and observed hazards can
be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow management to be
proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level as soon as practicable. Safety concerns
that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS. Reported concerns will be
assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial
hazard rating. Hazards will be evaluated and risks will be ranked to ensure prioritization for elimination or
control as described in the ORM framework.

2.1.3.1

Causal Factor, Analysis and Event Evaluation

Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure
to determine causal and contributing factors of an event, or hazard, for purpose of preventing recurrence
and mitigating risk. Hazards originating from events are reviewed by TSSs, managers and supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon
risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high rating requires
corrective action. Hazards that receive a high rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.
SERIOUS hazards (1C, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local hazard logs no more
than 45 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety and Environmental Compliance Division log.
MEDIUM (1D, 1E, 2D, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A) hazards may be acceptable with review and documentation by
management.
MODERATE (2E, 3D, 4C, 5B) hazards are acceptable with review.
LOW (3E, 4D, 4E, 5C, 5D, 5E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.

2.1.3.2 Hazard Reporting Threshold to Colorado Public Utilities Commission
The agency will notify CPUC of all identified hazards in the light rail system during monthly/quarterly
reporting. The agency will notify CPUC in a timely manner of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety of the light rail system. At a minimum, the agency notifies CPUC not later than 24 hours
from time of discovery or the determination of the risk assessment code, according to the notification
procedures in the CPUC standard, of the rating of the hazardous conditions as High or Serious and set
forth in the transit agency’s Hazard Identification/Resolution Matrix:
●

1A (Catastrophic/Frequent)

●

2A (Grave/Frequent)

2.1.3.3 Operational Risk Assessment Matrix
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. To ensure risk assessments are consistent, it is important to use a standard definition.
Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe, Serious,
Limited, or Negligible.

25

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.a

Packet Pg. 465

Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a transit
system’s operating experience, evaluation of safety historical data, or the analysis of reliability and failure
data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or Highly Improbable.

The required resolution action is based on the determined risk level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation actions
that exceed funding levels authorized at each level will be elevated to the next higher level for action.

2.1.4

Hazard Control and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or mitigated so that the hazard does
not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner if the hazard is controlled. The
process of controlling and tracking hazards is recorded on the hazard log, which is generated from the
electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system are
discussed monthly with the CPUC.
Depending upon the risk ranking, hazard log entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking number,
brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the Risk
Assessment Matrix.

26

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

CAPs include:
●

Element of activity identified as deficient

●

Planned activities to resolve deficiency

●

Department responsible for implementing corrective action

●

Scheduled completion date for implementation

Hazard log entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division, safety committees, and CPUC. They are periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAPs may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed, the hazard
log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by tracking number.

2.1.4.1

Hazard Resolution

Hazard resolution refers to the methods and processes to identify mitigation strategies necessary to
reduce the likelihood and severity of the consequences associated with an identified hazard to the lowest
level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard elimination. In a transit environment,
some hazards are impossible to eliminate and others are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk
to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from protective and warning devices
to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed to achieve a tolerable risk level:
1.

Elimination – remove the hazard

2. Substitution – replacement of material or a process with another that is considered
less hazardous
3.

Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk

4.

Administrative Controls – training, signage

5. Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

2.1.5

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to
CPUC for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed
on the hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally
adopted by receiving CPUC’s signature. The hazard log will then be updated to show the status of the
identified hazard with its CAP as “CLOSED.”

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.a

The agency will monitor all CAPs and provide CPUC with quarterly updates on the hazard log.

27

Packet Pg. 467

Internally, the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will coordinate with the appropriate
department to develop a mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form
will be assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard log
with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

2.1.6

Ongoing Reporting to Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)

A TSS will review the current status and identify any issues with the resolution action and dates. The
portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system, at a minimum, are provided monthly to the CPUC.
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies the agency in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC program standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC electronic or wet
signature approval, indicating the assigned resolution and completion of the CAP.

2.1.7

Pre-Job Safety Briefings

Employees who perform infrequent tasks (less than once every three months) or high-risk job tasks (e.g.,
working at heights, energy isolation, confined space, hoisting and rigging) are required to discuss job tasks
and identified hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during pre-job briefings.

The agency operates over an eight-county district along Colorado’s Front Range area. These activities
have the potential to affect local waterways, soil, air, wildlife, vegetation, and human health. RTD’s Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division strives to exceed all state, federal, and local municipality regulatory
requirements to limit the district’s impact to the local environment. The following management procedures
detailed below are in place to ensure this goal is met.

2.2.1

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, the agency must submit an annual Tier II
chemical inventory report to their State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning
Committee, and local fire department via the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier II Submit
software by March 1 of each year. The information is made available to the public under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Tier II Submit software is updated yearly by the EPA and
completed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting
under EPA rulemaking. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity.
Common hazardous materials used by the agency that are subject to reporting include:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

New and used oil

●

Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

The agency uses many hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and
aerosols. These materials are described in the product specific Safety Data Sheet (SDS) forms.
Secondary containment, oil water separators, illicit discharge monitoring, stormwater best management
practices, and leak detection systems are utilized to help identify and remediate spills.

2.2.2

New Chemical Product Approval Program

A new product approval process is in place to ensure that all materials arriving on-site have been approved
by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for use. The process starts when the division or
group requesting a new product contacts the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division by email with
a copy of the SDS and a completed Product Approval Evaluation Form. If the material is acceptable for
use, the SDS will be placed into the electronic storage database for employees to view via intercompany
websites (e.g., Trapeze or the Hub). If the requested material is not approved, an alternative product that is
less harmful to human health or the environment may be suggested.
All employees and contractors directly responsible for safety as well as each employee who works with
hazardous materials receives training on proper storage/handling of chemical products, appropriate use of
personnel protection equipment, compliant disposal of unused materials, and how to locate SDSs.

2.2.3

Management of Hazardous Waste

District Shops is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. All other facilities are categorized as very
small quantity generators of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, solvents, thinner contaminated rags)

●

Using a product (e.g., batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, electronic waste, aerosol dregs)

The EPA and Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division regulate the generation of
hazardous wastes.
Hazardous wastes are to be stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas
or the Central Accumulation Storage Building at District Shops. Waste containers are labeled and located
near where the waste is generated. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible
for properly identifying hazardous waste, labeling waste containers, performing internal inspections,
inventorying monthly generation amounts, mitigating spills, training employees, preparing off-site
shipments for disposal, recordkeeping, and collaborating with regulatory agencies during audits.
Personnel that add or remove hazardous waste from containers are required to receive compliance training
that is equivalent to their job duties and measured through routine performance-based internal inspections.
Safety and Compliance personnel that arrange hazardous waste shipments are required to receive training
in EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site compliance and maintain Department
of Transportation (DOT) ground shipper certifications prior to receiving authorization to sign uniform
hazardous waste shipping manifests. Electronic manifests, individual site information, and notifications
are stored electronically on the EPA information system RCRAInfo. Safety and Environmental Compliance
personnel have access to the RCRAInfo database and use this tool to submit and view required compliance
documentation to the Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division.

2.2.4

Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank Management

The agency is the owner of 32 regulated storage tanks throughout the district ranging from 1,000 to
48,000 gallons of diesel, gasoline, antifreeze, and lube oil. Storage tank systems are regulated by
the Colorado Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS). Common components of tank systems include
underground piping, secondary containment, leak detection systems, overfill protection equipment, and
automatic tank gauging. These components are monitored daily for functionality, regulatory compliance,
product inventory, and release detection. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division collaborates
with the Capital Programs Department to arrange OPS required compliance testing, inspections, and
certifications for tank systems.
Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure Plans (SPCC) that are certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer (PE) are in place at RTD facilities that store over 42,000 gallons of petroleum products in
underground storage tanks (UST).
Each of the six facilities that utilize underground storage tank systems to fuel vehicles has onsite
B-operators (Facilities Maintenance Supervisors) that oversee day-to-day operations and maintenance,
an A-operator (Manager, Facilities Maintenance Operating Facilities) that direct B-operators in their work,
and a listed facility contact (Manager, Environmental Compliance) that collects required compliance
documentation and is the liaison between the agency and OPS for audits, site characterization reporting,
and general inquiries at all six facilities. All three of these positions require OPS approved A- or B-operator
training through an approved training provider.

Packet Pg. 470

Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel are required to download and store compliance
documentation from the InSite360 Veeder-Root remote monitoring system at a minimum of every
30 calendar days. Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local B-operator and the tank
compliance contractor for resolution. Compliance reports that are run include tank tightness testing, liquid
sensor reports, and alarm history.

2.2.5

Stormwater Management

To comply with the provisions of the Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD), the agency has
historically held a number of stormwater discharge permits for operating maintenance divisions, rail
corridors, stations, construction activities, and the Tunnel 16 Groundwater Treatment Facility. These permits
authorize the discharge of stormwater from these locations to the local waterways provided that the
agency and its contractors follow the requirements listed on each set of Colorado Discharge Permit System
(CDPS) issued documents. Common CDPS requirements include:
●

Illicit discharge detection and elimination procedures are in place

●

Construction site runoff controls are in place before and after project completion

●

Good housekeeping activities are continually practiced, monitored, and improved if needed

●

Internal training is conducted annually to help employees recognize and report illicit discharges

●

Proper storage and containment systems are in place for hazardous materials

●

Conducting internal inspections and collaborating with facility personnel to correct findings

●

Numeric or practiced-based effluent limitations are being met

●

Annual reporting is completed accurately and submitted to WQCD

●

Monthly submissions of Discharge Monitoring Reports through EPA’s NetDMR System

CDPS issued permits historically held by the agency include:
●

COR900000 Light Industrial Activity (operating facilities)

●

COR070000 Non-Standard Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (rail corridors/stations)

●

COG318000 Discharge from Long-term Remediation Activities (Tunnel 16 GWTP)

●

COR400000 Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activities (East Metro
UST replacement)

2.2.6

Stationary Source Air Emission Management

Operating maintenance divisions that use boilers, paint booths, outdoor fueling stations and parts washing
units that exceed Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment established thresholds are
regulated by the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD). The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division is responsible for gathering fuel, natural gas, and paint consumption throughput from these
sources and must be prepared to submit inventoried data to APCD upon request. Air Pollution Emission
Notifications must be submitted prior to operating systems that exceed APCD thresholds and renewed
every five years or before that time if significant alterations have occurred or will occur.

The Platte and East Metro bus maintenance facilities have large boilers that must be managed to follow
specific permit requirements, including:
●

Adhering to emission limitations set forth in the individual permits

●

Not allowing visible emissions to exceed 20% opacity during normal operation

●

Supplying diesel fuel to the boilers that contain less than 0.5% sulfur by weight

●

Ensuring the units are maintained in a manner to follow the manufacturer’s operating recommendations

2.2.7

Industrial Hygiene

The agency is in a continual cycle of renovation, repair, construction, and demolition of current facilities.
Safety and environmental considerations for these projects include:
●

Identification and abatement of asbestos and lead paint, and other contaminants present in
building materials that are to be disturbed

●

Proper identification, monitoring, and disposal of contaminated groundwater and soils

●

Removal of hazardous wastes that a previous facility owner may have left behind

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division uses a third-party environmental consulting firm in
most cases to identify, mitigate, and prepare required reports for these activities. These environmental
consulting services can often be very expensive and time consuming. Identifying and addressing the need
for these environmental services at the inception of new projects is helpful in avoiding project delays, cost
increases, and non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies.
The agency’s facilities and properties may encounter industrial hygiene (IH) issues throughout their life span
that include:
●

Mold evaluations

●

Presence of air contaminants

●

Environmental site assessments

●

Site characterization reports

●

Visual emission opacity readings

Facilities throughout the district require routine IH evaluations that include:
●

Laboratory testing of 27 individual oil water separators at six different facilities

●

Preparation of monthly discharge monitoring reports (Tunnel 16 GWTF)

●

Groundwater sampling and annual reporting to OPS for the Platte Bus Maintenance Facility

2.2.8

Emergency Spill and Biological Waste Response

The agency serves an eight-county district of over 3 million people and uses a large amount of petroleum
and chemical products on a day-to-day basis. The agency frequently has a need for additional spill and
biological response assistance due to accidents, incidents, and crime.

The agency uses multiple emergency spill and biological cleanup contractors for situations that involve:
●

Chemical releases that are beyond the capabilities of staff and resources

●

Biological spill cleanup situations

●

Unforeseen situations that are beyond the scope of personnel work duties

●

Spills that reach storm water drains or local waterways

●

Mold and asbestos remediation

These contracted service providers are approved and funded through the RTD Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. On-track safety training is provided to contractors via the Litmos learning system.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible for reporting spills that exceed state and
federal established thresholds to the appropriate regulatory agency.

2.2.9

Management of Petroleum Contaminated Debris

Due to the large amount of petroleum contaminated rags, wipes, pads, and absorbents that the agency
historically generates at local maintenance facilities, it has been a long-standing best management
practice to separate most of this material from normally occurring trash throughout the facilities. Operating
facilities are equipped with specialized containers (mini-boxes) that are lined with thick cubic-yard-size
polyurethane tote bags that are manifested, sealed, and picked out of the mini-boxes by boom trucks and
taken separately offsite to avoid comingling with normal outgoing refuse. The contents of the mini-boxes
are profiled through a vendor-supplied customer database that also stores shipment details. The debris is
verified to be non-RCRA hazardous waste through periodic sampling and analytical lab reporting through
which the RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance Division contracts. Pickup requests are called in by
local Storeroom Supervisors or RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel.

measure, and review its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards.
These processes, safety performance targets, and reports provide assurance to leadership that the
organization and system are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules
checks, and compliance verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable
measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews are conducted semiannually to ensure compliance with the
SMS and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is
completed. Senior leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend
corrective action if necessary and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail review
report is compiled each year in January and submitted to the CPUC by Feb. 15. The report documents
the review findings for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during the previous
year; a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow-up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be accompanied
by a formal letter of certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that the agency is in compliance with
its SMS. If areas of deficiency are identified, the GM/CEO will identify the activities the agency will take to
achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.
As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The CSO is responsible for and has
complete authority to conduct ISRs. Two reviews are conducted annually, one in the summer and one in
the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and
CPUC requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is in the last quarter of the third year, is reserved to
review and revise the audit process to ensure that all elements are completed and that the program meets
CPUC requirements.
The agency will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.

Packet Pg. 476

The agency has 30 days to respond to the draft report, including an opportunity to correct any findings.

3.1.1

Inspections, Field/Co-op Audits, and Reviews

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts periodic inspections, field audits/co-op
walk-throughs and safety reviews. Maintenance facilities are inspected monthly to ensure compliance with
occupational safety regulations and common fire safety practices. Any deviations from required activities or
identified safety hazards are resolved through a formal reporting process.

3.1.2

Hazard and Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting,
and Corrective Action Plans

Formal investigations shall be conducted for all reportable events. All hazards and accidents are
investigated according to the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure.
All reportable transit events, as defined in 4 CCR 723-7-7348 and 7350, will be tracked and evaluated by
the CSO and the affected chief/AGM. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will oversee
event investigation activities with the CPUC and will provide as much advance notice as practicable to
notify the CPUC of an accident investigation. When investigating an accident as defined in 4 CCR 7237-7347, the agency will give prior sufficient telephone or email notice to CPUC staff of the times that an
accident investigation team will convene to conduct interviews, inspections, examinations, or tests to
determine the cause of the accident.
Light rail control will notify the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division of every accident that
meets the criteria listed below. Light rail accidents and incidents are investigated according to SOP 103.2–
Incident/Accident Investigation and the Policy and Procedure for Event Notification, Reporting,

3.1.3

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data,
and Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, accident investigation
reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident
matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records and the hazard management program.
This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of key safety performance indicators and
targets. The agency reports the following to National Transit Database (NTD):
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Safety events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for light rail, bus and paratransit to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance of
delivering transit services. In addition, the agency selects additional performance measures and targets,
both leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. The agency communicates safety
performance information internally using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
The agency will make its safety performance measures improvement and targets available to applicable
state agencies (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation) and metropolitan planning organizations
(currently Denver Regional Council of Governments). To the maximum extent practicable, the agency will
coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external entity safety performance targets.
The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for a minimum
of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by the
document control process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division maintains data and documentation of activities required by
the SMS.

3.1.4

System Modifications or Major Repairs

New fixed facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure
Change Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

3.1.5

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard Resolution

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the risk management program
process as described in section 2. This process is facilitated by the Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division and performed jointly by the Capital Programs, Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance divisions. New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are
ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented.

3.1.5.1

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety and Environmental Compliance
divisions. This review is conducted to ensure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely
and operationally integrate into the existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations
and Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety and Security
Certification Program and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides
an identification, design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications.
Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria
The agency has a process to request variances to design criteria. All variances go through three levels
of review. Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the
CSO and the GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate
acceptable modifications. The AGM of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution
of the design criteria. The design criteria will be reviewed prior to new corridor construction.

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures
Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Contracting and Procurement Division and the division manager of the requesting
division. Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of
buses or light rail vehicles (LRVs) vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Operations Department and technical support staff develop detailed specifications through the
design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of design and
personnel from other transit agencies, where relevant. In addition to procurement specifications, the safety
and security certification review process described in Section 3 governs light rail construction.

Management of Change (MOC) Infrastructure changes will be managed through the Infrastructure Change
Review (ICR) process, which is managed by the Capital Programs Department. The MOC process is
managed by the CSO and the chief engineer. MOC per federal requirements is currently beginning to be
integrated into procedures. The ICR process coordinates physical changes, before they are implemented in
the existing operating environment. Formal Project Management Plans are prepared for large projects.
Representatives from each involved department and personnel from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division are represented in the ICR and MOC processes. When changes are made to existing
structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public or other groups be notified of changes
that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project
meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance
procedures, bulletins or SOPs may need to be developed. Engagement and Communications Department
personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected groups. An essential element of
communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed negative or hazardous
impacts of physical changes must be reported to the chief engineer or CSO, as soon as possible, so that
hazards may be assessed and included in the hazard resolution process.
MOC process applies to existing bus and light rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment that
may not require formal safety certification, but may have safety impacts.

3.2.1

Safety and Security Certification

Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel develop and implement safety and security
certification programs to ensure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to
the initiation of light rail passenger operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or
modification or replacement of equipment. The agency uses the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and
Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification program. An
individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. For minor extensions
or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of safety and security
certification forms applicable to the scope of work. If equipment is procured as part of a new maintenance
facility. LRVs undergo a formalized commissioning acceptance process owned by the manufacturer under
the supervision of Light Rail Operations.
The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

●

Provide consistency for project certification

With these goals in mind, the objectives of the program can be more narrowly defined. The program
objectives are to identify and verify:
●

Safety and security requirements of the system design

●

Safety and security requirements for construction and system equipment installation

●

That safety and security requirements are met or exceeded for system testing

●

That safety and security requirements are met for changes or modifications to SOPs, training
manuals, rule book, and system elements

The CSO and the manager of Safety Assurance and Certification are responsible for the management of
the program.

3.2.2

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. The agency retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to
provide quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout
the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other certifications
as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel ensure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing personnel
or TSSs will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and other devices for compliance with
specifications. Items will also be functionally tested periodically to ensure they meet standards.

Reports and Data Analysis

The results of various operational tests, including periodic efficiency checks, are compiled, and reviewed at
least quarterly by the general superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, or designated manager. A written
form of the review will be retained by Light Rail Operations and available upon request of the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division and during ISRs. An annual report completed by the Manager, Service
Delivery, summarizing the previous year’s results of the operational tests, including a trend analysis of the
available data. The annual report is retained by Light Rail Operations and provided during ISRs and on
request from the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for further review and trend analysis.

3.3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the agency’s management process, which includes coaching,
retraining, and formal discipline that may result in termination. Additionally, all accidents and incidents are
reviewed by supervisors and the Safety Division to determine if rules have been violated. The Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will determine if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary to the
rules and SOPs.

3.3.1.2 Risk Management
A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the Rail Safety Committee (RSC) or the Bus Safety Committee
(BSC) are directed to the SSWG for further tracking, review, resolution, and/or correction. Noncompliant
review findings determined to be hazardous are documented in the hazard log. A date of observation,
description of the hazardous condition, corrective action required, and implementation date are tracked until
the hazardous condition is corrected. (See section 2 for further information.) The Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to determine the
effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

3.3.2

SMS Policies, Procedures, and Processes

The agency has adopted policies, procedures, processes, training materials and employee rule books to
establish requirements and expectations for safe operations, maintenance and construction for the agency.
These are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines: prior
to revenue service of a system expansion, new bus route, or new corridor; or as recommended by the
ISR process. A committee consisting of controller/supervisors, operators, and TSSs performs the review.
Recommended SOP changes are reviewed and approved by the chief/AGM of the affected
division/department.

Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures

Preventative maintenance (PM) inspection schedules can be generated through the enterprise asset
management system per equipment manufacturer guidelines and recommendations, and as required
by local, state and federal regulations. A Maintenance Supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections
and assigns the work to their crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical
hazards, unsafe equipment, unsafe acts and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or
equipment being inspected. Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the supervisor
for review. Each department is responsible for maintaining inspection and repair records to confirm the
inspection process.

3.4.2.1 MOW (Line, Signal, and Rail Maintenance) Standards and Procedures
Line and signal technicians use a Maintenance of Way plan, which includes track safety standards,
electrical standards, SOPs and internal work instructions that outline specific testing and maintenance
procedures modeled after Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations. These are in accordance with
49 CFR Parts 233-236.

outlines all aspects of proper maintenance and inspections regarding track.

3.4.3

Tracking and Resolving Hazards Identified During Inspections

Most safety hazards and concerns are resolved immediately by employees and/or supervisors, and
require no formal tracking process. Safety-critical hazards that cannot receive immediate attention are
forwarded to the appropriate supervisor and will be reported to the manager of safety or safety committee.
An observed safety critical hazard that cannot be corrected in a timely manner will be entered into the
hazard log for tracking purposes and mitigations will be managed in accordance with the risk management
process in section 2. A CAP, responsible person, and completion date will be assigned where warranted.
Follow-up inspections will verify that the hazard has been resolved.

3.4.4

Railroad Bridge Safety Management Program

The Railroad Bridge Safety Management Program and Light Rail Transit Bridge Management Manual have
been developed and implemented to minimize damages and identify and repair deficiencies in bridges
carrying the agency traffic, to safeguard their ability to carry the agency traffic, and to minimize risk of
human casualties.

3.5.1

Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a level
of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. The agency maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that
equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service
only after they are determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident and if the equipment
is deemed safe for service. The agency has established procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery,
and return to service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met through the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of
the system. The Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) Maintenance Plan addresses incorporates the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and policies will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

●

Effective maintenance procedures require much record-keeping and information storage/retrieval

●

The technical sophistication of the LRV, and the tracking of a large, expensive inventory, place a
heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the light rail vehicle maintenance group

The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
●

Maintenance division goals and objectives

●

Contingency bus fleet

●

Maintenance management system

●

Preventative maintenance program

●

Wheelchair lift preventative maintenance program

●

Quality control program

●

New bus inspection procedure

3.6.1

Drug and Alcohol Program

The agency maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with DOT and FTA
regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive personnel and testing for
cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Human Resources Department manages this
program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in the Drug and Alcohol
Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation. The program
is administered by the manager of substance abuse and office services, who verifies compliance with the
program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees. If necessary,
follow-up training is provided.
Compliance with and knowledge of the program are accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The agency is dedicated being a trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to its
community and customers and to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for employees.
The agency and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 agree that employees must be able to
work in a drug- and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect
the rights and privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees,
customers, and the public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the
employer to restrict employees’ on-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol abuse
and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug testing
results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective employee
assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, the agency has implemented this policy to:
●

Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and discipline

●

Enforce the goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.
Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive
job classifications.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program

Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact the manager of
substance abuse and office service.

52

Packet Pg. 492

To the extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may
be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected
to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and
testing. All existing and new employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment and the signs
and symptoms that may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in the drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on agency property to perform their duties or while performing any work-related
business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on agency property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other specific requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
●

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service

●

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle

●

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service

●

Operating a non-revenue-service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
Commercial Driver’s License

●

Carrying a firearm for security purposes

●

Supervising any function listed in the items above

The agency reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions and determines which job functions may require
the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job classifications
are developed, or current job description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safetysensitive by querying the policy.

The BSC and RSC coordinate ongoing safety efforts within the transportation, facilities, and maintenance
functions of the Bus Operations Division and Light Rail Division. The committee meets monthly to update
and mitigate hazards within their facilities and on their systems.
BSCs are formed for the District Shops, Platte, East Metro, and Boulder divisions. The BSCs and RSC are
chaired by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the division, and one or more employees from the following areas,
which may include, but is not limited to: Street Operations, Bus Operations, Bus Maintenance, Facilities
Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area (e.g., Treasury).
RSC consists of up to any manager within the division, and one or more employees from the following
areas, which may include, but is not limited to: Operations, Vehicle Maintenance, Field Supervisors,
Facilities Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area.
The ATU 1001 appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC and RSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC or RSC,
through an open communication process. Minutes are maintained and distributed to the members and the
transportation managers through various physical and electronic means.
The minutes contains a risk register with open item list of issues brought forward at BSC meetings,
submitted through the Hazard Management System, or placed in the safety suggestion boxes posted at
each division. The risk register will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the committee;
an initial, perceived, and final hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code); and the estimated month/year the
corrective action will be completed. There also is a log of closed/completed items, as well as informational
items for employees. Most safety issues are resolved within the parameters of the BSC. Issues not resolved
in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, will be elevated to the next higher-level safety committee, the Joint
Labor-Management Safety Committee, or ultimately to the Leadership Safety Committee.
Safety Committee actions include the following:
●

Reviewing facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff, reviews,
or inspections

●

Assigning responsibility for correcting hazards

●

Reviewing open items for completion

●

Reviewing effectiveness of mitigations

●

Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (e.g. FTA, CDOT, OSHA)

4.1.2.4 Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Large Scale Projects Only)
The FLSC serves as a liaison between project safety and local police, fire, and emergency response

The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire and life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance with the system. Drills are initiated during the activation
phase and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an effective
interagency rapport.

4.1.2.5 System Safety Working Group (SSWG)
The SSWG comprises subject matter experts from all departments who collaborate to review, implement,
and execute a system process required to complete a project or event that has been identified. This group
reviews systems or issues with the perspective of looking for hazards, identifying risk to:
●

Design or engineer problems out of the system

●

Correct through SOP

●

Mitigate with personal protective equipment

●

Eliminate the risk/hazard

The SSWG may not change the scope of the project but may make decisions that relate directly to the
remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the scope phase of
the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job-specific Certified Items List (CIL) and creates and maintains the Preliminary
Hazard Analysis (PHA). If the SSWG determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below
the medium risk level, then the SSWG presents its findings to Leadership Safety Committee in accordance
with the Operational Risk Management Policy and Framework.

4.1.2.6 Investigation Team
This team comprises staff from various departments that have a role in the development of a CAP or
mitigation singular resulting events, occurrences, accidents, and incidents. This process will follow the Event
Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedures.

4.2.1

Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, the agency does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety
training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD
rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train
their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination
of contractor training cards. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division maintains a log of all
contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing (to include operational tests and efficiency checks), any operating or
maintenance rule is subject to verification and compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification
requirements is verified in several ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field
by supervisors and Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel; however, a supervisor
must discuss an observed rule violation with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition to ongoing
monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal ride checks in which supervisors,
usually anonymously or covertly, observe operators according to predetermined criteria or a checklist.
These ride checks are documented, reviewed with the operator, and maintained in the operator’s
employee file. These records are subject to verification during the ISR process. Any trend or issue
discovered during system monitoring, observation, and ride checks is reported to divisional leadership and
the CSO for inclusion in the operational risk management risk register.
Bus, rail, and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification of
their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and approved
for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order process. When a Maintainer
completes a work assignment, the direct supervisor verifies and approves the work through observation
and signature approval on the work order. The maintainer will enter in the enterprise asset management
system that the work is complete, and the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed
during the ISR process. Supervision is assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation
and compliance with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or
findings in the review report. Review findings are referred for inclusion in the hazard
management program.

4.2.2

Operator Certification

Light Rail operators must complete a course based upon light rail SOPs and rules prior to certification.
Written tests and practical examinations are administered, and operators must score 100% on the Hands
Bells Signals test with a cumulative final examination score of 80% to pass. A minimum of three weeks is
spent in the LRV in actual operation with a revenue instructor. Competency standards are established in
the “Regional Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see Exhibit XVI and section 4.3,
Light Rail Operator Training).

meeting the Entry-Level Driver Training federal guidelines. Training consists of six weeks of classroom and
behind the wheel training, and three weeks of on-the-job revenue training. This training program covers
rules and SOPs before entering revenue service. Participants must pass a series of eight written tests with
a minimum score of 75% before moving to revenue training. Prior to entering service, operators must pass
a final drive examination with a minimum correct score of 75%.

4.2.7

Operator Recertification

Bus operators undergo annual refresher training of no less than eight hours. The general timing is
quarterly, and training sessions topics include, defensive driving, safe driving evaluation, vehicle inspection,
basic control skills, road testing, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Additional training includes
de-escalation, training on new equipment, and major changes in procedures. Training after an extended
absence from work is progressive, depending upon time away from driving. This training covers the topics
from the active operator sessions and includes an additional safe driving refresher.

employees based on job hazard analysis. Annual refresher training is conducted for high-risk tasks
and activities.
All employees and contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10 feet
of centerline of track) must receive OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible for
ensuring that their employees complete OSHA-required training prior to performing projects.

4.3.4

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

All contractor work on or near agency light rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an
access permit, the contractor is required to meet with staff from Capital Engineering and Rail Operations
to describe and coordinate their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit,
which is reviewed and approved by Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Transportation and Safety and
Environmental Compliance prior issuance by Light Rail Maintenance of Way. The contractor is bound
to the requirements of the permit. All contractors working with the agency are also bound by contract
specifications for the work they are to perform.
Key documents guiding the management of construction safety are: the Construction Safety Guidelines,
and the Safety and Security Certification process. The Construction Safety Guidelines presents the
requirements for construction projects and follows OSHA construction requirements and regulations.
Contractors are required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of contract
specifications and access permits.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts construction safety oversight to monitor
contractor workplace safety and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety
orientation prior to project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety
meetings are conducted between the agency and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction verification.
The plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection documentation, equipment

responsibilities and other construction safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation,
safety personnel, and safety certifiable items. All contractors’ employees must comply with OSHA rules and
the requirements of the construction safety program, rail services rule books, SOPs, and individual contract
agreements with the agency.
The proposed construction methodology is reviewed during project planning. The contractors are
responsible for ensuring that work is performed in a safe manner. Emphasis is placed on work that may
affect agency operations, customers, facilities, and personnel. All contractors working in the agency rail
right-of-way or interfacing with rail operations are required to attend OTST. This training covers track
access, right-of-way flagging, and operating procedures. Contractor reviews are conducted to ensure
compliance with federal and state laws and agency requirements.
The agency has established a training and certification class for rail roadway workers (OTST). All
construction and agency employees who may work on or near the tracks are required to attend this
training annually and obtain a certification card or sticker to keep on their person.

4.3.6

Training and Certification Records

The agency maintains training and certification records for safety related training.
Records for the following training are maintained in employee training records and are available for review:
train operator certification, train operator recertification, controller certification, controller recertification,
equipment certification, lineman’s course, signal certification, and basic/advanced track principles.
These records are available directly from light rail department managers. The training supervisor and
management review the training records to determine completion. Most training is done annually, with all
operators and supervisors being trained in the same month.

Task to be completed
If an operator complains about ingesting smoke from drugs on a
train, have them stop the train at a station and open all doors (to the
platform side) to ventilate the car.
Instruct the operator to ask passengers to board another car in the
consist. Have the operator deboard so they can get fresh air. The
train and operator can hold at a station for 3-5 minutes to allow the
train time to clear the air.
Start a supervisor to the location.
Make sure the operator makes an onboard announcement that the
train will be delayed at the station for several minutes. They do not
need to explain why.
After 3 minutes, ask the operator if they feel safe to continue. If they
feel safe to continue, have them continue in-service to their last
stop. Have a supervisor meet them there to further evaluate them
and see how they are doing.
• If they feel unsafe to operate, follow the protocol for
relieving an operator in the field or have the responding
supervisor operate the train out of service to a storage
location.
• If the operator is relieved, have them fill out an OJI form.
• If the train is removed from service, park the consist and
open the doors for 30 minutes to allow it to air out.
Remind the operator to NOT contact the person smoking on the
train. Ask them to get a description of the person and inform
security.
Ask the operator if they need medical attention. Document yes or
no. If no, document that they declined medical assistance. If yes,
determine if they want EMS to respond, if they should be
transported to an authorized worker’s comp facility, or if they decide
to seek medical treatment from an authorized worker’s comp facility
on their own.
Make a log entry using code 9704 (OJI Relief) so we can track the
number of times this happens.

Event Investigation
•

Note: Events required to be reported to the CPUC and the facts discovered
during the investigation are considered privileged and highly confidential

•

Investigate and gather facts to identify causal factors of events to reduce or
eliminate systemic causes and to prevent future events

•

The manager has accountability to own/delegate, coordinate and ensure an
event investigation occurs

•

The investigation owner, as defined by event type in the Event Investigation
and Notification Determination Table, may delegate investigation to the
appropriately trained individuals to conduct the investigation. The
Investigation Owner may have to coordinate with other functional groups to
ensure resource availability.

•

The investigation owner or designee will schedule a post event meeting within
72 hours of the event, to include:
•

General Superintendent or designee

•

Assigned Transit Safety Specialist

•

Business Program Manager or designee

•

Investigator

•

The purpose of the 72 hours post event meeting is to determine whether all
necessary information has been gathered to complete a causal analysis
including contributing factors It will also determine the level of post event
investigation necessary and establish future meetings to ensure appropriate
Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) are developed and implemented. It will also
determine the level of investigation necessary and establish future meetings
to ensure appropriate CAPs are developed and implemented

•

The next step in the process is to determine whether there is a need to identify
other suitable persons from within the agency to assist in the investigation
process
•

Note: basic, medium, and high-level investigations shall be conducted
if the event/incident meets any of the criteria defined in Section 2.3
and the attached Event Investigation and Notification Determination
Table (Appendix 1)

to determine the type of investigation methodology to be applied

•

The Investigation Owner must specify the level of investigation required in
accordance with the Event Investigation and Notification Determination Table,
and it is the responsibility of the investigation team, to use that methodology

•

There are three levels of investigation methodology to be used as follows:
o Basic Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of moderate or low
using the basic reporting framework through the application of the “5
Whys” methodology
o Medium Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of medium using
the event investigation methodology, “5 Whys” methodology or
Systematic Cause Analysis Technique (SCAT)
o High Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of high or serious
using SCAT or Why Tree which is defined in the event investigation
training program

Recommend Corrective and Preventive Actions
•

Once the causal factors determination has been completed and the causal and
contributing factors determined, the next step for the investigation team is to
develop CAPs to address the causal factors discovered and identify
opportunities to strengthen systems and processes. In doing this, it is
important for the investigator/investigation Team to:
o Organize conclusions sequentially, preferably in chronological order or
in logical sets
o Base conclusions on the facts and results from subsequent analysis of
the facts
o Include only substantive conclusions that bear directly on the event
o Keep conclusions as succinct as possible
o Link conclusions to applicable management systems
o Recommend effective mitigations for CAPs based on the hierarchy of
control to eliminate the hazard or change behaviors
o Collaborate with responsible and affected parties

•

It is the responsibility of the Investigation Team to document their conclusions
and CAP to strengthen systems and processes

The Investigation Team is to identify and recommend corrective and preventative
actions. The aim is to eliminate hazards, change behaviors and, where this cannot
be achieved mitigation methods or controls must be in place to reduce risk to an
acceptable level. In determining corrective actions, it is essential for the
Investigator/Investigation Team, to consider the effects of hazards such as:
•

Probability

•

Severity

•

Cost

Introduction
Implementing the Operational Risk Management (ORM) framework will improve how Denver Regional
Transportation District (RTD) manages risk and represents a shared commitment to an effective
process through a formal, continuous, top-down, data-driven, organizational-wide approach to
manage risk, assure effectiveness of risk controls, and promote ORM in the agency. The ORM process
applies to all risks for the agency, except financial and legal risks, which are covered by the internal
audit function. This framework outlines the tasks for implementing a formal, documented process for
ORM throughout the agency.
This effort demonstrates RTD’s commitment to improving the maturity of its approach to ORM, which
will unify the agency’s management systems and other activities to achieve agency objectives
effectively and efficiently.
Element II of the RTD Transit Agency Safety Plan (TASP) is Risk Management, which describes how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks, and mitigates risks and risk in the organization and on the transit
system. The risk management element and the processes undertaken by the agency are identified
and described in sufficient detail to be effectively undertaken throughout RTD. The acceptable risk
level and performance targets are established and documented.
Similar to a Plan – Do – Check – Act (PDCA) process, ORM is designed to be a continual effort to proactively identify and mitigate risk and to improve the data-driven, decisionmaking process within the agency. The management of identified risks is a
vital component of the RTD Operational Management System.
Risk is “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” internal or external to the
RTD system. An unacceptable risk is a condition that may endanger or
seriously harm human life, significantly destruct property or result in system
loss. This includes harm to customers, employees, contractors, equipment,
and to the general public. These risk conditions must be mitigated or
eliminated. Risks may be observed in the operating environment, through
procedures, during system modifications, while undertaking capital projects,
from investigations and audits, or operational changes.
The ORM Framework applies to all RTD employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe risks
in their work areas and report them to their safety committee, through a reporting process or to their
supervisor.
Decisions on risk should be informed to pursue the strategic priorities in the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan:
•
•
•
•

Community Value
Customer Excellence
Employee Ownership
Financial Success

Principles/Goals
An integrated ORM Framework applies to the entire organization and demonstrates the inclusion of
risk in decision-making as defined in the Operational Risk Framework.
RTD employees understand risk as “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” and incorporate a
probabilistic approach in decision-making.
The Leadership Team (LT) commits to develop, implement, and utilize a uniform, evidence based,
ORM process that will effectively and efficiently achieve a common purpose, mission, and framework.
The LT is committed to:
•
•
•
•
•

Understanding risk in the context of the probability (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen
Using ORM to guide agency actions that support delivery of the agency’s objectives within
fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints
Being transparent about the potential tradeoffs between risk, cost, and performance inherent
in all decisions
Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk
Making best use of RTD’s limited resources to meet its objectives

Any exceptions to this commitment must be documented as out of compliance and signed by the
General Manager and CEO with copies to the Chief Safety Officer. A copy of the ORM policy is
provided in Appendix A.
The continuous identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risk is key to an effective ORM. The RTD
ORM will be an ongoing process with the continual improvement goals of:
•
•
•

Increasing staff understanding of the process
Increasing use of ORM to make data-driven decisions
Improving quality and consistency of risk evaluation across the agency

1. Identify Risk
Identifying risks is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. Risk identification should
be an ongoing process. Identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
•
•

Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors
Reports from safety committee members, customers, customer service, and field personnel

Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design
or new construction
Certification, system integration testing,
configuration management, and inspection
processes
Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue

Controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback
Lessons learned
Transportation Safety Board (TSB), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Federal Transit
Administration (FTA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), safety
recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts
Nonconformance Reports and Corrective Action Plans (NCR and CAP)

Risk reporting by RTD employees is conducted through multiple methods. These include:
•
•

Directly reporting to their supervisor, safety committee or union representative
Submitting directly on the Hub, which is the agency’s intranet (click on blue safety person
link)

2. Evaluate Risk

Risk evaluation attempts to define what the risk means to employees, customers and/or the system.
The primary purpose of the risk evaluation process is to determine the elements of and reasons for
the risk with the purpose of eliminating or controlling it. The factors contributing to the risk should
be fully understood and evaluated by the employees or safety committees. Training will be required.
This understanding and evaluation will assist in determining the potential controls to put in place and
the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts.
As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause analysis using the “Five Whys?”
methodology can be used to understand root causes and determine the most effective solutions to
mitigating risks.
Part of the evaluation of risk is to determine potential controls to mitigate the risk. There are five
basic steps to mitigating risk:
•
•
•
•
•

Design for minimum risk
Incorporate control devices
Provide warning devices
Develop procedures and training
Acceptance of residual/remaining risk

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL_FINAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.b

Packet Pg. 610

Potential controls, in order of effectiveness, are:
•
•
•
•
•

Elimination – remove the hazard
Substitution – replace of material or a process with another that is considered less hazardous
Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk
Administrative Controls – training, signage
Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

The costs associated with the potential controls must also be estimated or evaluated.

2.1

Assign Risk Owner

The RTD employee responsible for most closely mitigating, monitoring, and measuring the risk will be
identified and added to the Risk Register. The employee should be well informed of the risk, be at
the lowest /closest level of responsibility and have the authority to coordinate funding and or other
resources.

2.2

Safety Committee Structure

When a risk is identified, the local safety committee (e.g., Light Rail, Bus, Commuter Rail,
CyberSecurity, Safety & Environmental) will initiate the review and action. The local safety
committee will screen submittals for the difference between non-substantive complaints and
identification of true risks. The local safety committee will maintain the risk register, assign the risk
owner and work to evaluate, assess and mitigate (if required) the risk. If the risk requires mitigation
that exceeds the funding authority at this level, the risk will be elevated to the next higher-level
safety committee, the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee or ultimately to the Leadership

3. Assess Risk
Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. In order to ensure that risk assessments are consistent, it is important to utilize a standard
definition. The detailed severity and probability definitions for various events and departments are
provided in Appendix C.

Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe,
Serious, Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a
transit system’s operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety historical data, or the analysis of
reliability and failure data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or
Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the RTD risk assessment matrix is used to determine
the risk index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, and Low. The
required action to mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures
and/or mitigation actions.

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk to determine what action(s) must be taken
to correct or document the risk. This assessment system has been incorporated into the formal
system safety analysis, which enables the safety committees, as decision makers, to understand the
amount of risk involved in accepting the risk in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to
reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The required resolution action is based on the determined risk
level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation
actions that exceed funding levels authorized at each level, will be elevated to the next higher level
for action.

Mitigation actions to address risks will be
developed based on the evaluation and
assessment by the risk owners or safety
committees of the severity or probability of
risk.

the

Critical risks identified must be controlled or
eliminated so it does not continue to pose a
danger. This may be done in a temporary
manner until a permanent solution is
implemented. The process of controlling,
tracking, and eliminating risks is recorded
the risk register.

5. Monitor Results
5.1

Risk Register

The safety team will assure local risk registers are used to track risks at the departmental level within
RTD. These registers are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local
safety committee on a regular basis. Risks placed on the local register receive their initial and final
risk rating using RTD’s 25 box risk assessment matrix. Management may also present risks to the
local safety committee for risk ratings. Risk ratings may be changed when new information is
received or as a result of further data analysis.
All risk register entries require a mitigation plan (if risk resolution is required), tracking number, brief
description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard rating/initial risk rating (IHR/IRR) using
the RTD Risk Analysis Matrix. Risk Register format example is provided in Appendix D.
If requested, or required for complicated risks, a CAP will be developed by risk owner/department
managers in conjunction with the safety committees. The committees/risk owners will ensure that
the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed. CAP's may be tracked and sorted
separate from the risk register. When a CAP is closed the risk register will reflect this action with a
closed date.
CAPs include the following information:
•
•
•
•
•

Element of activity identified as deficient
Planned activities to resolve deficiency
RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
Scheduled completion date for implementation
Estimated cost of implementation

5.2

Monitor and Measure

A regular schedule of reviewing the effectiveness of mitigation actions will be established. For risks
without mitigation measures, a similar evaluation schedule should be established to determine that
the risk remains low.
In addition to the risks, the ORM process will be regularly evaluated to determine effectiveness,
compliance, and potential improvements. Audits (internal and external) are an excellent means of
conducting this evaluation.

6. Report Outcome
RTD risks will be reported in compliance with regulatory requirements and as part of the feedback
loop to increase data-driven decisions and to enhance the confidence in the ORM process.

6.1

Public Utilities Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight Agency
(SSOA)

Report to the PUC SSOA on a monthly basis those issues and risks required for reporting within the
PUC’s jurisdiction. This reporting will provide status of mitigations and progress towards closing out
CAPs.

6.2

Employees

Report to strengthen the Employee Reporting System and enhance RTD employee confidence in and
use of the ORM process. Reporting can include posting of risk registers with updated mitigation
status.

6.3

Joint Union/Management Safety Committee

Report to the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety
committee, and on mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

6.4

Leadership Safety Committee

Report to the Leadership Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety committee, and on
mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

Executive Summary

In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated that every federally funded
transit agency in the United States must have a Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan in
place by October 2018. This iteration of RTD’s TAM Plan is the first required revision to the
TAM Plan under the prescribed schedule.
Thus the 2022 TAM Plan is the first required plan update since the introduction of the TAM
final rule. Each TAM plan has a four-year horizon, conforming to section 625.29 of Title 49.
TAM requirement nine mandates agencies to continually improve asset management
capabilities and to detail efforts to improve in the TAM Plan (Table 2). For this iteration of the
TAM Plan, the most notable improvement in asset management maturity has come by way of
actions from the General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson (GM/CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer Doug MacLeod (CFO). Together they have affirmed, through policy and
communication, the intention to make the agency Asset Management Plan (AMP) the sole
funding mechanism for non-emergency asset renewals and replacements. Further, the
GM/CEO and CFO have indicated that the AMP itself shall be improved by refining Asset
Information Maturity (AIM) to provide data and resulting information for decision-making. By
asserting that the AMP is the sole mechanism for asset renewals and replacements and
communicating that this process shall be a data-driven exercise, the GM/CEO and CFO have
the effect of making good asset management practice a required part of receiving funding for
renewals. As such, it is expected that RTD will have better alignment between the letter and
spirit of TAM regulation and agency practice. This work is also part of RTD’s Strategic Plan
and assures that TAM practice is aligned to agency goals and considered in the landscape of
objectives.
Though progress towards improving RTD’s asset management maturity and capabilities is
proceeding, it is apparent that RTD cannot achieve ISO 55000 certification within its current
capability and resources within the four-year timeframe of this plan. Though ISO 55000 has
been a central theme of prior agency TAM Plans, more fundamental issues concerning AIM
and Asset Management System (AMS) maturity need to precede an intention to seek ISO
55000 certification. It is the intention of the agency to utilize aspects of the ISO 55000
framework to design, implement, maintain, and continually improve a functioning, effective,
adequately resourced AMS, based on plan-do-check-act principles.
RTD’s Accountable Executive, the GM/CEO, established an Asset Management Accountability
Team (AMAT) that has been charged with the responsibility of developing an AMS that is
compliant to regulation and advances the Strategic Plan. AMAT is made up of the Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chief Administrative Officer (CAO),
and Assistant General Manager (AGM), Capital Programs. Though it has been communicated
in many forums that RTD would pursue ISO 55000, including prior TAM Plans, consensus and
commitment to the pursuit of ISO 55000 certification was not reached among the AMAT
members. As a result, the agency has been unable to identify a roadmap to certification and
decide upon a target date for improvements to be completed.

AMAT has been able to identify subordinate objectives, including an Asset Information
Maturity (AIM) improvement roadmap to address the information needs for a compliant AMS.
As such, AMAT has established three progressive improvement goals within AIM to guide
activities. These are:




Incremental improvements to AMP
Develop and use whole-life cost (WLC) models in decision-making
Create an “Optimized AMP” that utilizes cost, performance, and risk in data-driven
asset investment decisions

Led by the Safety Division, the agency has also made progress in developing an Operational
Risk Framework (ORF) that will be incorporated into the AMS. The ORF was developed to
satisfy requirements for the agency’s Safety Management System (SMS) and will serve as a
critical common link between the AMS, SMS, and potentially other management systems and
agency activities. The ORF is based on the ISO and American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standards for risk management frameworks. It defines risk as “the effect of
uncertainty on objectives,” and utilizes the dimensions of frequency and severity to classify
hazards and identify the required actions to mitigate or accept risks according to the defined
and documented risk appetite of the agency. This important milestone will shape the
agency’s approach to asset management and will be incorporated into the AMS via the AIM
improvement efforts. It is expected that the ORF will become an important aspect of the
decision support tools required under section three of the TAM standard to produce the list of
prioritized investments required in TAM section four. (Table 2)
At the level of the Asset Stewards, those identified as having asset responsibility in the
agency, and the Asset Management Division (AMD), those responsible for administering
aspects of the AMS described in Appendix E other incremental improvements to the AMP
have been achieved, including improvements in equipment inventory highlighted in section
2.3.2 of this plan Initial work toward WLC models has been completed. In particular, one
WLC model is indicated to have been used in evaluating asset investment requests. The
organization has not made substantive progress toward developing cost, performance and
risk measures that are used as inputs in the TAM required decision support tools and
investment prioritization process. (Table 2)
A TAM plan is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public case for investment in the
assets to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community requirements. It aims to
demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the future. While the
agency has identified the need to take a different tack on developing a TAM-compliant AMS,
the agency is still committed to honoring the letter and spirit of the TAM regulation and the
laws from which the regulation is derived. This document communicates this commitment for
the agency, its planning partners, regulators including the FTA, and the communities that
RTD serves. Accordingly, this document summarizes:

RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections, and its vision is to be the trusted
leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to customers and community (RTD, 2021).
The communities RTD serves should know how the agency invests taxpayer dollars and how
decisions are made regarding the best use of limited resources. This is accomplished in part
through transparency in decision-making processes to sustain the condition and performance
of the assets.

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and
processes does RTD
use to prioritize
funding around those
assets described in its
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD prepares and updates a six-year Mid-Term Financial
Plan (MTFP) that includes projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs. The Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the input of asset
renewal and replacement needs into the MTFP. In RTD’s Financial plans,
approximately $120M annually is planned to fund asset renewal and
replacement needs for at least the period of this plan.

4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or
output of those
decision support tools
and processes?

The result of the decision support tools and processes described is the Asset
Management Plan. The prioritized AMP is the result of the prioritization process.
The funded/unfunded AMP is the intersection of the prioritized list of needs and
the funding allocated to replacements and renewals. The funded items are
included in the MTFP and budgets, while the unfunded items are retained in the
AMP and considered in future process iterations.

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an asset management policy in June 2014 and most recently
updated in August 2022. The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD
manages assets henceforth - it is therefore forward looking in nature and
represents the agency’s vision and shared commitment for good asset
management. The AMS applies to the entire organization and directs the short,
medium, and long-term plans for assets to achieve the agency mission of
making lives better through connections.

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM Plan?

RTD has identified a framework that is intended to move the agency from a
system reliant on judgement, perception and intuition to one that will be data
driven. A focus on improvements to asset information and incremental
improvements to the AMP to achieve that desired state. Processes around the
AMP are well defined and are completed annually.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does
RTD perform to
maintain its TAM
system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities performed as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those
activities specific to improving the AMS. TAM activities are the subset of these
activities targeting specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the agency are involved in asset management activities,
including GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division (AMD),
and Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications,
Planning, and General Counsel departments.
The AMD’s in-house expertise enables the agency to employ robust asset
management practices. A reduction-in-force associated with the COVID-19
pandemic resulted in the loss of some positions within the AMD, and a shift in
emphasis from ISO 55000 certification to more fundamental AMS improvements
has somewhat changed the structure of the AMD.

9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the Agency
doing to ensure that
the TAM plan delivers
the intended results?

The current TAM plan provides the baseline for evaluating the agency’s future
plans. RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting
maturity targets in its Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP).
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements of
TAM and the agency’s strategic needs through the following measures:
 Measures identified in the Strategic Plan
 Assessments of adherence to the AMP process
 Regular AIM assessments and associated AIM improvement plans

Asset Management Policy

An Asset Management (AM) Policy is a documented commitment to achieving and
maintaining a state of good repair for all capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good
repair as “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level of
performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on August 11, 2022. The policy describes a
forward-looking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue
investment optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Asset
management performed according to this policy will result in assets that are in a state of
good repair.
The latest version of the Asset Management Policy is included on pages 13 and 14 of this
document. This document is included as evidence of compliance with TAM requirement five
(5), and is the documented executive-level expectations for asset management in the
agency.

2 RTD and its Assets

The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people
located within its 2,342 square mile service area, such services include bus, rail, paratransit
services, demand-responsive microtransit services, and special event services. Though
operating a reduced schedule, RTD used these assets to provide over 46 million revenue
miles across all modes in 2021.

2.1

The RTD Story

The Colorado General Assembly created RTD in 1969. Efforts in early years
focused on regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters approved a 0.6%
sales tax initiative to finance a multi-modal transit system. At this time, RTD
acquired privately owned bus companies, improved service frequencies, and
expanded routes in several counties throughout the metro area. By 1976,
ridership had grown to 35 million boardings annually.

RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. With a fleet of only
eleven light rail vehicles, the 5.3-mile line attracted hundreds of thousands of
customers when it began operations. Now, eight light rail lines service 57 stations
along seven individually constructed corridors.
In November 2004, voters approved the FasTracks ballot measure for the regionwide expansion of transit service. The 0.4% sales and use tax continues to fund the
FasTracks program, which has grown to include 122 miles of new commuter rail and light
rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit corridor, and numerous rail and bus stations. The program
consists of six new rapid transit corridors and three existing corridor extensions.

2.2

Service Area

The agency’s service area is composed of eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield,
Denver and Jefferson counties, large areas of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a
small portion of Weld County.

Figure 4: RTD District Map

In 2000, RTD provided approximately 77 million passenger trips. (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2000) By 2019, passenger trips grew to 105 million, a 30% increase in
boardings. Over the same period, per the Colorado State Demographer’s Office, the
Denver/Boulder region increased from approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately
3.2 million residents, a 31% increase (2019). Unsurprisingly, due in large part to the COVID19 pandemicthe agency experienced a severe decline in ridership in 2020, resulting in

approximately 52 million boardings for the year. (U.S. DOT, 2021) In 2021, the agency
reported approximately 49 million passenger boardings in as of yet unpublished National
Transit Database (NTD) submission. While ridership appears to be recovering, it is unclear
when utilization of RTD’s assets by customers will return to pre-pandemic levels.

2.3

RTD Assets

RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that capital
assets total nearly $9.3 billion, excluding accumulated depreciation (Regional Transportation
District, 2021), of which most is within the scope of TAM as detailed in this section.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time, and their risk of failure increases.
Failures, including those having an impact on safety, can manifest in a variety of ways. Asset
condition is therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and understanding asset condition
today, and how quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset,
safety, and risk management. Organizations that understand their assets’ deterioration rates
can also make more informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to
preventive maintenance. RTD’s commitment to improve AIM to support decision-making is
expected to include data on the frequency and severity of assets in accordance with the ORF.
For the purposes of this TAM Plan, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA
guidelines: revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the flowchart
depicted in Figure 5 below, adherence to which ensures repeatable results and an
improvement in inventory data quality.

Revenue Vehicles

RTD’s revenue vehicle fleet is composed of 1,454 buses, 201 light rail vehicles and 66
commuter rail vehicles. The operation and maintenance of bus vehicles is shared between
the agency and third-party contractors. The light rail vehicle fleet is exclusively operated and
maintained by the agency. The operation of sixty-six commuter rail vehicles is shared
between RTD and a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO) and all maintenance
activities on the commuter rail vehicles are performed by DTO.
Transit vehicles in the agency’s rubber tire fleet include:






Standard 40’ fixed-route transit buses with a seated capacity of approximately 40
passengers, including battery electric bus (BEB) assets
Fixed-route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses
Regional intercity coaches, such as those used for Flatiron Flyer service, built for
longer trips at highway speed, which are typically 45 feet long and have a seated
capacity of 55 passengers
Cutaways which are made by second stage manufacturers, using the chassis of fullsize vans, used to provide on-demand service for eligible customers with disabilities
(Access-a-Ride) and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service
(FlexRide)

In service RTD buses have been procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig,
BYD, New Flyer, MCI, Goshen, Eldorado, and StarTrans. Approximately 50% of standard and
articulated fixed route buses are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and
maintenance for the remainder outsourced3 to two external partner companies, First Transit
and TransDev. All intercity coaches are operated and maintained by RTD. All cutaway buses
are operated and maintained by third parties (Via Transportation, MV Transportation and
Evergreen Senior Center).

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically powered using a 750-volt direct-current overhead
catenary system. Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per
consist, with a designed seated capacity of approximately 64 per car. LRVs can carry up to an
estimated 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail vehicles are
manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained by RTD.

All of the Hyundai Rotem commuter rail vehicles maintenance is outsourced to DTO. RTD will
assume responsibility at the end of the contracted period of performance of 30 years.
Condition assessments will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes
additional responsibility for the vehicles.

Figure 11: Commuter Rail Vehicle (Hyundai Rotem)

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are
procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a
preventative and repair maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted
for revenue vehicles maintained by third parties, including buses and commuter rail vehicles.
Table 3 below presents the total number of revenue vehicles for which RTD has capital
responsibility, along with their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration
in years that an asset will remain in service according to RTD’s standards and the expected
condition based on its age. The condition range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. A vehicle that has
reached the end of its useful life benchmark is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog. (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016). The percentage of
vehicles in backlog within each type is also presented. Table 3 also presents the total initial
capital cost4 of the vehicles in each sub-fleet. In the AMP, and certain budgeting and financial
tools, costs other than the total initial capital cost are used, such as the expected
replacement value in the plan year.
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, though some buses are now considered to be
in backlog. Based on a combination of funding availability and subject matter expert
judgements, some transit buses will continue to be operated in backlog.
Regarding the ULB for LRVs, RTD is presently re-evaluating the 40-year ULB that was
approved by FTA. There are several factors that differ from what was expected when the 40year ULB was proposed. Several key components have gone out of production or will soon
go out of production. The cost of some parts that are custom replacements for parts that
have ceased production by the original manufacturer is quite high and would lead to
increases in the WLC of the LRVs that are not manageable. Until that formal evaluation can

considered for inclusion in a subsequent generation of the TAMP.

RTD’s LRVs vary in age, and only the oldest trains model year 1993 (eleven units) and 1996
(six units) SD-100 series would be evaluated for retirement in the near future with a shift
from the approved 40-year ULB to the standard 31-year ULB utilized by most agencies. This
represents only seventeen vehicles of the total 201 vehicle fleet and would not be expected
to affect RTD’s ability to deliver light rail service within the scope of the period of the TAM
Plan. This approach of using WLC modeling for making asset renewal decisions is a first for
RTD and is expected to set the tone for future asset renewals in the future.

Equipment

Significant improvements in equipment asset information have been made since the last
iteration of the TAM plan. The TAM Systems guidance was helpful in improving the agency’s
understanding of current and future expectations of equipment information in the TAM
framework. (U.S.DOT, 2020) While the present TAM requirements indicate equipment
inventories must contain assets that cost $50,000 or more, RTD’s Accounting department
defines an asset as an asset of $5,000 or more with at least a one-year useful life. Capital
asset tags are assigned to equipment assets noted as being an asset in the Fixed Financial
Assets (FFA) register managed by Accounting. Additionally, assets in the equipment class
have importance significant enough to be managed in Trapeze Enterprise Asset Management
(EAM) system. Assets managed in this way are deemed to have special importance to
continued service delivery. At least one of the three criteria above must be met in order for
equipment to be considered an asset in the AMP. Presented in this plan are those assets
included in the AMP and which need to be described in sections three and four of the TAM
requirements. Were the agency to only report on the decision tools and the prioritized list of
investments with the $50,000 threshold, the explanation of what has and will occur would be
incomplete. Given a desire to ensure alignment of agency activities, and to provide
transparency in agency processes, the equipment inventory information presented in this
TAM Plan is guided by the requirements for the AMP, which staff believes to exceed the
requirements outlined in the TAM regulations.
In order to improve the AMP, the AMD worked closely with asset stewards across the agency
to conduct physical inventories of assets. This is viewed as a step forward in improving

information maturity for assets in this class. Expanding both the number of items included
and the quality of the information therein. It is expected that this effort will facilitate
improved management of equipment assets in the future. In addition, RTD will be able to
share more information on equipment assets with its planning partners in the TAM Plan.
Equipment information will continue to include non-revenue vehicles in a manner conforming
to the three NTD categories, which are automobiles, truck and other rubber tire vehicles, and
steel wheel vehicles. Asset information for non-revenue vehicles has been more mature than
for other equipment assets, so no change in how the non-revenue vehicle assets has
occurred for this iteration of TAM reporting. These assets have long been included in the AMP
process.
The inventory of non-revenue vehicle equipment is found in Table 5. This provides detail on
the 48 automobiles, four steel wheel non-revenue vehicles, and 377 rubber tire non-revenue
vehicles in this equipment group. Additional information includes the initial capital cost of the
assets along with the useful life benchmark (ULB), and a score representing the condition of
the equipment based on its age. The score range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the asset
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. An asset that has
reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is considered in
backlog. RTD uses the FTA definition for non-revenue vehicle backlog, which is the
percentage of vehicles that have met or exceeded their useful life benchmark. A non-revenue
vehicle that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).

RTD has historically managed its non-revenue vehicle equipment inventory based on age; the
equipment is procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years
through preventative maintenance and repair, and then replaced.5 As such, condition scores
for non-revenue vehicle equipment are age-based. However, the agency has departed from
planning for age-based renewals of assets in this category while an examination of the
utilization and utility of these assets is underway. Until such time as a new means for
evaluating the utilization and performance of assets in this class, and particularly vehicles
used primarily for administrative purposes, it is the expectation that few renewals will take
place within this class of equipment and vehicles will be knowingly operated in backlog.

Non-vehicle equipment is purchased from a variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated
and maintained by RTD. Non-vehicle equipment consists of various types of machinery used
indirectly in the provision of public transportation services. There is a broad range of assets
reflected in Table 6, from in-plant equipment, to parts management equipment, to
landscaping equipment. A more detailed equipment asset inventory can also be found in
Appendix H. Non-vehicle equipment information gathering exercises are expected to continue
uncovering assets for inclusion into the AMP and TAM Plan within the four-year horizon of
this plan.
Non-vehicle equipment represents a wide variety of assets and are not managed in a uniform
way. While the efforts to improve inventory have yielded results, additional information on
non-vehicle equipment assets will need to be matured in order to develop an effective
management strategy by equipment type. Additional information on ULBs and/or EULs will
also need to be developed to ensure the accuracy of equipment lifespan estimates collected
from third-party resources to ensure that RTD is using the equipment in a manner similar to
those used in establishing the ULB. Strategies other than age-based approaches will require
additional maturity, such as collecting and utilizing data on engine hours in replacement
planning. Within the period of this plan, it is expected that the inventory will further increase
and that an age-based approach to management will be the most common method employed
for asset replacement.

5 Some non-revenue vehicles adopt an ad-hoc approach in which they are replaced after a combination of factors.

Facilities

For the purposes of this TAM Plan, RTD owns:





Five administration facilities where RTD administration functions occur
Nine maintenance facilities where maintenance work occur
121 public facilities, which includes stations, buildings and other structures where
customers can board or alight from an RTD transit vehicle
114 conveyances such as elevators and escalators, installed within facilities (these are
treated here separately based on NTD reporting requirements)

Administration, maintenance, and public facilities for which RTD has capital responsibility are
operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and snow
removal, may be contracted to third parties. Conveyance manufacturers include Kone and
ThyssenKrupp, and conveyance maintenance is outsourced to third parties.

Figure 16: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities and their related equipment on a reactive basis,
i.e., the practice has been to maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical
facility elements, such as underground storage tanks, can have redundancy built in to
minimize service interruptions when they fail to perform as designed.
Since 2015, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of
individual elements of each facility for which RTD has capital responsibility. As such, facility
condition scores are assessment-based. This is based on the Transit Economic Requirements
Model (TERM) scale and is utilized for both TAM and NTD reporting.

6 The agency has not yet been able to determine an appropriate estimated useful life (EUL) for all equipment types. Further
refinement of EULs is expected.
7 Age scores and backlog are dependent on establishing an EUL.

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third parties in accordance with applicable
legislation and regulations but are not used to determine condition. These assets are
managed on an age-based approach consistent with regulatory standards. Both preventive
and reactive maintenance activities are performed by third parties, and the activities
delivered under these contractual agreements are monitored by RTD staff to ensure contract
adherence and acceptable performance of the assets.
Table 8 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their EUL and a score representing the condition of the asset. The table provides

Infrastructure

RTD’s rail infrastructure can most easily addressed in three parts, directly operated light rail,
third party operated commuter rail, and directly operated commuter rail.
RTD owns light rail infrastructure including grade crossings, catenary wire segments, track,
relay cases, switches, and substations, as well as light rail vehicle bridges, and commuter rail
alignments operated and maintained by a third party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed
by a variety of manufacturers and is owned,
operated, and maintained by RTD. RTD has
historically managed light rail infrastructure assets
based on age but did perform condition
assessments of select light rail infrastructure for
three years. In doing so, RTD determined that agebased condition scores provided similar levels of
accuracy as assessment-based condition scores,
and so has stopped performing condition
Figure 21: Track Infrastructure
assessments. As such, light rail infrastructure
condition scores are age-based (Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Seventy-seven light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven light rail
vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by third parties. Light rail vehicle bridges are
inspected once every two years by an independent third-party contractor per state law.
Defects noted in inspections are then addressed through a combination of in-house and
contracted resources, as determined by RTD staff. Though inspection data is obtained from
the third-party the inspection methodology does not conform to the TERM scale. Condition
assessments for bridges owned and maintained by third parties are not recorded in the
TAMP. As a result, the agency relies on age-based scores to communicate the condition of
assets to planning partners.
All commuter rail infrastructure is delivered under the FasTracks program. The operation of
the A, B, and G lines, as well as all commuter rail electrical power substations is outsourced
to DTO. RTD will assume ownership for these commuter rail infrastructure assets at the end
of the contracted period of performance (30 years from inception). Condition assessments
will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility.
In 2020, RTD opened a directly operated commuter rail line, the N Line. This directly
operated commuter rail infrastructure added to the diversity of RTD’s rail assets and is noted

the inventory.
Tables 11 and 12 present the total number of light rail infrastructure assets for which RTD
has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and age-based condition and backlog scores.
Table 13 presents the total number of light rail and directly operated commuter rail vehicle
bridges for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and assessment-based
condition scores.
Table 14A represents the number, EUL, and age-based score for key directly operated
commuter rail assets.
Table 14B represents the original directly operated commuter rail assets as reflected in the
Fixed Financial Assets records.
Table 15 represents the directly operated commuter rail track by type, noting the differences
in EUL between the types and relevant age-based scores.
Tables 16 and 17 represent the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the
percentage of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by light
rail and commuter rail by class, respectively. However, RTD anticipates that the guideway
under performance restriction measure may not be an adequate measure of condition for rail
infrastructure assets in the future (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be placed under a temporary
performance restriction such as routine maintenance, the presence of inspection personnel in
the right of way, or police activity at or near crossings. These reasons provide no indication
of the condition of the assets. Additionally, track assets that are in very poor condition but
that exist in a high-density urban environment may not have a performance restriction
because the design speed is low in such areas. The age of these assets along with physical
inspections will likely be more useful for investment decisions; consequently, RTD also
provides age-based condition and backlog scores for light rail infrastructure assets.
RTD’s first light rail line opened in 1994; assets of that era, with an EUL of 25 years, are
currently shown in backlog in Table 11. However, this may not reflect the true condition of
the assets. Major repairs to assets, such as replacement or refurbishment of components,
renews the life of those assets, such improvements have not been reliably recorded in a
system of record. The Asset Management Division is working with Light Rail Maintenance of
Way and Capital Programs Department to improve asset information and to begin recording
major repairs of assets in a system of record for reporting, compliance, and planning
purposes.
Tables 11, 12, and 13 also present the total initial capital cost for each light rail asset type.
RTD’s first directly operated commuter rail line, the N Line, opened in 2020. The asset
information for this line does not reside in a single system of record. Work has been

performed to improve the inventory quality, but there are incongruences between different
information resources. The costs are commensurate with the level of the capital program,
which are not easily disambiguated to the level of the asset counts by type. To present the
best currently available estimates, directly operated commuter rail assets are presented
separately in tables 14A and 14B. While the information presented in this plan is believed to
be accurate, further refinements are expected to support improvements to the AMP for these
assets.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process

The capital improvement component of RTD’s fiscal policy states that “On an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the
capital and operating programs.” (Regional Transportation District, 2016)
The MTFP also provides the basis for the agency’s application for federal transit funding
through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the
region that receive federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the
qualifying MTFP projects are included in the TIP.
The current renewal and replacement capital investment decision process begins with the
agency AMP. The AMP is a process, as well as a product (Fig. 22) The AMP begins with
information from systems of record, primarily Trapeze EAM and the Fixed Financial Assets
list, but also includes ad-hoc resources such as manual inventories in spreadsheets and

Capital Programs initiatives not tied to specific assets. This collection of information is used to
create an “Initial AMP” which is prepared for asset stewards. The asset stewards then assess
the age-based information and apply their judgement to determine whether to accept or
modify the results of the initial AMP, this is known as the validated AMP. This stage is also
where asset stewards augment information on “fact sheets” that are prepared by the AMD
using the information from the system(s) of record with additional information which will
assist other stewards in appropriately prioritizing the funding requests among other requests.
The prioritized AMP is the result of the annual evaluation of information from the validated
AMP requests by a panel of asset stewards. Each fall the Asset Management Working Group
(AMWG) is convened where asset stewards use the information available to them in the
validated AMP stage to prioritize requests. This results in the prioritized list of investments
shown in Table 20. The prioritized AMP is then compared to available funding for asset
renewals and replacements. Funded requests become part of the budget in the MTFP and the
remainder of the renewal and replacement requests remain in the AMP process for
consideration in future iterations of that process. The AMP process is illustrated in Figure 22
and the relationship of each AMP cycle to the MTFP is shown in Figure 23.

4 List of Prioritized Investments

The output of the current capital investment decision process is a list of prioritized capital
projects. For 2022-2028, the requested renewal and replacement needs are shown in Tables
20A-20G. For ease of presentation, each year of prioritized investments is presented
separately.
Reflecting the annual budget cycle only items in the approved budget are truly funded,
though funds are planned for asset renewals and replacements in the scope of this TAM Plan.
As the agency’s AMP is focused on the renewal and replacement of existing assets, only the
prioritized renewal and replacement needs are reflected in the TAM Plan. Other investments
such as those required to comply with laws, regulations, and legal judgements are
considered obligatory and are addressed outside of the AMP prioritization process.

5 Improving Asset Management Capabilities at RTD

As an agency with a 53-year history, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or
immediate funding shortages that many legacy and larger transit systems have. Historically,
RTD has had the necessary funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its
transit assets in a state of good repair while meeting the growing demand for service.
However, as mentioned in the executive summary, RTD’s backlog of existing assets is
growing and will experience swells of assets achieving their respective EULs, such as those
from pre-FasTracks expansion activities including the original light rail alignment known as
the Metro Area Circulator (MAC) or Central Corridor, the Southwest light rail alignment, the
Southeast rail alignment that was a component of the T-REX project, and the Central Platte
Valley (CPV) extension. The asset renewal and replacement needs are expected to be $453M
for the 2022-2028 planning period (Figure 25). Presently the AMP records reflect a funding
need of over $187 million for 2022, which is largely accounts for the backlog for assets in the
scope of TAM. (Figure 26) The actual funding needs are likely higher due to assets out of
scope of TAM, assets that have yet to be recognized in the AMS, and uncertainty around the
infrastructure and facilities needs that result from a lack of controlled and available asset
information on which to formulate data-driven plans. The known unfunded needs by asset
type are summarized in Figure 27.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a
growing set of decaying assets, but rather by the expansion of the asset base in recent
years. Beginning with the T-REX project and continuing with the current FasTracks project,
over the past 16 years RTD has invested over $6.4 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit
service.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make sufficient provision for the
long-term maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term
renewal plan in place, with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal
projects without adequate funding is too great to be unaddressed. In 2022, the agency
identified funding needs over a long-range planning horizon and determined that funding of
at least $120 million annualized would be required to address the state of good repair needs.
A growing backlog for any transit agency increases risks to safety, service, and future
sustainability; it feeds a pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks. The
AMP process and available funding are tools to ensure the future viability of the assets and
position the agency for providing value to the customers and community the agency serves.
RTD is preparing an AMP that addresses future funding needs for existing assets, prioritizing
renewals over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the agency than
projected future costs. Therefore, RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and increasingly
precise estimates of the investments that are needed over the coming budget planning cycle.
Improvement in AIM will facilitate the agency’s ability to forecast costs, estimate performance
consequences, and understand risk to achieving strategic objectives.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and
beyond. It has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) to summarize
its strategy to improve asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations
have been able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an
aligned AMS. This approach to utilizing an existing asset management framework is a best
practice and is still a focal point for the SAMP.

Typically, organizations begin with a focus on asset information, particularly the inventory of
all their assets and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning,
because this allows the organization to fully assess its assets and their condition. The
intended result is not just a clear plan to cover all the assets but is rather a prioritized and
optimized plan based on understanding the risks to objectives and using this to make the
best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in developing improved inventories and processes to deliver the
AMP, with a particular emphasis on improving inventory information which includes what the
assets are, but also their in-service date, EUL, and cost to round out information needed for
generating an AMP. As discussed elsewhere in this plan, information improvements to
facilitate decision-making for assets is also addressed in the goals set by AMAT and reported
in the SAMP.
The current strategy is to focus on continued improvement of the AMP through AIM
improvement initiatives, utilizing principles of good asset management and tools derived from
ISO 55000 standards, though the agency will not seek certification within the four-year scope
of this TAM Plan. The SAMP is due to be revisited and it is expected that the adjustments
from being focused on ISO 55000 certification to an approach more centered on fundamental
activities that improve the AMP by enhancing AIM.

5.2

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management
activities that RTD performs as part of “business as usual,” and those activities specific to
furthering the development and improvement of the AMP. TAM activities are the subset of
these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these are shown in a third section below.
“Business as Usual” Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management
activities on a routine basis, and these will continue to improve through the TAM Plan
horizon.
This section summarizes those “business as usual” activities, using the Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management (2015) to categorize into six main
blocks. This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well
aligned or integrated at present.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The Planning department periodically conducts demand analysis for its
transit service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for
system optimization, expansion and enhancement. At present, strategic
planning for capital renewals and maintenance volumes is not formally performed, though
RTD anticipates the need to enhance its capabilities in this area through the development of
asset class strategies and an AMP (see next section for details). Although not yet a “business
as usual” activity, in undertaking the development of this TAM Plan, RTD has embarked on
asset management planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is
described in Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to
develop the MTFP. Operations and maintenance decision-making is
performed within each asset owner group but does not currently formally consider or align
with agency objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset
acquisition, which is split between the Capital Programs Department for
commuter rail and facility assets and the Operations Department for
rail, bus and rail infrastructure assets. Maintenance delivery occurs for
each major asset class and includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with
condition assessments where warranted. Some asset classes have a larger focus on
preventative maintenance, while others have more emphasis on corrective maintenance and
maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance delivery is performed by staff, with some
being outsourced. Asset operations are a significant part of RTD’s ongoing activities, and
includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of which are also
outsourced. Improved asset information and a focus on aligning to strategic objectives will
facilitate more effective resourcing strategies that ensure the resources to meet strategic

objectives are allocated. RTD also performs shutdown and outage management of its assets
to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, the agency implements its
fault and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset
Information, including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and
maintenance management, and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite
for related financial information. Other systems including Bentley
Optram and Railroad Software have been added to address the specific requirements of light
rail maintenance of way and directly operated commuter rail maintenance of way (commonly
referred to as North Metro). However, these systems have not been fully integrated into
organization processes.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including
regular reporting to the NTD, and regular data quality assessment and cleansing processes
for Trapeze EAM information. The Asset Management Division employs a data science and
analytics team to support designated asset stewards with collection, management, and
analysis of non-physical data. This group also performs data assurance tasks on corporate
data and performs all FTA TAM report preparation activities.
The RTD data science and analytics team also administers the asset information maturity
(AIM) process, having designed the framework, administered assessments, and provided
significant consultative guidance in the development of AIM improvement plans and
professional support in the execution of many analytics tasks within the plans.
RTD applies procurement and supply chain management principles for
its outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital
delivery of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations
and maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation
and maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced to two service
providers, and the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators, is also
outsourced.
RTD’s Finance department uses standard accounting practices to
perform asset costing and valuation, including their valuation and
deprecation of assets over time. Integration of the ORF into AIM
improvement plans, in the renewal/replacement requests and more
broadly into other operational plans is expected within the period of this TAM Plan.

Asset Management System Activities

In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has
activities defined as part of its 2021–2026 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan identifies the
objective to “[d]esign, implement, maintain and continually improve a functioning, effective,
adequately resourced management system for all physical assets, based on plan-do-checkact principles,” and to “[c]reate and manage the asset management plan to provide a

prioritized list of the agency's asset needs for annual budgeting and the mid-term financial
plan.” (RTD, 2021)
These strategic objectives presently require improvements in AIM to enhance the AMS and
AMP, and therefore much of the AMD’s resources are aimed at delivering information
maturity improvements over the scope of this TAM Plan.

5.2.2.1 Design an Asset Management Organization

This includes the implementation of an AMS that meets the agency’s strategic needs: the
framework to define and manage the key elements, including a policy, strategy and risk
management framework, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

5.2.2.2 Asset Management Planning

This includes the development of asset class strategies and an AMP as key elements of an
investment planning process.

5.2.2.3 Improve Rigor and Control

This implements improved control over core asset delivery and financial activities and
includes improved information to aid in accurate and precise financial planning to meet the
agency’s strategic needs, not limited to those items with a particular asset management
focus in the strategic plan.

5.2.2.4 Assurance and Performance

In order to deliver on the AMAT goal of achieving an Optimized AMP, an improved
performance management framework aligned to measure those things most critical to
delivery of the agency’s strategic plan will be required. It is not anticipated that a unified
organization-wide asset performance framework will be delivered within the scope of this
four-year TAM Plan. However, improved asset performance measures may be a component
of AIM initiatives in the coming years.

5.2.2.5 Enhance Asset Information

This is centered on the development and implementation of an AIM framework, including
definition of RTD’s information requirements and the strategies employed for meeting them,
along with clear governance for asset information. Without changes in organizational
structure, it is not anticipated that a unified, organization-wide asset register will be delivered
within the scope of this four-year TAM Plan.

5.2.2.6 Learning and Communication

This is to support the embedding of asset management awareness, culture and
competencies, and includes a training needs analysis and a program of appropriate asset
management training, as well as communication to raise awareness of asset management
throughout the organization, and the development of an appropriate asset management
culture.

Staff resources from across the agency are involved in RTD’s asset management activities,
including the GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division, and the
Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications, Planning, and
General Counsel departments.

Business as Usual Asset Management activities

The resourcing strategy for the “business as usual” annual asset management activities will
continue with the current strategy, i.e. resourcing the activities through the agency
departments that currently perform or are involved in them.

Asset Management System Activities

The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan requires the establishment of a functioning, effective,
sufficiently resourced management system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish
clear accountability and responsibility for the Asset Management System, with the authority
to direct and allocate resources being granted to the accountable group. The diagram below
illustrates the accountability structure and other contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two employees the task of building an Asset Management
Division (AMD). The Division would eventually be responsible for improving the management
of assets and building an agency-wide AMS.
To ensure the most accurate, non-biased information possible, the Leadership Team
determined the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
According to Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert: “Strategic Asset
Management calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term

thinking. It needs clarity on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about
performance” (Johnson and Lloyd, 2012).
The AMD was recently placed in the Finance department to facilitate greater alignment to
supporting the agency’s financial planning needs through delivery of the AMP processes and
products. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD staff possess a wealth of asset management expertise, as a number of its
employees transferred from other areas of the agency, bringing with them significant
knowledge of agency operations, experience in maintenance of many asset classes, physical
asset business analysis, and/or data science. External hires provided additional subject
matter expertise, knowledge, skills, and abilities.

TAM Activities

The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an accountable executive
for all TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the AMD. Supporting resources
from other agency departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed
basis. Details of both the accountable executive and the AMD are in Appendix E.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives each triennial
audit.
However, the plan is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of
intentions and commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary
for the improved efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the agency.
RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its
SAMP. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies, allowing RTD
to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan
improvement goals and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress
(Regional Transportation District, 2021).

Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate
responsibility for carrying out the safety management system of a public
transportation agency; responsibility for carrying out transit asset management
practices; and control or direction over the human and capital resources needed to
develop and maintain both the agency's public transportation agency safety plan, in
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's transit asset management plan
in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Asset Information Maturity (AIM) – This consists of a framework, an assessment,
AIM plans, and updates to the Asset Management Accountability Team on progress
towards stated objectives in plans. The framework that includes a six-stage model
indicating relative maturity that are mutually exclusive based on the availability of
information, the quality of data in its utility for decision-making/planning, the
presence or absence of a documented plan/procedure for the development and
utilization of data suitable for decision-making/planning, whether or not documented
plans/procedures are followed and monitored for adherence, and whether a ‘plan-docheck-act’ cycle of continuous improvement is applied to tune information and plan
quality to achieve organization objectives. The inventory consists of 24 items based
on ISO 55000 clauses 7.5 and 7.6 regarding information and its control. The plans are
signed documents available on the RTD intranet.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to
replace any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor)
to 5 (excellent) scale, or 2.5 for assets using age-based replacement or renewal
strategies including rolling stock, equipment, and infrastructure. For facilities,
condition inspections resulting in a score of 3 or less on the TERM scale shall be
considered to be in backlog.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets not included in the FasTracks
system. The Base System is supported in part by a 0.6% sales and use tax. Base
System funding and FasTracks funding are tracked separately.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition
assessments for assets that they own or jointly own with another entity, that they are
responsible for replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on
that asset, or for which the cost of those activities is itemized as a capital line item in
the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Service – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement
between RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Data Driven Decisions - The process of making organizational decisions based on
actual and verifiable data rather than intuition or observation alone. The approach
includes problem solving where a well-defined set of actions are driven by decisions
which are further driven by insights (extracted from data) using sound methods.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Denver’s metropolitan
planning organization (MPO). https://drcog.org/

Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those
services provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those
operated under contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted
Service.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is agency-defined as opposed to FTA
established Useful Life Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major
renewal or replacement is expected.
FasTracks – FasTracks is a ballot initiative that levied an additional 0.4% sales tax
for expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well
as a Public Private Partnership (P3) to the system.
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind.
Prior to the establishment of this standard, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS55) was published by the British Standards Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The
ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards was formalized in 2014 and is
composed of three parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, Principles and Terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the Application of ISO 55001
Leadership Team (LT) – Agency leaders who hold the title of Chiefs and/or Assistant
General Managers that lead departments and/or operating modalities
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112141) was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.
Mid-Term Financial Plan or MTFP – A portion of RTD’s total budget not already
committed to specific capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing operations and
maintenance that is evaluated and prioritized through a process described in Section 3
of this document.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies
receiving Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding, which serves as a primary
repository for all transit-related data and statistics in the United States. The
performance data from the NTD is used to allocate FTA funding and to report on
public transit performance to Congress and researchers.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at
a full level of performance.” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database,
2016)
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a
numeric code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERMLite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the
agency-defined Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset,
major renewal or replacement is expected.

Appendix B: SGR Master Condition Rating Definitions for
RTD
RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an
asset or component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater
granularity than a half point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual
asset group Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific
examples.
Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life
5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage, cosmetically
looks new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and therefore the highest
score after rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to <95% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to <90% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Shows minimal
signs of wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to <80% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to <70% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Some
moderately defective or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically ‘fair’ but
all devices are functioning as designed.
Small repairs or minor refurbishment.
2.5) The inspector is 50% to <60% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to <50% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset near
overhaul or retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of defects or
deteriorated component(s).
Significant or multiple repairs needed.
1.5) The inspector is 30% to <40% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset is in need
of major repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of corrosion may be
apparent; major or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement.

duration of the plan horizon:






Staff resources
o One accountable executive
o Fifteen to twenty FTEs from the Asset Management Division, who will split
their time between tasks associated with the AMP process and AIM initiative
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support asset management
across the agency. RTD’s aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in
new ones at this time.
o Hardware and software necessary to support:
 Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
 Data warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
 Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and
others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as
usual’ activities, TAM and ISO implementation. Beyond these, RTD has not
defined any requirement for further resources for this generation of the TAM
Plan.

Officer, and Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs.
3. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – reporting directly the Accountable Executive, the
CFO chairs AMAT. This position is critical to developing an asset management culture.
In this role the CFO ensures the alignment of asset management initiatives to
strategic objectives. By having a robust understanding of agency needs, this
individual can guide the agency in the development, implementation and maintenance
of an AMS that enhances agency capabilities. This individual also ensures adequate
resourcing for the AMS overall, and the AMD.
4. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery,
embedding, review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s
(AMS) products, processes and information. The AMD manages the AMP and AIM
initiatives. The Asset Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Financial
Officer.
5. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted
or informed regarding the AMS. This could include operations, maintenance, finance,
safety, human resources, communications, IT, capital programs, legal, and
procurement staff. The AMAT will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line or via a request to other members of the Leadership Team when they
are not.
6. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal
asset management competencies of both the AMD and other RTD resources involved
with the AMS. The alternative to this is to be continually reliant on an external entity
to supply expertise indefinitely. By having actions guided by both an established asset
management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate
an AMD capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the agency. The
intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external
resources will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the AMS, specifically the operations
and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet and a large portion of the
commuter rail system.

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit system. In 1989, the Colorado
Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional Transportation District was eligible to collect a use tax that
enabled the District to accumulate funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991. Construction on the initial 5.3-mile
rail system and a functional operations facility began without federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of September 1994, and the system
opened for revenue service with 11 light rail vehicles on October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities, and vehicles were added
in subsequent years with voter support, as detailed below.

I 5.1.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables. Light rail transit currently carries roughly 40,000
customers daily. Trains operate as one-, two-, three-, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the light rail transit system safely, reliably, and efficiently and
to integrate light rail operation with bus service for the greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the
integration of transportation services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion,
and improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3-mile Central Corridor, the 8.7-mile Southwest Corridor, the 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley Spur, the 19-mile Southeast Corridor, the 12.1-mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5-mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6mile Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). The system has six operating lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.

I 5.1.2

Organizational Structure

The light rail transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and Maintenance center. Thus, the
lines of communication between safety and light rail operations are effective. Key positions with light rail operations are:
•

Assistant General Manager, Rail

•

Deputy Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations

I 5.1.3

Light Rail Corridors

Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system is operated by Denver’s
Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit system, which includes local bus routes, express
bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes, and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor comprises 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations, including three ark-n-rRde locations. The Central
Corridor operates at grade level except for one fly-over structure for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial
fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service,
six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th Avenue and Downing
Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway
Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center, and Union
Station transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th Street Mall shuttles include the
Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, federal courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center,
State Capitol, Denver Art Museum, Denver Public Library, History Colorado Center, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio communication, operational
procedures, and train orders govern operators regarding all vehicle movement. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit
signage, and wayside signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection traffic signals, while the
at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates with flashers and warning bells. The crossings at
13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and maintained by Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize automated fare equipment for ticket sales and ticket validation. Transit Security
Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving rail supervisors, contracted security officers, and local
police departments provide platform security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad switching yard near
6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads
at either end of the storage yard, allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes
a yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support maintenance. Central
Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational governing authority for all mainline vehicle
movement. Central Control personnel (controller/supervisors) direct, control, and monitor revenue-service operations
using radio, telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule timetable
and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules, rules, and procedures. Controllers
implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment
failures, emergency situations, or weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance, and nonrevenue maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops location.
The corridor begins on the south end with I-25 and Broadway Station. I-25 and Broadway station provides a major bus and
light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding
north a short distance is Alameda Station. After leaving Alameda Station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then
ascend the Santa Fe/Kalamath flyover structure, returning to grade as the alignment passes the Mariposa facility before
entering 10th and Osage Station. From 10th and Osage, trains pass through the 13th Avenue crossing and then either travel
downtown (Central Corridor) or to the Central Platte Valley (CPV) Corridor. Continuing northeast on the Central Corridor
is Colfax at Auraria Station, which allows direct access to the Auraria Campus via a plaza and a bus transfer point. After
leaving Colfax at Auraria Station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer Boulevard,
crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to Convention Center Station near 14th and Stout streets.

At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along
Stout Street between 14th and 19th streets. Two passenger stations are located on Stout, one at 16th Street and one at
18th Street. The inbound track along California Street travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction from 14th to 19th
streets, servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the 16th Street Mall, then continuing on the
single track northeast bound to the next passenger station, at 18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th Street, where it joins the track to Welton Street and where the double track travels
east on Welton Street to the 20th Street and Welton Station, located between 19th and 20th streets on Welton. The double
track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th
and 25th streets, the double track configuration transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it
continues northeast on Welton and proceeds to the 25th Street and Welton Station, located near 26th Street. Traveling
northeast along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th
streets, then transitions back into a double track configuration as it enters the 30th Aand Downing northern terminus station.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7-mile extension of the Central Corridor light
rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end-of-line station at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. It
includes five light rail stations: Evans, Englewood, Oxford•City of Sheridan, Littleton•Downtown, and Littleton•Mineral. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride, with the exception of Oxford.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a maximum speed of 55 mph. The
corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa
Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight
spur crossing at the Evans station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance
patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue,
and on the west side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate
grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks: one near Tufts Avenue, where the east/west transition
occurs; and one near Iowa, where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound, the tracks cross over Mississippi Avenue on a bridge and continue
south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after crossing Iowa Avenue, the alignment rises on the Iowa flyover
structure to pass over a freight rail spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the
trackway returns to grade, the tracks pass under Evans Avenue and enter the Evans station. Continuing south from Evans
station, the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before crossing a bridge over Dartmouth
Avenue and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden
Avenue and continue to Oxford Station. From Oxford Station south, the alignment passes over Oxford Avenue and then
climbs the Tufts flyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the west side.
Descending off the flyover, the alignment passes over Belleview Avenue on a bridge before entering a below grade cut and
Littleton•Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station, the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the
end-of-line Littleton•Mineral Station.
An additional 14 light rail vehicles were added to the existing fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles
are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility
was expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar
to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, 18
additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL_FINAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.b

The Central Platte Valley (CPV) corridor is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing Central Corridor light rail
line at Colfax Avenue to Denver Union Station. This is a double track alignment along the entire corridor, including the CPV
junction.
Packet Pg. 709

The CPV corridor begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (the location where the existing Central Corridor
light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax
Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and
parallels 5th Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and enters Empower
Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline (freight), to the Ball Arena•Elitch
Gardens Station, then continues north and ends at Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new administration
building of the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing “Sports Walk” that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving Ball Arena and Elitch Gardens; and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active warning devices for control
and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at Ball Arena, Coors Field and Empower Field at Mile
High, special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as every four to five minutes between the event
venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special event trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Littleton•Mineral and RidgeGate Parkway end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. It consists of 21 miles of double-tracked light rail
transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station and ending at RidgeGate Parkway Station. This includes an alignment
along I-225 in the median, from I-25 to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana•Pearl; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe at Village Center; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Sky Ridge;
Lone Tree City Center; RidgeGate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were constructed at 2701 S. Elati
St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of light rail vehicles and associated support needs that
accompanied the system expansion. North and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline
track just north of Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of 2006, the
Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a heavy maintenance and repair shop,
while still maintaining the Control Center on the second floor.
The Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) opened for revenue service in May 2019. This extended double track rail service 1.6
miles from the former end-of-line station at Lincoln to the new end-of-line station at RidgeGate Parkway. Two additional
stations, Sky Ridge and Lone Tree City Center, are located on the extension.

Broadway to Colorado
The Southeast Corridor alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing Broadway station, allowing vehicles
from the Southeast Corridor to access both the Southwest Corridor and existing light rail line to central downtown.
Following the wye tracks, the alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After crossing
Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on-ramp and drops down to match the grade of I-25
and into Louisiana•Pearl station. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross streets, maintaining a 17-foot vertical
clearance above the top of rail. Through the Narrows (Broadway to University), the alignment parallels I-25 between I-25’s
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the highway bridges
through a separate light rail bridge structure and enter University Station.
At the University interchange, the alignment moves away from I-25, runs along the outside edge of the University off-ramp,
and rises up to pass over University on the aerial structure. After crossing University, the alignment continues along the outside
edge of the University on-ramp, returning to an alignment adjacent to the I-25 shoulder and at the same grade as the highway.

Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel
section. After passing under Colorado, the alignment remains below grade in an open trench section, enters Colorado
Station and again parallels I-25. After leaving the station, it passes under Evans in a tunnel section.

Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the alignment rises to return to the highway grade, running adjacent to the highway into Yale
Station. At Yale Avenue, the alignment runs along the edge of the Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the alignment follows along the west side of I-25 to Hampden Avenue. At Hampden, the alignment enters a
very short tunnel section under Hampden, returns to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden, and enters Southmoor
Station.
Continuing south, the alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I-225 freeway
interchange. Special track work at this location allows for a wye connection to the light rail alignment located along I-225.
These connecting tracks are primarily at-grade and pass below the I-25/I-225 interchange.

Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the alignment passes under Union Avenue along the west edge of I-25.
After passing under Union Avenue, the alignment continues south into Belleview Station. After leaving the station, it travels
along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure. Continuing south from Belleview, the alignment runs adjacent to
I-25 to Orchard Station, where it again shifts out along the ramps and then over Orchard Road on an aerial structure. South
of Orchard, the alignment returns to the west edge of the highway into Arapahoe at Village Center Station. From the station
continuing south, the alignment rises to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long aerial structure.

Arapahoe Road to RidgeGate Parkway
South of Arapahoe Road, the alignment continues adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to Dry Creek Station. From Dry Creek
Station, the alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek,
the alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to County Line Road, where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line
Road on an aerial structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange, the
alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 into County Line Station. South of the station, the alignment enters the C-470/
E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the alignment travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over C-470, around the
western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I-25, where it continues south into Lincoln Station. After leaving
Lincoln Station, the alignment continues south and passes over Lincoln Avenue on an aerial structure and then turns east
into Sky Ridge Station. The lone at grade crossing on the Southeast Corridor, Trainstation Circle crossing, is at the south
end of Sky Ridge Station. The alignment then crosses over I-25 on an aerial structure and turns south into Lone Tree City
Center Station. From the station, it continues over RidgeGate Parkway on an aerial structure and into the end-of line-station.

I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I-25 alignment through a wye
connection, allowing light rail vehicles to connect to both the northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 alignment. After
the wye connection, the alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The alignment continues in the I-225
median into Dayton Station. From Dayton Station, the alignment continues east into Nine Mile Station at Parker Road.
The corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors, including traction power substations and signal
systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project and is retrofitted into the existing system.
Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April 2013, extending from Denver
Union Station to the Jefferson County Government Center. The alignment runs through Denver, Lakewood, and Golden.
The West Rail Line has 12 stations: Auraria West, Decatur•Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Lakewood•Wadsworth,
Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red Rocks College, and Jefferson County Government Center•Golden.
The alignment is double track from Denver Union Station to Federal Center Station and is single track from Federal Center
Station to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station. Total travel time from Denver Union Stationto Jefferson
County Government Center•Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station, the alignment travels to the Ball Arena•Elitch Gardens Station, Empower Field at Mile
High Station, and Auraria West Station.
Departing from the Auraria West Station, the alignment passes through the Central Corridor and CPV junction and curves
south under Colfax Avenue, where it crosses over the Consolidated Main Line (CML) on an aerial structure. The alignment
turns to the west on this structure before returning to grade and passing under I-25. From the I-25 viaduct, it continues west
through the Zuni Street at grade crossing and over the South Platte River on a bridge structure. After it crosses the river, it
passes through the Decatur Street at grade crossing and into Decatur•Federal Station.
From Decatur•Federal Station, the train continues west on the alignment under the Federal Bridge, following Lakewood
Gulch through the Knox Court crossing into Knox Station. Leaving Knox Station, the alignment curves south towards 10th
Avenue, following Dry Gulch and continuing west to the Perry Street crossing and Perry Station. The alignment continues
west through a gated crossing for the bike path at Wolff Street and into Sheridan Station under Sheridan Boulevard.
Departing Sheridan Station, the alignment curves north to run alongside 13th Avenue and west through Harlan crossing into
Lamar Station. Traveling west through the Lamar, Pierce, and Teller crossings, the track then ascends an aerial structure into
the next station, Lakewood•Wadsworth. Leaving Wadsworth station and descending the bridge, the alignment continues
west through Carr Street and Estes Street crossings and into Garrison Station.
Continuing west, the alignment passes through Garrison Street and Independence Street crossings, passes over the Kipling
Street Bridge, then proceeds through the Oak Street crossing into Oak Station.
From Oak Station, the alignment curves south at Quail Street and Collins Avenue crossings and follows Simms Street to the
8th Avenue crossing before passing over 6th Avenue on the 6th Avenue Bridge. It then continues south through the North
Avenue crossing and turns west into Federal Center Station. Some trains turn back here to return to Denver Union Station,
utilizing the pocket track, while others continue to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station.
Departing Federal Center Station and continuing to Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station, the alignment
curves north and becomes single track prior to passing through the 4th Avenue crossing. The alignment continues to 6th
Avenue, turns west and proceeds through the Union Boulevard tunnel, and continues west along the south side of 6th
Avenue into the Red Rocks College Station, where it splits into double track.
Departing Red Rocks College Station, the alignment becomes single track again and continues west along 6th Avenue. The
alignment curves north and then back west as it crosses the Indiana Street Bridge flyover to the north side of 6th Avenue,
where the alignment continues. It goes through the tunnel under I-70, passes over Colfax on an aerial structure, then
proceeds through the Ulysses Street and Earl Johnson Road crossings before entering one of three tracks at the end-of-line
station, Jefferson Countye Government Center•Golden.

I-225 Rail Corridor

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024_FINAL_DIGITAL_FINAL (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

17.G.b

The I-225 project added 10.5 miles to the light rail system within the city of Aurora, providing key regional connections to
the East and Southeast rail lines. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to the
public in February 2017 as the R Line, and it features eight stations: , Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd Ave•Abilene,
13th Ave, Colfax, Fitzsimons, and Peoria. This corridor extends light rail service north from Nine Mile Station to Peoria
Station, where customers can connect to commuter rail to access Denver International Airport.
Packet Pg. 712

I 5.1.4

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system
provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements from the Central Control Center, and system
monitoring and status information to the Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain
capabilities such as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches. It also
provides information to light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail system and train information.
SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal status, and a variety of additional
system information.

I 5.1.5

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD 160. The vehicles are very
similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC propulsion system and sliding plug doors, whereas the
SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the
operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As ridership grew, so
did the system beyond the Central Corridor, triggering orders of new LRVs. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle,
and there are 49 of these vehicles in the fleet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68
were delivered, with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An additional
29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018. RTD now has a total fleet of 201 vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, singlearticulated, double-ended, bidirectional, high-floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches
in width, and 13 feet high, and they operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
by 750 volts of direct current from an overhead wire and capable of speeds up to 55 mph. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and accommodate up to 61 additional standing passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be
accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize
the level of comfort with which customers are afforded for their trip. In addition, light rail vehicles are equipped with HVAC
and good lighting configuration.

I 5.1.6

Operations

The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and SCADA,
governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact with the train operators by
means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they
have to leave the cab or there is a radio failure. Controllers/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their
role is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an emergency
or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and
investigation.
Current operations consist of six lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.. The D Line extends from Littleton•Mineral Station to 18th and
California Station. The E Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Denver Union Station.. The H Line extends
from Florida Station to 18th and California Station. The L Line is a downtown loop between 14th and Stout streets and
30th•Downing Station. The W Line extends from Jefferson County Government Center•Golden to Denver Union Station.
The R Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for special events. Early morning or late night headways on weekends
and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or a breakdown of the system, the Control Center controls train movement using a manual block
system. When necessary, bus shuttles are used to move passengers around a trouble area.

Bus Operations System Description

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 and became an
operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency was to provide a regional approach to public
transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting a half percent sales tax and became fully operational. RTD initially inherited 321
buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was 9 million miles per year, with fewer than 20 million
customers annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance capacity for buses in the
small system operating in the District. These systems served several local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder
bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six fragmented bus systems that had
provided service to different areas of the District were integrated into a single, unified system. New and improved service
became the focal points for future growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes; new local and express routes; more frequent service; new nighttime
service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas of the District; exclusive bus lanes; and the inauguration
of special service for the elderly and disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to serve the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors led to a significant increase
in ridership.

17.G.b

To support and encourage new customers, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n-Ride facilities. Additional bus
maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the growing bus fleet.
Packet Pg. 714

The 16th Street Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit concept, which would
pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and provide opportunities for additional suburban
service.
In 1994, RTD partnered with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to add High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
lanes from I-25 to US 36, allowing regional and express routes running along US 36 and I-25 to downtown Denver to
bypass congestion around the Turnpike Tangle.
In 2016, RTD began operating the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along US 36 and the I-25 HOV lanes,
seamlessly connecting Boulder and Denver. Later that year, RTD began operation of 36 BYD K10MR all-electric buses on
the 16th Street Mall, making it one of the largest electric bus fleets in the nation. The District has evolved into a transit
system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It serves 40 municipalities in all or part of eight counties. The system
comprises 148 routes. The fleet currently has 1,011 buses, of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently
four maintenance and storage facilities Districtwide, 77 Park-n-Rides, and six transfer stations.

I 5.3.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the fixed route bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and off-peak
hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of 200,827 weekday boardings.
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station are the main transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The bus transit safety specialist’s office is located at RTD headquarters, at 1660 Blake St. in Denver. Key positions within
bus operations are the assistant general manager of bus operations, deputy assistant general manager of bus operations,
general superintendent of bus transportation, , general superintendent of bus maintenance, and general superintendent of
street supervision, Manager of contracted service, and business program manager. All of these key positions have regular
contact with the bus transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control, and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch maintains control with
bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and Global Positioning System (GPS). Street Supervisors
also carry portable radios in the event of a system failure. Street Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations.
Their role is to provide support and coordination between dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Bus transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable, and efficient service to all areas served by our
mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from three operating divisions with732 full-time and 93
part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to ensure the safe, efficient, on-time delivery of
scheduled bus service. The district also provides continuous evaluation of routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters, and
facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles. Information is received and
relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination for bus operations. Communication is provided
through the radio system, telephones, and a state-of-the-art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, which operate approximately 58% of RTD’s fixed
route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit centers, transfer stations, and customer care. The District also
coordinates special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and street supervisors will
coordinate bus activities.

Promulgation Statement
The Regional Transportation District's Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), including all annexes
and appendices provides a comprehensive, flexible framework for system-wide emergency
management affecting the agency and is effective as of the date signed by the General
Manager and CEO.
The EOP addresses the roles and responsibilities of emergency management of departments
within RTD, as well as partner agencies, and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial,
tribal, and private organizations and resources that may be called upon to assist and participate
in response to incidents that occur throughout RTD’s service area.
The EOP was developed using recognized state and federal guidance that includes: Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Target Capabilities List; FEMA Core Capabilities;
FEMA’s National Preparedness Frameworks; the National Incident Management System (NIMS);
FEMA’s Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101; FEMA CPG 201; the Colorado
Emergency Management Program Guide; and relevant laws and authorities pertinent to
emergency management in Public Transportation.
The EOP is designed to minimize the disruption of the agency’s core function by establishing a
system of collaboration during times of significant disruption. To meet this goal, it is imperative
that RTD, partner, and stakeholder agencies, and their personnel prepare, train, exercise,
equip, and execute their required roles and responsibilities in accordance with this EOP.
Signed this 19th day of July, 2023

Introduction
Recognizing that significantly disruptive events can occur anytime and have far-reaching
impacts, RTD has developed the following Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) to guide response
activities and ensure effective and efficient coordination. The EOP enhances the agency’s ability
to help prevent, prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against all hazards that
threaten RTD and its customers, employees, resources, equipment, and surrounding
environment.
RTD’s service area is exposed to a number of hazards, discussed later in this document and
within the hazard-specific plans in Annexes G-N. The EOP includes information for the
preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation for an all-hazards approach to emergency
management. In addition, the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP, 2023) identifies systems to
maintain the operations of RTD despite disruption and may be a useful reference during
emergencies. Further, the Cybersecurity Incident Response Procedure (CIMP, 2022) outlines
how RTD will respond to a malicious attack upon its information technology infrastructure and is
included in this document as Annex K. The Commuter Rail Division also maintains the RTDC
Passenger Train Emergency Preparedness Plan, included in this document as Annex B.
The EOP utilizes emergency management principles such as a whole community planning
process and will incorporate partnerships with governmental entities and the private sector.
Emergency management principles are designed to include individuals with access and
functional needs, such as mobility challenges, limited English proficiency as well as any agerelated need.
RTD will activate the EOP when the agency must respond to an emergency that requires
coordination across transit modes and agency functions and with local, state, federal, territorial,
and tribal governmental entities. In addition, RTD may activate the EOP to coordinate support
for a pre-planned event.
The EOP addresses the roles and responsibilities of departments within RTD, as well as partner
agencies, and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, and private organizations
and resources that may be called upon to assist and participate in response to incidents that
occur throughout the locations that may default to this EOP pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. § 2433.5-707.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan

Packet Pg. 753

17.G.b

Purpose
The purpose of the EOP is to establish the necessary framework to support a coordinated
response to all incidents across the agency and RTD’s Service area as it relates to RTD service
including federal, state, and local governmental entities as well as private sector organizations.
It assigns roles and responsibilities for all RTD departments and divisions for preparedness and
response activities before, during, and after an emergency. It also provides for the systematic
integration of additional emergency resources but does not replace other federal, state, or
national emergency operations plans or procedures. Further, it does not remove responsibility
for each line of service (Bus Operations, Light Rail, Commuter Rail, Paratransit, Transit Police,
and Facilities) within RTD to develop their own procedures, policies, and standard operating
procedures for managing emergencies.
The EOP is comprised of a base plan and supporting annexes, appendices, policies, and
procedures. The base plan establishes the structure and provides guidance for a timely and
coordinated response, internal communications, information gathering, information sharing,
decision-making, and roles and responsibilities for coordinating incident operations. The
annexes, appendices, procedures, and policies provide the tools that support the
implementation of the base plan. The EOP is drafted to be adaptable to any situation in which
RTD responds to an emergency regardless of the level of severity and outlines how to prevent,
prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the potential hazards identified within RTD’s
service area.
Further, this plan prescribes the activities to be taken by RTD’s leadership to protect the lives of
customers, employees, property and environment in the event of a natural, human-caused, or
technological emergency, including acts of terrorism.

Scope
This plan applies to all agency operations within the service area and all staff and property
owned by the agency.
Each department and division listed in the EOP is responsible for understanding its own
emergency authority and procedures when implementing the provisions of the EOP.

Situation
RTD was created in the General Assembly of the State of Colorado in 1969 by Chapter 231
Laws of Colorado 1969, currently codified part 1 of article 9 of title 32, Colorado Revised
Statutes to provide mass transportation to the inhabitants of the region. RTD is governed by a
15-member, publicly elected Board of Directors, with each Director representing approximately
200,000 constituents within their respective district.
RTD operates in eight counties with coverage of the entirety of Denver, Broomfield, and
Jefferson Counties and partial coverage in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas, and Weld
Counties. These counties contain 40 municipalities. RTD’s service area covers 2,342 square
miles populated by more than 3 million people.
RTD’s operates bus, light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit services. Rail operates on fixed
alignments with RTD owning or leasing rights of way. Three of the four commuter rail
alignments are operated by Denver Transit Operators/Partners. All light rail, and the N Line of
commuter rail are entirely operated by RTD. Bus service is provided through fixed route, bus
rapid transit, and on-demand service, accomplished with roughly 50 percent of buses operated
by contractors. Fixed routes are reviewed three times annually to make adjustments for
changing landscape and efficiency. Paratransit is entirely on-demand with all service delivery
provided by contractors. There are 9,750 bus stops along 140 bus routes, 113 miles of rail
service including 78 stations along 10 rail lines, and 96 Park-n-Ride facilities. Denver Union
Station (DUS) is the central hub of the system, with A, B, G, and N commuter rail and E and W
light rail lines terminating there. Amtrak trains are also dispatched into DUS.
The agency includes the RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, which
enforces RTD policies and procedures and protects the safety of RTD customers and
employees. This is the only department within RTD with traditional first response
responsibilities.
RTD’s service area includes Denver International Airport, which is the third busiest passenger
airport in the world and a critical resource for the provision of emergency supplies. The airport
is serviced by the A Line commuter rail service, which connects the airport to DUS, as well as
AB1, AT/ATA, 104L, 145X, and 169L buses. In addition, the service area includes portions of
interstates 70, 76, 25, and 225. Major thoroughfares also include E-470, US 6, US 36, US 285,
and US 287/I-70 Business Corridor.
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway and Union Pacific railroads are the main freight rail
operators in the service area, at times running parallel to RTD rail.
RTD also participates in the North Central Region/Urban Area Security Initiative (NCR/UASI) to
coordinate preparedness activities with the surrounding counties and municipalities.

Threat, Hazard, and Vulnerability Analysis
RTD’s service area is vulnerable to a number of natural, technological, and human-caused
threats and hazards. A high-level threat and hazard identification and risk assessment was
conducted utilizing available information about past events, future trends due to changing
climate, and assessment about predicted impacts from various staff across the agency
representing all departments. The assessment was derived from a survey asking respondents to
rank hazards by likelihood, impact, and resilience. Responses from all sources were aggregated
and a matrix created to rank hazards into high, moderate, and low significance to RTD. Those
of interest are presented below:

Critical Facilities and Infrastructure Summary
The sole energy provider for RTD’s service area is Xcel Energy. Power is provided for facilities
both public and private and for the provision of power for rail service.
Light rail alignments are served by 64 substations along the alignments that convert power
from 13,200 V AC to 850 V DC, which is provided through the Overhead Catenary System
(OCS). Where possible these substations are fed by diverse energy grids and there is resiliency
of the system in such that the loss of one to two substations would not adversely impact service
delivery.
Commuter rail alignments are served by two substations, Sundown and Argo. These substations
supply power at 25 kV AC through the OCS. The entire commuter rail system is able to function
drawing power from a single substation.
Water in the service area is provided by Denver Water District, Aurora Water, Bear Creek
Water, Boulder Water, Broomfield Water, Golden Water, Consolidated Water, Daniels Sanitation
District, Douglas County Water, East Cherry Creek Valley Water, Englewood Water, Fruitdale
Water, Green Mountain Water, Ken-Caryl Water, Lafayette Water, Lakewood Water, Left Hand

Planning Assumptions

12

•

RTD is not the primary public safety agency with jurisdiction at its locations throughout
the service area and will collaborate with local police, fire, and emergency medical
personnel to conduct critical life-safety response operations to save lives, reduce or
treat injuries, and to protect property and the environment

•

RTD, the communities within the service area, and state governmental agencies have
effective prediction and warning systems in place allowing RTD to anticipate certain
emergency situations that may impact the agency

•

When anticipating or in response to an emergency situation, the General Manager and
CEO (GM/CEO) and Chief of Police and Emergency Management are responsible for
taking action, including the activation of this plan, to mitigate impacts, save lives,
protect property and the environment, assist survivors, and restore services and
facilities

•

RTD board members, GM/CEO leadership team, supervisors, represented and nonrepresented employees, and partners are familiar with the EOP, understand their roles
and responsibilities under the EOP, maintain appropriate plans, policies, and procedures
to carry out those responsibilities; and maintain a state of readiness. Day-to-day
functions which do not contribute directly to emergency operations may be suspended
for the duration of an emergency/disaster. Resources that would normally be required
for those daily functions may be redirected to tasks in support of the emergency
response

•

RTD will use its own resources in response to an emergency or disaster. Once agency
resources are exhausted (or near exhausted), requests for assistance will be made

•

A large-scale emergency or disaster may overwhelm available agency resources, leading
to the need for support from local/mutual aid jurisdictions, private sector partners, state
agencies, and the federal government

•

When resources of RTD are fully committed and mutual aid from communities within
the service area is exhausted, the Colorado Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management (CDHSEM) may coordinate the provision of additional
assistance to address unmet needs

•

Disaster support from federal agencies may take at least 72 hours to arrive

•

Facilities required to file Tier II hazardous materials reports develop, coordinate, and
provide copies of emergency plans annually to the relevant jurisdiction’s LEPC, fire
department and/or other state departments and agencies as applicable and required by
codes, laws, regulations or requirements

•

In the event that an evacuation of a community within RTD’s service area, or any part
thereof, is ordered, the majority of the evacuees will utilize their own transportation

resources to evacuate. However, a percentage of the population does not have access
to transportation and will require transportation assistance
•

Individuals with pets will bring their pets with them when they evacuate. Those with
livestock or other farm animals will take appropriate measures to safeguard their
animals via sheltering or evacuation as appropriate

•

RTD and its response partners will need to provide additional/enhanced assistance to
individuals with access and functional needs, including but not limited to children,
elderly, those with limited English proficiency, and individuals with disabilities and/or
chronic conditions

Concept of Operations
The concept of operations describes the sequence and scope of emergency response. The
Transit Police and Emergency Management Department has the primary responsibility for
coordinating emergency management activities under the auspices of RTD. These activities
support the following priorities:
•

Minimize injury and loss of life

•

Minimize property damage

•

Minimize adverse environmental and economic impact

•

Maintain the highest level of service possible to maintain consistency throughout
emergency conditions

•

Provide for the needs of survivors

Plan Activation
The EOP and its associated annexes will be executed in whole or in part as directed by the
General Manager and CEO, the Chief of Transit Police and Emergency Management, or their
designees in response to an existing or an impending emergency. This plan may also be
activated under the following circumstances:

•
•
•
•

At the time of an actual disaster or emergency
When a community that RTD serves has declared a local state of emergency
When the Governor of Colorado has declared an emergency for areas within RTD’s
service area
When a Presidential Declaration of an Emergency or Disaster is issued for areas within
RTD’s service area

Phases of Emergency Management
RTD’s Emergency Management Program addresses all phases of emergency management for all
types of incidents, including mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.
Prevention
From the National Preparedness Goal 2nd Edition published by FEMA:

Prevention includes those capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened
or actual act of terrorism. Unlike other mission areas, which are all-hazards by design,
Prevention core capabilities are focused specifically on imminent terrorist threats,
including on-going attacks or stopping imminent follow-on attacks.
RTD Transit Police and Emergency Management Department has primary responsibility for the
prevention of terrorist or other criminal activities as it relates to the agency and its operations.
This is accomplished by close coordination with federal, state, and local law enforcement
agencies to share information about potential threats to the agency and communities within its
service area as well as conducting active video surveillance. Each individual within RTD supports
this effort by reporting indicators of terrorism, violent extremism, or other malicious actors to
RTD Transit PD.
Protection
The protection mission relates to the ability to secure and protect people, critical infrastructure,
and vital interests against human-caused and natural events. This can include activities such as
the securing of facilities, the IT network, or hardening of the supply chain.
Mitigation
The goal of mitigation is to prevent future loss by reducing or eliminating risk. Mitigation
activities like the recovery and preparedness phases of emergency management can occur
before or after an emergency. The goals of pre-emergency mitigation activities are to reduce
the chances of an emergency happening or reducing the damage suffered from unavoidable
emergencies. The goal of post-emergency mitigation is to reduce the impact of future hazards
and is a part of the recovery process.
Response
Response is the actual provision of emergency services during a crisis including the coordination
and management of resources to support emergency response operations. These activities help
to reduce casualties and damage and to speed recovery. Response activities include resource
and logistical coordination, addressing immediate life safety issues, stabilization of the incident,
and public information.
RTD responds to emergencies by activating the EOP; activating the EOC; coordinating with
public, private, and NGO partners as needed; coordinating and managing resources in support
of emergency response, and preparing for recovery activities.
Recovery
Recovery activities may be both short-term and long-term, ranging from conducting damage
assessments, removing debris, restoring essential utilities such as water and power, restoring
IT infrastructure and services, and restoring revenue service through repairing or replacing
damaged vehicles, facilities, or rail. Recovery may also incorporate mitigation measures
designed to prevent future occurrences of a given hazard. Recovery begins as soon as possible
after an incident occurs and may commence during the response phase.

Direction, Control, and Coordination
National Incident Management System (NIMS)
RTD’s emergency management organization is structured in accordance with NIMS and ICS.
NIMS integrates existing processes and methods into a unified national framework for incident
management. This framework forms the basis for interoperability and compatibility that enable
a diverse set of public and private organizations to conduct effective incident management
operations.
It does this through a core set of concepts, principles, procedures, organizational structures
(ICS, multi-agency coordination, and joint information systems), terminology, and standards
requirements applicable to a broad community of NIMS users. To ensure interoperability and
compatibility, NIMS is based on an appropriate balance of flexibility and standardization. It
provides a consistent and flexible national framework within which government and private
entities at all levels can work together to manage domestic incidents, regardless of their cause,
size, location, or complexity.
Incident Command System (ICS)
Emergency management and incident response in RTD is coordinated using the ICS. ICS
enables effective incident management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment,
personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational
structure. ICS is used to organize both near-term and long-term operations for a broad
spectrum of emergencies, from small to complex incidents, both natural and manmade. ICS is
used by all levels of government – federal, state, regional, and local – as well as by many
private-sector and NGOs.
In ICS, the IC is able to appoint individuals into leadership positions to support specific areas of
the response:
Command staff:

•
•
•

Public Information Officer
Liaison Officer
Safety Officer

General staff:

Operations Section Chief
Logistics Section Chief
Planning Section Chief
Finance and Administration Section Chief

For RTD, planning and finance and administration functions will most likely be conducted in the
EOC, however if there is a need for on-scene coordination of these functions, they will be made
available to the IC.
All activity undertaken under the EOP shall be coordinated using ICS and NIMS in accordance
with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5.

Incident Command
Single Incident Commander - Most incidents involve a single incident commander. In these
incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making
authority. The on-scene IC has tactical control of and authority over all resources at the scene.
First responders will establish Incident Command when they are on scene. RTD will always
defer authority to first responders while they are on-scene but will establish consistent
communication in a liaison function to provide information about RTD vehicles, facilities, and
response procedures. Information is to be shared freely with first responders as it becomes
available. When possible, the individual who would assume Incident Command after first
responders leave should be the liaison with First Response Incident Command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring on an RTD revenue vehicle, the operator or
conductor will begin the event as the IC. They will notify their appropriate dispatch or control

center and their street/field supervisor of the event. When the supervisor arrives on-scene, the
supervisor will take over as Incident Command. An appropriate transfer of command must
always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring at an RTD-owned facility, the highest ranking
or most qualified facilities maintenance staff present will begin the event as the IC. They will
notify their appropriate dispatch or control center and their facilities maintenance manager of
the event. When the Facilities Maintenance Manager arrives on-scene they may choose to
assume Incident Command, or to leave the current IC in charge. An appropriate transfer of
command must always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
The IC has the authority to request resources to facilitate response, including (but not limited
to):
• On-scene presence of Emergency Management Specialist
• Trained individuals to staff command staff and general staff roles (Public Information
Officer, Liaison Officer, Safety Officer, Operations Chief, Logistics Chief, Planning Chief
or Finance/Administration Chief)
• Activation of the Mobile Command Post
• Trained staff to fill any necessary operations, logistics, planning, or communication
roles
• Activation of the Emergency Operations Center
• Vehicles, parts, and other materials to maintain or restore safe conditions or safe
operation
All Street Supervisors for bus service, all Field Supervisors for rail, and all sworn Police Officers
will be expected to maintain the following trainings from FEMA or an appropriate local training
agency:
• IS 100
• IS 200
• IS 700
• IS 800
• ICS 300
These trainings will give the supervisors and sworn police officers the competency to work
within ICS and integrate with other local response agencies to preserve life safety, reduce
damage to property and reduce impact to the environment. From the time of this policy being
adopted or from promotion to a relevant supervisor position, individuals will have six months to
complete all trainings.
Unified Command
A Unified Command involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a
single IC. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note that in Unified
Command the command representatives will appoint a single Operations Section Chief.
An example when Unified Command may be used would be an intentional, malicious derailment
of a train, where Transit Police and Rail Supervisors will work together to make decisions
regarding the response.

17.G.b

Transfer of Command
Responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons. As the incident grows
a more qualified person may be required to take over as IC to handle the ever-growing needs
of the incident. Or this may occur in reverse; when an incident reduces in size, the command
can be passed down to a person with less experience, but who is still qualified to run the nowsmaller incident. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the incident
moves to a different location or area of responsibility, or the normal turnover of personnel due
to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a transfer of command
briefing, IC to IC, with the objective to give a complete picture of all events and considerations
that may impact the response and decision-making abilities of the new IC. This briefing may be
oral, written, or a combination of both. A transfer of command is posted and announced on all
radio and communication networks, especially with notification to the EOC.
Incident Coordination and/or Response Structures
Various types of operational support facilities are established in the vicinity of an incident,
depending on its size and complexity, to accomplish a variety of purposes. RTD may operate
one or more of the following incident coordination and/or response facilities during an
emergency or disaster:
•
•
•
•

ICP
EOC
Staging Area
Evacuation Transportation Hubs

Incident Command Post (ICP)
An ICP is the field location where the IC operates, onsite response is directly coordinated, and
onsite resource needs are identified and communicated. There is only one ICP for each incident
or event, but it may change locations during the event. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, the
Mobile Command Post, or within a building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the incident
scene and the potential hazard zone but close enough to the incident to maintain a visual
presence and command status. The on-scene IC has tactical control of and authority over all
resources at the scene.

Emergency Operations Center (EOC)

The RTD EOC serves as the central point for coordination of the agency’s emergency
management and response activities. The EOC does not usurp the responsibility or authority of
the IC but instead supports incident command while mobilizing resources, tracking costs,
planning for future needs, providing decision making support and Liaising with the Leadership
Team/Policy Group as needed. Like Incident Command, the EOC is scalable and flexible.
RTD has designated a primary and secondary EOC, which can be activated as necessary:

Denver, CO 80202

The EOC may also be activated in a virtual or hybrid stance using an RTD-approved platform.
Identified and trained EOC representatives will be invited to the Virtual EOC (VEOC) Channel
and will participate in the discussions as activated on an event by event basis.
The Emergency Management Specialist will serve as the EOC Manager and has the authority
and responsibility for managing the EOC and the agency’s emergency management organization
during an emergency or disaster. The EOC Manager has the authority to make all routine
decisions and is charged with advising the Leadership Team and the General Manager and CEO
when major decisions need to be made. The EOC Manager serves as a liaison with the local
jurisdictions’ emergency management agencies as well as state and federal agencies.
EOC Goals
The following are the general goals for the emergency operations center. These goals can be
adjusted by the EOC Manager in coordination with the General Manager and CEO, Chief of
Transit Police and Emergency Management, and the IC, when the EOC is activated.
• Obtain and maintain situational awareness of the incident and ensure responders
have a common operating picture
• Establish an incident planning cycle
• Manage resources (people, places, things) including tracking the status of
requests, the status and utilization of resources, and planning for the
demobilization of resources
• Procurement of emergency supplies
• Establish a seamless transition from response into recovery operations.
• Assess and document impacts from events for recovery process
EOC Activation Levels
The EOC may be activated to one of the following three levels depending on emergency needs.
Activation Level Three (Watch): The EOC activates to activation level three (AL-3) when
only public safety staff from Transit Police and Emergency Management are needed to closely
monitor a developing incident or threat. At AL-3, the EOC will begin gathering situation
awareness information, but emergency coordination is largely left to the routine processes and
procedures maintained by each department or division.
Activation Level Two (Partial): The EOC is activated to activation level two (AL-2) when
some, but not all, EOC positions are needed to manage an emergency. The EOC Manager is
responsible for determining which positions are needed to meet the agency’s needs. The
following are examples of triggers for when an AL-2 activation may be appropriate:
•
•

28

A request for EOC activation from an IC
An incident resulting in 10 or more serious injuries or fatalities

•

A credible threat of terrorism or mass violence as determined by RTD-PD, local
jurisdiction police department or the Colorado Information Analysis Center
A forecast from the National Weather Service of a blizzard warning or a prediction of
major flooding or wildfire with significant impact
A significant disruption in service requiring off-scene coordination of resources to
provide information or resources.

Activation Level One (Full): The EOC is activated to activation level one (AL-1) when all EOC
positions are needed to manage an emergency. The following are examples of triggers for when
an AL-1 activation may be appropriate:
•
•
•
•

A request for EOC activation from an IC
An incident resulting in 30 or more serious injuries or fatalities
Significant civil unrest
A forecast from the National Weather Service for historic flooding or historic winter
weather

EOC Equipment
The equipment to activate the EOC will be stored at both the primary and secondary locations
and will include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Computers
Projectors
Phones
IT infrastructure
Internet hotspots
Administrative supplies
Easels and display equipment
Printed copies of EOP and resources
Printed copies of COOP
Printed ICS forms

EOC Staffing
The EOC will be staffed utilizing a hybrid ICS/departmental model. Representatives are
expected to be knowledgeable individuals with authority to make emergency-related decisions
for their line of service. Lists of EOC representatives will be maintained by the leadership of
each discipline expected to maintain staff prepared to report to the EOC and be able to provide
this list to the Emergency Management Specialist every six months and upon request.
Each mode of transit, bus, light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit, must maintain at least
three trained EOC representatives. This allows for relief if the EOC must be activated on a 24hour basis as well as providing coverage if one of the two primary EOC representatives are
unable to report for duty for any reason.
The following lines of service must also have trained EOC representatives, with the exact
number noted below:

an on-scene ICS structure is not in place.
EOC Activation
The EOC will be activated at the request of the General Manager and CEO, Chief Operations
Officer, Chief of Police and Emergency Management, the Emergency Management Specialist, or
IC or any of the above position’s designees. Upon request, the Emergency Management
Specialist/EOC Manager will determine the appropriate level of activation and required
representatives.
Notification of EOC activation will be sent to trained representatives and Leadership Team using
ReadyOp over text and call. Only one representative will be asked to go to the EOC unless
otherwise noted.
Policy Group
The Policy Group is made up of the General Manager and CEO and their selected designees.
The General Manager and CEO may choose to consult with the Chair of the Board regarding
decisions made by the Policy Group. Should the General Manager and CEO be unable to form
the Policy Group, the COO holds the authority in their absence.
The objective of the Policy Group is to provide high level decision-making where the EOC
Manager does not have sufficient authority to make a necessary decision. Examples of Policy
Group level decisions may be:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Members of the Policy Group are not required to staff the EOC and will be requested to appoint
another representative to the EOC in the event they are present, to allow proper delegation and
accomplishment of EOC objectives.
EOC Table of Organization
Below is a sample of what role each department’s representatives may be asked to fill in an
emergency. This is not prescriptive and may be adjusted depending upon the event triggering
the activation. Leadership of each section may or may not be assigned based upon complexity
of staffing or the event.
Representatives working in the EOC will be asked to liaise between their departments and the
EOC and while staffing the EOC are acting outside of their steady-state role and hierarchy.

Information Collection, Analysis and Dissemination
Situational Awareness
There are five elements that are the backbone of good situational awareness:
•
•
•
•
•

31

Define the information requirements
Determine how to gather information
Decide who will analyze that information
Determine how that information will be shared
Choose the technology that will help communicate and manage the information

17.G.b

During the initial period of an emergency, efforts should be focused on gaining an
understanding of the situation and establishing incident priorities. A well-defined, operational
information collection capability is essential. Information collection provides situational
awareness to leadership and promotes informed decision-making. The agency has designated a
process to collect, analyze and disseminate information during an emergency to both internal
and external response partners as well as the public.
Information Collection
Information will be collected from a variety of sources. EOC Manager or their designee at the
EOC will be charged with collecting information. The following list contains examples of
potential sources of operational information:
• Revenue Vehicle Operators, Via Communications Centers
• On-scene responders (street/field supervision, facilities staff, etc)
• RTD departments
• City, county, and state situational awareness reports
• City, county, and state virtual EOC’s
• Special districts and non-governmental partners
• Television, radio, and print media
• Social media
• Survivors of the emergency and the general public
• Subject-matter experts
Information Analysis
After information has been collected, it must be analyzed to determine its credibility and
operational relevance. The EOC Manager or their designee will analyze information that is
received and prepare intelligence reports for leadership.
Dissemination
Message dissemination is categorized into internal messaging and public messaging. Internal
messaging refers to messages crafted for responders, employees, contractors, and partners,
while public messaging refers to messages crafted for public dissemination.
Internal Messaging
EOC Manager or his/her designee in the EOC will assist in conveying information as necessary
to responders, RTD departments and other partners. Additionally, EOC Manager or their
designee will maintain and update the Incident Action Plan (IAP), which will contain critical
information and intelligence updates.
Within two hours of an emergency event, the EOC Manager will brief the Policy
Group/Leadership Team with details for the event and response.
Public Messaging
Various methods of public information dissemination are available. The decision to use a
particular medium will be based on the urgency and the intended audience. Some methods of
distribution include:

Service alerts
News releases

Website updates
Social media updates

To ensure one consistent and accurate voice, all public information releases will be coordinated
through EOC Manager or their designee.

Communications
Communications are an important component of response and recovery operations. The ability
of emergency management/response personnel from different disciplines, jurisdictions,
organizations, and agencies to work together depends greatly on their ability to communicate
with each other. To effectively transmit and receive information, emergency response partners
supporting the community must have access to all available forms of communication. This
section outlines the types of equipment/systems available for internal, external and public
communication. Operational communications systems and capabilities, and effective
communications, are essential to the success of any emergency operation. The community
maintains and operates the following communications systems to ensure effective and
operation communications between municipal personnel and with other jurisdictions.
Communications between community agencies occur through the use of several types of
communications equipment including radios, cellular and landline phones, email, and satellite
phones. In addition, the State of Colorado uses WebEOC to provide situational awareness.
The radio system RTD uses is supported by the State and is utilized by first responders across
the region and state. This is an 800 MHz system and has redundant towers in the Denver
Metro Area. All radio talk groups have access to MetroNET, which is the mutual aid channel in
the Denver Metro Area. RTD’s system is segregated into bus operations, rail operations,
Transit Police, and some single channels available for support services such as treasury
maintenance. There is only one encrypted channel available and it is on the police talk group.
Bus operations is set up to facilitate on-demand communication, where all other channels are
push-to-talk. The radio system is maintained by IT’s Mobile Technologies group.
In addition, RTD’s Emergency Management Specialist sends situational awareness updates for
events that may require emergency coordination.
Alert and Notification
RTD utilizes service alerts to inform customers and the public about disruptions to the system.
This is predominantly sent via app alerts and emails for registered users on selected routes of
importance to the individual. The organization also communicates with the public via news
releases and media advisories.

Customer Care is also a point of contact for the public to make requests via phone or online
communications. These are on-demand communications available 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
Notification of Key Leaders

When an emergency requires the notification of key community officials, Emergency
Notification will be done using the Emergency Notification Procedure (RTD-EM-PRC-0001).
Further updates will be made using:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Approved virtual meeting platforms
Updates to Virtual EOC Microsoft Teams channel
Email
Telephone calls and texts
Two-way radio systems (during normal business hours)

EOC Communications

RTD’s EOC is equipped with, maintains and is capable of operating, the following
communication systems: Computers with Microsoft Teams, cameras, microphones, and
Outlook, telephones, and radio.
RTD conducts periodic communications tests to ensure that its systems are operational, and its
personnel are capable of operating the systems. More particularly, Emergency Management
Specialist conducts an emergency communication test on a semiannual basis.
Public Warning
Public warning is accomplished using the following methods as appropriate:
• Service alerts
• RTD website notifications
• Public information displays
• Public announcement systems
Public Information Officer (PIO)

The PIO has roles and responsibilities as identified in the Crisis Communications Plan which
includes:
•
•

During non-emergency times, information regarding emergency plans and actions to be taken
by the public, in the form of public information and education materials, will be provided to the
public via newsletters, brochures, and RTD’s website and social media platforms.
During an emergency, the potential for dissemination of false or misleading information is high.
This can lead to operational difficulties for responders and confusion among the public.
Misleading information can be produced from several sources. RTD will establish a media
monitoring and rumor control section in the EOC and staffed by Communications and
Engagement staff.
Finance and Administration Matters
Employee Reassignment
During an emergency, certain employees may be reassigned to complete alternate duties that
differ from their regular day-to-day responsibilities. Department administration will coordinate
with Human Resources to manage incidents and ensure staffing levels are appropriate. In
general, RTD job descriptions for non-represented employees include an ‘other duties as
assigned’ or ‘other duties as required’ clause that can be activated for emergencies. This may
require approval of the Policy Group when not previously identified in this document.
Worker’s Compensation
Worker’s compensation claims are administered by the Risk Management Division according to
Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 8-40-101, et seq. Even in an emergency employees should be
encouraged to file a workers’ compensation claim to ensure they receive appropriate medical
care and lost wage benefits related to on-the-job injuries.
Insurance and Financial Liability
RTD is self-insured for tort liability up to the limits specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity Act and has additional insurance policies in place to support the financial recovery of
the organization. For this reason, it is important to coordinate with the Risk Management
Division to ensure proper record-keeping and investigative processes are followed. These
policies include excess workers compensation, crime, fiduciary, cybersecurity, excess liability,
property and railroad liability insurance.
Timekeeping
Tracking employee time spent on emergency operations can be an important aspect of
determining disaster costs and opportunities for reimbursement by the federal government
through FTA or FEMA. RTD maintains the same timekeeping policies during regular operations
and emergency operations, but salaried employees should use Workday to log any applicable or
qualified hours worked, especially those above 40 hours/week. There may be a specific code
assigned for disaster operations hours worked.

17.G.b

Represented employees will use Kronos or TIES for their timekeeping needs, according to their
steady state timekeeping policies. If for some reason Workday, Kronos, or TIES are unavailable,
employees are to track hours manually and appropriate Finance Department staff shall make
necessary adjustments as the systems become available.
Records Retention
Records retention during emergencies is conducted using the same policies and procedures in
place during regular operation. The Records Management Procedure and Records Retention
Schedule Policy, created and maintained by the Information Management and Governance
Division can be found on the agency’s intranet, i.e., “The Hub.” Records to be retained during
and after an emergency include personnel hours, equipment costs, expenditures/procurement,
costs incurred by RTD, etc. in compliance with RTD policies and procedures and C.F.R. Title 44,
Emergency Management Assistance. Records related to Safety Management System processes
and activities, including after action reports must be retained for a minimum of three years, in
compliance with the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.
Documenting Response and Recovery Operations
RTD will use IAPs and SitReps to document response and recovery efforts. Other
documentation will be used to record cost recovery information, requests for aid, budget
control, legal advice, operational efficiency, and other relevant areas of response and recovery
activities.
After Action Reporting (AAR)
Training exercises and any real-world activations of this plan shall be followed by a written AAR.
These will be written following federal guidance, in particular the Homeland Security Exercise
and Evaluation Program. AARs should contain at a minimum:
•
•
•
•

The activities that took place
Areas for improvement
Successes
An improvement plan with individual/department/division assignments

Once AARs are complete, Emergency Management will review with Leadership Team and with
the affected lines of service. The potential continuous improvement actions will be tracked by
emergency management and will be annually reviewed for completion or removal. AARs should
be reviewed prior to any exercise to ensure that any previous issues are recognized and
corrected as successfully as possible.

Emergency Procurement and Spending
RTD uses any existing contracts first to make purchases and secure goods and services for
emergency requirements. If such a contract is not available, the EOC Manager and the
Emergency Management Specialist each has authority to spend up to $25,000 by use of an RTD
Purchase Card (P-Card) for emergency purchases if it is not possible or practicable to initiate a
purchase requisition (PR) for the emergency purchase. These purchases require emergency
justification and supporting documentation, consistent with the Procurement Standards Manual
or its successor document. Purchase authorizations above this limit must be approved by the
Policy Group.

Emergency Contracting
Emergency and post-disaster contracts will be managed by the Contracting and Procurement
Division. Allowing emergency contracting during an emergency is an important way to avoid
lengthy contract bidding processes and speed up response and recovery efforts; however, it
should be carefully managed in order to prevent RTD and the taxpayers from potentially
overpaying for goods and services by failing to facilitate appropriate competition for taxpayer

Plan Development and Maintenance
EOP Coordination
This EOP will be promulgated every three years. The reviews, revisions, updates, and changes
made to the plan will begin with the Emergency Management Division of the RTD-PD, which will
then elevate the plan as needed if signatures are required for the changes to the plan. If any
necessary plan changes originate outside the Emergency Management Division, the need for
updates will be communicated to the appropriate department via email to ensure version
control and accountability.
Planning and Coordination Responsibility
The Emergency Management Division of RTD-PD is tasked with maintaining, distributing, and
updating this EOP. Revisions to this EOP will be coordinated by the Emergency Management
Division who will also review and approve any proposed revisions.
EOP Updates
Plan maintenance includes updating and revising the plan to reflect all changes, testing the plan
periodically, and ensuring that all personnel remain up to date on their roles and responsibilities
as outlined in the plan. If any issues emerge, situations change, gaps become apparent, and/or
requirements change, the plan must be updated to reflect these and remain usable, compliant
and up to date. The EOP will be reviewed annually, after any exercises, following any changes
in requirements, and/or after actual incidents, as necessary.
EOP Reviews and Updates
This EOP is continuously monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness, and will be updated
after the following:

•
•
•
•
•

When lessons learned from real-world incidents are reviewed
When hazard risks or risk areas change
When alert and warning systems change
When applicable government planning standards are changed
When changes to applicable laws and regulations require updates

EOP Revision
Anyone who plays a role in implementing the EOP should be appropriately trained on the plan
and understand their role in supporting emergency response operations. RTD exercises its EOP
annually; however, real world events that result in activations may be substituted for an
exercise if deemed appropriate.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Fare Structure

July 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the fare structure recommendations from the Systemwide Fare Study
and Equity Analysis.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study) was initiated in 2022. The intent of the Study
has been to explore simplifying fares to make services more equitable and easier to understand while
aligning fares with the service value provided. Unlike previous fare studies, this study was driven by a
customer-centric approach, focusing on equity, affordability, and simplicity. To ensure a communitydriven process and inclusion of voices often not heard, the project team partnered with communitybased organizations (CBOs) to assist in reaching their respective client populations. Additionally, the
project team established stakeholder groups, representing larger constituencies, through three focused
feedback panels: Equity, Pass Program, and Jurisdiction. The feedback panels used customer and
community input to provide feedback to RTD on how the fare structure could best meet the Study’s
goals (equity, affordability, and simplicity), fulfill customer and community needs, and balance trade-offs
among all goals and needs. The three feedback panels convened during each of the three engagement
milestones.
Prior to the release of the final recommendation, the Study included three primary rounds of customer
and community engagement at key milestones:
1. Milestone #1 (April/May 2022) introduced the Study and provided opportunity to comment on
the existing fare structure
2. Milestone #2 (June/July 2022) introduced conceptual fare options along with evaluation
criteria for review
3. Milestone #3 (October – December 2022) introduced two preliminary fare alternatives for
review
In developing the final recommendation for public review, the project team considered the following:

Customer and community feedback
Fare strategies to achieve the three study goals of equity, affordability, and simplicity
Impact on minority and low-income populations

During the February 14, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff presented a preliminary
draft recommendation for fare structure changes. The recommendation was based on customer and
community feedback received on the preliminary alternatives presented in Milestone #3. The Board was
invited to provide questions and comments on the recommendation.
Staff presented the draft fare equity analysis and addressed specific questions and comments from the
Board during the April 12, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee. Following this meeting, the project
team initiated an extensive public outreach process to gather feedback on the recommendation. The
draft fare equity analysis on the draft recommendation was released to the public for comment in
tandem with the released final fare structure recommendation.
DISCUSSION
In adopting the recommendations of the Study, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The project team has now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare
changes and final draft Title VI fare equity analysis. Consequently, the proposed fare changes are ready
for Board review. The following discussion is divided into five sections:
1. Community outreach activities
2. Feedback on final recommendations
3. Final recommendations summary
4. Projected ridership and revenue forecasts
5. Implementation
1. Community Outreach Activities
In the fourth and final phase of public engagement for the Study, customers and community members
had the opportunity to provide feedback on the recommended changes to the fare structure, policies and
programs through public comment. The public comment period was open from April 13 to May 24,
2023. To inform customers and community members of the proposed changes and to promote the
public comment process, the project team relied on several key communications channels and
engagement methods. These methods focused on inclusive public participation best practices outlined in
the Federal Transit Administration’s Title VI Requirements and Guidelines, including:
•
•

Virtual public hearings: Four virtual public hearings were held; two presentations were conducted
in English and two in Spanish
In-person open houses: The project team hosted two in-person open houses at locations with
easy transit access. All materials and signage were available in both English and Spanish, and

Packet Pg. 810

18.H

•

•

attendees could view and hear presentations as well as ask questions in English or Spanish.
American Sign Language interpretation was provided on site; additional language interpretation
was available upon request
Community events and station pop-ups: To reach customers in the communities where they live
and work, the project team hosted nine pop-up events at bus and rail stations throughout RTD’s
service area and participated in 10 community events, festivals and farmers markets. Staff also
participated in meetings facilitated by transit and planning organizations, such as the Denver
Regional Council of Governments and Denver Mobility Access Coalition, as well as RTD
community committees, including the Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities, the
Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee and the Citizens Advisory Committee
Community partner outreach: The project team continued its collaboration with five community
partners (Athletics and Beyond, CREA Results, Denver Streets Partnership, Focus Reentry and
Una Mano Una Esperanza) who promoted Study events, educated community members about the
proposed changes, and supported community members to submit written or online comments.
The partners hosted and participated in community events, promoted on social media and via
word-of-mouth, and engaged with community members at food banks, schools, faith-based
organizations and other community spaces
Digital promotion: RTD updated its Fare Feedback website to provide an overview of the
recommended fare changes; the impact those changes would have on Local, Regional, Airport,
youth, discount and Access-a-Ride customers; adult, youth, student, organizational and employer
programs and discounts including the LiVE program expansion; the fare equity analysis and the
Study engagement to-date. The site was available in English and Spanish, with language access
instructions as well as two-page overviews of the recommendation available in more than 20
additional languages, including all of RTD’s 21 safe harbor languages
Media: RTD earned stories about the proposed fare changes and the public comment period in top
English- and Spanish-language media, including print, broadcast and radio

During this final phase of outreach, the project team members engaged with more than 2,600
community members. At the conclusion of the public comment period, 731 comments were submitted.
2. Feedback on Final Recommendations
Through the outreach process, significant support was provided for the components of the
recommendation. The following themes were present in the feedback:
Fare Structure
There was strong support for changes to the fare structure that would support the Study’s goals of
simplicity, affordability, and equity.
•

•

Simplicity: Participants expressed support for the consolidation of the Local and Regional fare
levels, indicating this would provide much needed simplicity and benefit customers who travel
longer distances
Affordability: Many commenters expressed appreciation for the reduction in costs, particularly in
an era of increasing inflation. In particular:

Packet Pg. 811

18.H

Commenters supported the decreased full fare monthly pass price ($88) and discount
monthly pass price ($27), explaining that this would benefit frequent transit users,
especially airport employees and regular travelers to the Denver International Airport with
the inclusion of the Airport fare within the monthly pass
o Many comments noted that the lower monthly pass price made transit more cost
competitive with driving and parking. Some previous customers indicated that the
decrease in fares would encourage them to begin using RTD services again; commenters
believed that may result in increased transit use/decrease car traffic and related
environmental benefits
o Nonprofit staff members stated the price decreases would support the needs of their
clients who may be transit-reliant or have limited financial resources
Equity: Commenters noted that transit-reliant equity populations would be well served by this
recommendation. They indicated that changes to the fare structure and discount programs would
allow individuals with disabilities, low-income customers, older adults, and community members
who are unhoused to attend appointments, travel to work or school, and make other necessary
trips without incurring significant cost burdens associated with transit. Others supported the
incorporation of the LiVE discount into Access-a-Ride fares
o

•

There were also some suggestions for further improvements to the fare structure, many of which were
considered through the fare study process but found to be financially or operationally unfeasible.
•
•

•

Simplicity: Many commenters urged RTD to have a single fare for all destinations, including
Denver International Airport
Affordability: Many commenters urged RTD to further reduce prices or provide zero-fare transit
for all customers. Some commenters indicated the Airport fare ($10) is still a financial burden and
is not a cost-competitive option, especially for groups of individuals traveling together. Some also
encouraged RTD to offer higher discounts for customers using discount programs and suggested
that discounts for older adults should start earlier to coincide with retirement
Equity: A number of commenters encouraged RTD to consider fares rounded to the nearest (and
lowest) dollar to ensure customers using cash would not overpay for service – or to ensure
drivers have change to offer to customers in return for overpayment. RTD was also encouraged
to provide additional outreach for discount programs to ensure eligible customers were aware of
their existence, with grocery stores, food banks and libraries listed as locations to promote
information and possibly offer retail options for Discount pass purchases

Zero Fare for Youth
Overwhelming enthusiasm was shown for the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program, noting that this would:
•
•
•
•

Support youth in accessing school and work
Benefit families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who
see driving as a more affordable option
Meet climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provide youth with independence and agency

Packet Pg. 812

18.H

•

Support lifelong transit use

Comments also encouraged RTD to seek long-term funding sources, potentially through the State of
Colorado, to ensure the program lasts beyond the first year.
Additional Passes and Programs
Commenters viewed the transit assistance grant program as a benefit for non-profit organizations with
limited budgets who aim to support clients with travel needs to appointments, food banks, job
interviews and others. They also voiced support for the updates to the EcoPass program and its positive
impact on commuting employees. RTD was also encouraged to consider other ways to decrease the cost
of transit for commuting employees, including those traveling to Denver International Airport.
3. Final Recommendations Summary
The final recommendations would lower fares for all customers and would simplify the fare structure by
combining the Local and Regional fares into a single fare category to be referred to as a Standard fare.
Additionally, the new structure would reward frequent customers with a less expensive Monthly Pass
which could be used for travel to all destinations, including Denver International Airport.

Adult Full Fares
For comparison purposes, the tables below provide a summary of the existing fare structure alongside
the recommended fare structure for customers paying the full fare.

Adult Discounted Fares
Under the recommendation, customers eligible for a discounted fare would be able to travel to any
destination, including Denver International Airport. The existing and recommended fares are shown in
the tables below.
Existing Fare Structure Discount Fare (Age 65+, Disabilities, Medicare)

Recommended Fare Structure

Access-a-Ride Fares
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
allows transit agencies to charge up to twice the
comparable fixed-route fare for paratransit fares. The
recommended fare structure would lower fares for all Access-a-Ride customers and would remain below
the maximum permitted by ADA. The recommended structure would continue to allow Access-A-Ride
customers to use bus, rail and FlexRide services for zero fare. Additionally, the recommended structure
would introduce LiVE fare discounts for Access-A-Ride customers.
The tables below show the proposed fare structure compared with the existing structure for Access-aRide customers.

Recommended Access-a-Ride Fare Structure (Full Fare)

Packet Pg. 814

18.H

Recommended Access-a-Ride Fare Structure (LiVE Discount)

LiVE Program
Based on input from CBOs, the recommendation would increase the income threshold for LiVE eligibility,
while the LiVE discount would be increased from 40% to 50%, which would align with RTD’s Discount
Fare. Additionally, CBOs also expressed a need for RTD to work with community partners to better
market and expand the LiVE program. Specific recommendations for the LiVE program include the
following:
• Increase LiVE discount from 40% to 50% to align with Discount fares
• Increase income threshold from 185% to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level
• Develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan
• Eliminate the requirement for an in-District address
• Explore expanding means testing beyond current system
The tables below show the current LiVE fares and the recommended fares.

Additionally, the table below illustrates the current LiVE income threshold and the recommended
threshold.

Note: Federal poverty guidelines are defined for household sizes of 1-14 people. This table provides the
2023 guidelines for 1- to 6-person households.
Zero Fare for Youth
Throughout the community engagement process, the community expressed a strong desire for
establishing a Zero Fare for Youth program. This desire spanned across all customer and stakeholder
segments. Accordingly, the recommended fare structure would introduce zero-fare transit for youth ages
19 and younger. The age-based threshold was chosen for simplicity to ensure all high school students as
well as those who are not enrolled in school or have recently graduated are covered by the program.
Given funding limitations, this program is proposed to be introduced as a one-year pilot with the intent of
seeking funding partners to continue it as a permanent program. As discussed with the Board during the
May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, the one-year pilot program would begin
September 1, 2023, to coincide with the beginning of the academic year. Typically, FTA guidelines
allow fare pilot programs to run only for six months; on June 22, 2023, FTA officials approved RTD’s
request to offer the Zero Fare for Youth pilot for one calendar year, concluding August 31, 2024.

Recommended Changes to Existing Fare Programs
The proposed recommended draft alternative would also make changes to existing fare programs as
described herein.
Current Pass Programs
In response to customer requests for greater flexibility and predictability with the existing pass
programs, the recommendation would provide the following changes to the pass programs (EcoPass,
CollegePass, NECO Pass)
• Contracts would have fixed pricing for two-year periods, based on system utilization
• All trips priced will be based on full fare, Local, 3-Hour Pass price (higher Airport fare will not
apply to Pass Program participants)
• Contract minimums will be reduced to lower barriers to participation
• Pricing would be simplified
• New pricing would take effect in 2024
Bulk Purchases
While RTD currently has a program for bulk purchases, the recommendation would introduce an
expanded program based on input from CBOs, non-profits and businesses. The program would apply to
“retail” products (3-Hour Pass, Day Pass, 10-Rides, Monthly Pass). The program would not apply to
EcoPass participation or to resellers/sales outlets/vendors, such as King Soopers and Safeway. The
program would introduce a 10% discount for bulk fare purchases at or above $1,500.
Additional Administrative Details
Staff will develop program details within the recommended fare structure, in response to community and
customer input, that require additional administrative work and coordination with stakeholders.
4. Projected Ridership and Revenue Forecasts
Unlike previous fare study efforts, the Study did not assume specific revenue targets; however, the
2023-2028 Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP) assumes a fare revenue decrease based on the early
direction of the Study.
In addition to forecasting the revenue changes associated with a new fare structure, the effects on
ridership were also modeled. The table below illustrates 2024 forecast ridership and revenue for the
existing fare structure and the recommended alternative.

*Ranges in expected ridership and fare revenue reflect potential impacts of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot
As shown in the table, the recommendation would increase ridership over the existing fare structure by
approximately 11% to 13%. However, the ridership increase would be accompanied by a revenue
decrease of approximately 17% to 21% (over the existing fare structure). The corresponding increase in
ridership would not be enough to offset the financial impact of the lower fares. National examples
indicate that, in general, a fare decrease will result in a loss of fare revenue, despite an increase in
ridership.
Transit customers typically have what is known as an “inelastic” response to price – that is to say, they
have limited sensitivity to price. The reduction in fare revenue, while significant, would not have a
consequential impact on RTD’s budget since only approximately 6% of RTD’s overall budget is derived
from fares. No impact to service levels in the 2024-2028 MTFP timeframe would be anticipated. This is
attributed to the fact that the MTFP assumed a fare revenue reduction starting in 2024.
5. Implementation
Most of the elements of the new fare structure would be implemented in the first quarter of 2024 with
some exceptions as follows:
• Zero Fare for Youth: As reported to the Board during the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning
Committee meeting, the Zero Fare for Youth program would begin September 1, 2023, following
the completion of the two-month Zero Fare for Better Air period taking place in July and August
2023. The Zero Fare for Youth pilot would be a one-year program. For the pilot to be most
effective, staff recommends aligning the commencement of the program to coincide with the
start of the 2023-2024 school year.
• LiVE eligibility expansion: RTD currently relies on the State of Colorado PEAK system to
determine eligibility for the LiVE program. Colorado PEAK is an online service where residents can
apply for medical, food assistance, and other benefits. A substantial lead-up time is required to
change the eligibility requirements within the system. Staff has begun discussions with
appropriate state staff to ensure that the changes can be set into the system as soon as possible
after Board approval; however, the date of implementation for those changes may not correspond
with the implementation of other elements of the fare structure
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 818

18.H

As noted in the Discussion section of this report, the recommendation would decrease fare revenue by
approximately 17% to 21% compared with the existing fare structure. The reduction in fare revenue,
while significant, would not have a consequential impact on RTD’s budget since only approximately 6%
of RTD’s overall budget is derived from fares. No impact to service levels in the 2024-2028 MTFP
timeframe would be anticipated. This is attributed to the fact that the MTFP assumed a fare revenue
reduction starting in 2024. The financial impact will be included in the MTFP and budget appropriation
recommended actions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Service Change

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the September 2023 Service Changes as revised and summarized
in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the September
2023 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to select
new work assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan
for RTD’s transit network.
Current weekday ridership averages just over 175,000 boardings on the transit network. With the
coming fall/winter school year ridership demand is anticipated to increase. Efforts to increase staffing
levels have continued resulting in positive increases in both recruitment and retention. However, rail and
bus operations staffing levels remain lower than budgeted headcount, which limits the capacity to
increase service, as proposed in the Board-adopted Systems Optimization Plan (SOP).
DISCUSSION
The changes herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments aimed at further
implementation of the SOP and adapting service to ridership demands. Notable plans herein include
adopted SOP proposals: restructuring the Route 16/17 – West Colfax/ Golden service, reintroduction of
select trips on the Route GS – Boulder/Golden service and service level improvements consistent with
the SOP on Routes 65, 73 and 105. Along with routine schedule adjustments to improve service
reliability, the service plan will reinstate school related services that were paused for the summer of
2023.
Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence
and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time

Packet Pg. 843

18.I

performance, maintaining compliance with the agency’s Collective Bargaining Agreement with the
Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, and adjusting service levels to match autumn/winter ridership
demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the list of service proposals is provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
Supplemental information related to the proposed changes is included in Attachments B, C, D, E and F.
Summary of Public Hearings
Three public hearings were conducted:
Monday, May 15, 2023, at noon (virtual),
Monday, May 15, 2023, at 5:30 p.m. (1660 Blake Street, Rooms T & D)
Tuesday, May 16, 2023, 5:30 p.m. (virtual).
These meetings have been recorded and are available for review. Written communications and public
comments collected during this public comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachment
G of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose revision to these initial
modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 16 – West Colfax/17 – Golden: split Route 16 into two distinct service patterns, Routes 16 and
17, previously proposed as Route 16G.
D Line – Mineral/Littleton Station to 18th • California Station: minor schedule adjustments due to coping
panel project.
R Line – Peoria Station to Ridgegate Station: minor schedule adjustments due to coping panel project.

Route 16 – West Colfax/17 – Golden
Current on-time performance: 11.4% late, 84.7% on time
Current ridership: 28 boardings per hour weekdays, 26.5 boardings per hour Saturdays,
23.6 boardings per hour Sundays
Per the Systems Operations Plan (SOP), splitting Route 16 into two distinct service
patterns, identified as Routes 16 and 16G
The new Route 16 pattern operates between 16th/Lincoln and Oak Station. The 16G
pattern will provide service between Oak Station, Federal Center Station and
10th/Washington in Golden.
The results of the introduction of the new patterns will reduce service midday between
Oak Station and Downtown Golden on weekends. Conversely, this proposal improves ontime performance on the West Colfax alignment, by reducing distance between
terminals/recovery areas. The change also aims to improve network connectivity with
increased transfer opportunities at Oak and Federal Center Stations. (See attachment B)

Public Meeting Comments
Tuesday, May 15, 2023
RTD - Blake Street
Rooms T&D
5:30 p.m.

Anakin Skywalker Wondering if the Route 44 is proposed to run from Wheat Ridge●Ward
Road Station to Civic Center Station? Would it be possible to extend the Route 44 to I25●Broadway Station?
Michael Thein Ramps for the B line at Westminster Station are too steep. No person in a
manual wheelchair can make it up that grade. The shelterboard times at 72nd●Federal stop
need updating.
Kirk Miller Decatur●Federal Station ADA ramps are poorly placed and are so spread out that
people miss their bus connections. The lighting for the tunnel is poor creating a safety
concern, leaving those with mobility extremely vulnerable. RTD should reevaluate the
ramps. The long steep ramps are not preferred, if that is RTD’s preference then a bar should
be provided for those with manual wheelchairs to pull themselves up the ramp. Would prefer
switchback ramps, it is easier for those with manual wheelchairs to maneuver and gives
them a break. E-Scooters are blocking access to stops and stations, RTD should partner with
them to have better parking locations. 120th Avenue access is difficult and unsafe for
passengers to maneuver.
Natalie Bororca Daughter lives in Erie, she lives in Denver, it takes 90 minutes to get to her
daughters via the JUMP. Would it be possible to extend the JUMP to Wagon Road PnR,
even just hourly, would shorten her commute to Erie. Is it possible to extend FlexRide to
Erie?
Micki Conte The website changes are not ideal, few things are missing including the 3L. It
showed the Route 10 running out to Aurora, but now she can’t find it again.
Extra trash cans have disappeared from the Colorado and Alameda eastbound far side stop,
they need to be emptied. FlexRide used to her doctor’s off Havana, but now she doesn’t
have a way to get to the doctors because the buses don’t operate when she can go to the
doctor. There is no way for her to catch the Route 40 for the 3:48 a.m. trip on the A Line
to DEN.

Attachment: Attachment G (4800 : September 2023 Service Change)

Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Maux Sullivan, Manas Subbaraman, Matt Biskey,
and Tegan Rice. There were 12 members from the public in attendance.

Rachel Hicks lives in Littleton and takes the Route 66 to the Route AT to work at the airport.
Two-years ago staff shifted the trips to meet, and she loves RTD for that change. Now the
proposal to remove the last two trips in the evening prevents her from being able to get
home from the airport. The airport has mandated that the restaurants remain open longer

September 2023 Virtual Public Meeting Transcript

Brandon Figliolino:
Excellent.
I think we are ready to go.
Yes, so good evening.
My name is Brandon Figliolino.
I am the Manager of Community Engagement here at the Regional Transportation district
and I am joined by my colleague Maux Sullivan, Lead Service Planner and Scheduler for the
East team, and we are here to talk to you tonight about service changes that are proposed
for the September 2023 run board.
Brandon Figliolino:
We have a lot happening at RTD right now.
First and foremost, we are in the final stages of our fare study and equity analysis.
We have a proposed fare structure that is out for review from the public.
If you want to learn more about the proposed changes to our fair structure, you can visit
our website at www.rtd-denver.com/fare.
Study.
We have a survey that is open now through May 24th.
Please look at the website and offer your feedback.
Uh, the board of directors will review the final draft in July and if adopted, the changes
would go into effect in the first quarter of 2024.
We also have another campaign going on called respect the ride respect the ride is our code
of conduct.
Brandon Figliolino:
We've rephrased it to be respect the ride guide, just reminding people to be safe and
courteous on trains and buses and at stations.
We have proposed changes to that respect the right guide that are also on our website and
we encourage you to review those changes and provide feedback.
Our goal is to make them easier to understand the norms that we have for one another as
we operate and ride trains and buses.
So please offer your comments now through June 2nd and now I will pass it off to my
colleague mode to talk about the proposed service changes.

Maux Sullivan:
Thanks, Brandon, and good evening.
Thank you for joining us on so.
In terms of a minor service adjustments, as we always do in the fall, we're going to bring
back our school tripper service.

Packet Pg. 860

18.I.g

Maux Sullivan:
So again, those routes impacted would be the DASH, JUMP, SKIP, NB1 and NB2 and the
225 and then these are the next are service minor service adjustments.
So, these are routes where maybe they're on-time.
Performance wasn't meeting our standards or there's an issue with the respite time at the
terminals for the operators.
So, these routes you'll see maybe just minor adjustments on the schedule for if these are
any of your routes that would be the route 8, 19, 21, 24, 51, 66, 76, FF! and the P and
again and you know where when you pick up the bus, it might be a little bit earlier or later
than you're used to.
So just minor schedule adjustments and then similarly minor schedule adjustments for rail
that will impact the E&W lines.
And then we have a couple changes that we're also doing in conjunction with the system
optimization plan.
If you're unfamiliar, this was adopted by the Board of Directors in July of 2022.
It's a 5-year plan for us to kind of institute service by kind of rebalancing our service to meet
our demands and based on the resources we have available.
So again, we have a few changes that are consistent with what was outlined in that board
approved plan and the first is we're kind of splitting the Route 16.
So, it'll be the route 16 and 17 if you're familiar with the system optimization plan, you may
know this as the 16 and 16G.
We've decided to use the route name 17 instead, but anyway it's so the first part of this is
splitting the Route 16 so that it'll still serve between downtown Denver.
So, 16th Ave and Lincoln St and then Oak station.
Maux Sullivan:
And so that'll be there will be 15-minute frequency on that portion of the route for the 16
and then in terms of the 17, so next slide.
The 17 will connect to the 16 at Oak Station.
It will also serve the Federal Center station as well as Golden at 10th St and Washington
Ave, so there is a map on the screen, but this information can also be found on our website,
rtd-denver.com/servicechanges and this the 17 will also operate on a 15-minute frequency
during the weekdays and peaks. and then the Route 65
Will it be expanding the service span on that route so weekdays 5:00 AM to midnight and
then on the weekend it'll operate between 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM and then for the Route

Attachment: Attachment G (4800 : September 2023 Service Change)

These are just a couple trips on some select routes to handle the increased demand from
the students either traveling to or from school on those routes.
So that's route 11, 20, 24, 30, 51, 65 and 73.
And then similarly next slide up in Boulder or up in the North region, we add frequency.
When CU students return to campus and for BVSD and then also add service on the NB1
and NB2 so that it goes to Eldora for when Ski season starts.

73 just a minor rerouting to make it a little bit more of a direct service into the Bellevue
station.
There are, if you're familiar with the system optimization plan.
There is also a recommendation to increase frequency.
However, due to our limited resources at that time will be changing the frequency at a later
date.
We're not able to make that change right now, but we are changing the routing for
September. We're proposing changing the routing.
So, and then the 105 as the system optimization plan states will be all trips will terminate
in the South of that route at Southmoor Station.
So that's that'll be a discontinuation of the routing into DTC, which is always had really low
ridership.
And we're also increasing the service on Sunday, so it'll be 15-minute midday service on
Sundays and then the Route 120E and 120W will now connect into Wagon Rd.
Park and ride, so to provide a little bit more of a direct connection there at the park and ride
to other services.
The Route 121, which services Peoria St, will have 15-minute frequencies added on
Saturdays South of Peoria Station.
Excuse me?
And so, every other trip will continue the 40th Ave and Airport Blvd.
And then we are bringing back the GS.
So, we're excited about that.
We know there's been a lot of requests about that.
Umm, so there will be 4 northbound trips, 2 in the morning and two in the afternoon, and
then four southbound trips.
So, 2 in the morning and two in the afternoon.
And that is all the proposed changes for September and the last day to submit comments.
So, you can either provide comments here or email us or call us.
The last day is Friday, May 19th, and if you'd like to submit via email, you can email us at
service.changes@rtd-denver.com or you can call us at 3032992004 or I'll turn it over to
Brandon and as he can kind of facilitate any questions or comments you may have now, and
these changes are proposed are slated to go into effect September 3rd.

Brandon Figliolino:
Scott, you have a question?

Maux Sullivan:
You know, defer to Tegan our rail lead for that question.
Tegan Rice:
Umm, so we are shutting down the L line for the usual events that are coming up right now,
including the Colfax Marathon, which I believe is Saturday, and we have Jazz Fest and
Juneteenth coming up with all of these downtown events.
Tegan Rice:
Who already have permits to shut down the streets, it's been difficult for us to get permits
with the city of Denver to do the needed switch repairs.
M Scott Ramming PhD PE:
Ohh.

Tegan Rice:
Uh, so I do not have a date yet as to when that rail replacement and switch repair is going
to occur.
M Scott Ramming PhD PE:
OK.
Thank you.
Tegan Rice:
Sure.

Attachment: Attachment G (4800 : September 2023 Service Change)

M Scott Ramming PhD PE:
I'm curious.
It's not necessarily a service change, but I had recalled seeing some information that the
line would be closed for a few weeks, 4 worked on the rails, or I guess the maybe the switch
you're Downing station and but more recently I only see about the E, H, R line closure.
I don't know if you're trying to finish that up before taking on another quarter to.
So, I'm just curious if anyone has any information about when that might be.

Brandon Figliolino:
Are there any other questions or public comments this evening?
Oops, I did not mean to raise my own hand.
Well, seeing no other questions, you can, uh, drop us a line anytime.
As most said, you can email service.changes@rtd-denver.com if a question or comment
comes up.
You can also give us a ring and leave a voicemail at the 299 2004 number.
