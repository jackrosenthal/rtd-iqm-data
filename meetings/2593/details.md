## II. April Board Meeting Agenda Review

Motion:               Director Walker made the motion to approve moving the April 18th, 2017 Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Hoy briefly reviewed the Board agenda.

General Manager Genova proposed that the executive session originally scheduled for the Operations & Customer Service Committee (OCS) Meeting of April 11, 2017, but subsequently canceled be added to the Board Meeting agenda for April 18, 2017.

Director Menten agreed.

Chair Hoy clarified that the motion at hand would be to approve the draft Board agenda with the addition of the executive session.

Director Menten asked how the language for the executive session would read.

General Manager Genova and Barbara McManus said that the language would be the same as that which appeared in the OCS agenda. General Manager Genova said the Board would likely not be as pressed for time at a Board Meeting.

Chair Hoy asked if there were any objections.

Director Anderson asked for assurances that the executive session was intended to discuss legal issues. She noted that, pursuant to Colorado law, only certain topics are permissible for executive sessions. She said she wanted to make sure that the particular matter to be discussed is a subject that could be discussed in executive session under Colorado law.

General Manager Genova said that the matter at hand is similar to other things the Board has discussed. He said that he would be discussing contract requirements related to the Eagle P3 Project.

Chair Hoy said that Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, would be one of the main presenters and that Mr. Asphaug knows the requirements of the open meetings law.

Director Menten asked whether discussing the matter during an open meeting would damage negotiations.

General Manager Genova said that would be a possibility.

Vote on

Motion:               The motion passed with 4 in favor (Hoy, Deadwyler, Walker, Menten), 0 opposed, and 1 absent (Francone).

## III. Other Matters

Director Menten stated it is her understanding that, if something were improperly discussed during an executive session, a relevant Colorado court ruling from Greenwood Village held that the First Amendment rights of an individual overrules the executive session privilege. She said that the person would not be barred from speaking to the matter outside of the meeting.

Director Anderson said she was familiar with the lawsuit.
