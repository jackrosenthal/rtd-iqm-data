BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: January 28, 2019

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

January 28, 2019

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 2nd year (2019) option
2017-2019 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 37DM002

General

Board Meeting Date: February 26, 2019

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the second and final option year (2019) of a three-year contract for the
annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for
$405,250.73. Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2019 Adopted expense budget
for Capital Programs.
This action addresses Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services of the General Manager’s
goals for 2019.

BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised process, and the
contract was awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in
April of 2017. The first option year to this contract was approved by an RTD Board Action on February
27, 2018. Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very
good contractor. The current base contract value and proposed amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
$ 200,000.00
$ 1,061,282.25
Second option year (2019) $ 405,250.73
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and both option years (2018 & 2019) =
$1,466,532.98
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

This second amendment (2nd year option) will increase the contract by $ 405,250.73, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $ 1,466,532.98.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $405,250.73 funding for this Board Action is included in the 2019 Adopted expense budget for
Capital Programs.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute all documents necessary to award a Contract Amendment to initiate the
second and final option year (2019) of a three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements
& Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $405,250.73. Funding for this
contract amendment is included in the 2019 Adopted expense budget for Capital Programs.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second and
final option year (2019) year of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements
& Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for
Bid (IFB) for this year’s construction work. This is not recommended because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned 2019 street improvements
c. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
d. The 2019 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
e. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Resolution Review
Attachment: BOARD TOD Update 020519 v2 (3727 : TOD)

The Board approved two resolutions regarding real property in Dec. 2015:
• Resolution 15: Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real
Property
• Requires a competitive process for disposition (unless the property is
uneconomic and the neighbor is interested)
• Requires board approval to lease or sell, EXCEPT for
• Easements, ROW dedications, licenses, and short-term leases
• Property interests valued lower than GM’s authority ($1,000,000 per a 2007 resolution)

• Resolution 16: The Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property

• Divided into “Excess Property” and “Joint Development”
• No mention of lease vs. sale explicitly, though TOD Evaluation Guidelines (adopted
Winter 2018) explicitly state preference for lease over sale in cases of joint
development

Lease vs. Sale for TOD
A preference for leasing is clearly stated in the TOD
Evaluation Guidelines (approved 2018).
Evaluation of lease vs. sale considers the following factors:
• Potential for future transit use
• Financial benefit to RTD
• Market viability

Examples:

• 5 acre property at a rail station
• 5,000 SF property 500 yards from rail line

Introduction
Attachment: 2018 TOD Status Report md (3727 : TOD)

This report provides an update on transit-oriented development
(TOD) in the Regional Transportation District (RTD). Highlights
of this report include:
• A significant amount of development in the region has
occurred within the station influence area (half-mile radius
from RTD’s stations)
• Development within the station influence area continues at a
strong rate
• 2018 accounted for the most office TOD deliveries ever

The Denizen – Alameda Station

• The buildout of the area around Denver Union Station is
nearly complete

Per RTD’s TOD Strategic Plan (2010):
• More compact and dense development
within a 10-minute walk or ½-mile
distance around transit facilities compared
to existing development patterns in the
same area
• A mix of uses — either horizontal or
vertical — usually including residential,
retail, and office employment
• High-quality, pedestrian-oriented urban
design and streetscapes

Windsor at Broadway Station – I-25•Broadway Station

Depot Square – Boulder Junction

What enables TOD?
• Real estate market - creates greater demand for development
• Zoning - higher densities allow more people to live & work near transit
• Infrastructure/Access - critical for all developments
• Jurisdiction Interest/Incentives - local governments can
incentivize TOD by providing financial incentives, density bonuses, or
infrastructure
• Lot size and ownership - larger lots & fewer land owners facilitate
TOD
• Time - station areas may need time to mature

RTD TOD Data and Analysis
This report analyzes two datasets: the RTD Development Database and the TOD Trend Tool.

The RTD TOD Database and TOD Trend Tool provide
the data needed to understand how and where
development occurs in relation to transit. This data is
analyzed in different ways, providing many helpful
outputs, including:
• TOD vs non-transit development
• Development trends over time and by
corridor/station
• Development by corridor/station
5

TOD Trend Tool
Tool that analyzes property data from a national
database (CoStar); has a broader definition of
TOD:
• Distance - development must be within a
half-mile radius of station
• Type of Development - includes all
properties, regardless of characteristics
• Scale - all multifamily/office developments
are included, regardless of scale

Solana – Olde Town Arvada Station

Attachment: 2018 TOD Status Report md (3727 : TOD)

RTD Development Database
Database actively managed by RTD staff that tracks
developments near RTD stations; has a narrower
definition of TOD:
• Distance - development must be within a half-mile
walk of station
• Type of Development - development must adhere
to TOD principles
• Scale - only larger scale developments are included
