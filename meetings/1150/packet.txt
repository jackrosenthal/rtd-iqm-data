RESOLUTION No. ____
SERIES OF 2013
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF UNIFORM SALES TAX
Whereas, RTD is authorized pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-119 (2) to collect a sales and use tax on transactions or other
incidents with respect to which a sales or use tax is levied by the state pursuant to the provisions of article 26 of title 39;
and
Whereas, from time to time exceptions to transactions on which the state and RTD may each levy a sales or use
tax have been authorized by the legislature; and
Whereas, to avoid confusion, facilitate administration and collection, and streamline payment it is the best interest
of RTD, the state and the taxpayers of the district to ensure uniformity in the transactions and incidents on which a sales
or use tax is levied; and
Whereas the RTD has designated potential increased revenues realized from uniform collection of sales or use tax
as a source from which to fund remaining FasTracks Projects primarily;
o
o
o

Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit to Table Mesa for a total RTD commitment of $135 million
Construction of North Metro at least to 72nd - Board authority to issue a Request for Proposals for
construction to at least 72nd has already been granted
Additional Fast Tracks partially-funded projects

Whereas, RTD has identified funds that RTD believes will be sufficient to enable the release of a Request for
Proposals (RFP) of the North Metro Rail Line to 72nd and may include options to extend beyond 72nd, which RFP will be
released in the third quarter of 2013; and
Whereas, RTD has authorized funding and entered into agreements with the Colorado Department of
Transportation and the High Performance Toll Enterprise for $135 million for US 36 BRT; to be completed in accord
with Record of Decision issued in 2009 and supplemented in September 2012; and
Whereas, receipt of additional revenue will accelerate RTD’s funding of these designated projects;
Whereas, in addition to the commitment of FasTracks funds identified above RTD has obligated $2.5 million of
base system funds to evaluate North Area Mobility Improvements to serve the northern and north-western parts of the
district.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
RTD supports legislation that will ensure uniformity of sales and use tax collection and the receipt of any
increased revenues which can be used to accelerate funding of the remaining FasTracks projects designated by the Board.
