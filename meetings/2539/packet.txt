paver removal or rehab and the result was an
even split

Potential Process:
OED conducts a competitive RFQ process to select a developer for a project
for work-force, for sale housing for households in the 80-100% AMI range.
OED negotiates subsidy needed with selected developer. Subsidy is targeted at
covering additional insurance and construction costs for condominiums +
difference in value generated by a mixed-income vs. market-rate development.
RTD sells land to Denver at fair market value upon completion of successful
developer solicitation and negotiations. Staff recommends granting an option
to sell the property to Denver prior to OED issuing the RFQ.
•

Sale will be contingent on meeting specific goals and requirements.

•

Creates certainty for selected development partner.

•

Allows flexibility in structuring the transaction to attract a high-quality
experienced developer who can help create a model for mixed-income
condominium development in the region.

Next Steps:
Identify Board questions and concerns.
Return with an action incorporating Board feedback.

legal counsel is for Board Directors to refrain from accepting anything of value from
other than personal friends and family from the time of certification of the election until
such time as an opinion is rendered or refused. If you are invited to a dinner or meal
where the expected value exceeds $50.00, please offer to pay for your own meal.

2.0.

Reimbursable Expenses

To protect the interest of the District and to provide guidelines for the Directors to
follow, the following provisions govern allowances for out of town and local
business related expenses within established budget limits.
Only business
expenses may be claimed. The purchase of alcohol is not reimbursable and should
not be reflected on submitted receipts.
Ordinary and necessary RTD business related expenses may be reimbursed with
proper receipts provided the itemized receipt shows time, date, business purpose,
and includes the name(s) and title(s) of any qualifying attendee. An ordinary
expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field of trade, business or
profession. Board members are asked to exercise sound judgment in the incurring
and submittal of such expenses, keeping within the standards and proprieties of an
agency supported by public tax money. Examples of ordinary and necessary local
expenses include mileage reimbursement, conference or seminar registration fees,
parking, business meeting expenses, and attendance at transit related or
community events that are considered a necessary part of conducting District
business. Political meetings, partisan conferences or political group activities will
not be covered as an RTD Expense.
Meals and entertainment expenses need to be supported by a list of attendees and
the business purpose of the events along with an itemized receipt. If meetings
between Directors, employees and/or business contacts take place outside of the
District office, the meal costs will be equally divided among the Board members
attending and charged to their local expense account. In order to be reimbursed,
Directors must provide itemized receipts, names and positions of the individuals
involved and a brief statement of the business purpose. RTD will not reimburse
meals for spouses unless the local event is an approved transit related event.
Expenses for meals submitted without a proper itemized receipt and documentation
of time, place and purpose will only be reimbursed $10.00 at the discretion of the
Chair.
Expenses for meals, flights, hotels, etc., cannot be reimbursed for either local or
out-of-town travel for any non RTD transit related business (This includes any and
all expenses for spouses or dependents). If you go early, or leave late from, a
regularly scheduled RTD event or conference, your hotel and meals on those days
are not reimbursable. If you airfare is higher than the airfare for the conference

All Travel arrangements for the RTD Board members will be handled
by the Board Office. Travel authorizations signed by the Chair are
required for all travel. Directors should contact the office at least
thirty (30) days in advance and provide all information needed to
complete the airline and hotel accommodations. If a Director chooses
to make their own travel arrangements, all travel confirmations are to
be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking for the
purpose of providing travel packets. Such information will include:
 Purpose of the trip
 Destination
 Requested arrival and departure time
 Preferred airline and Frequent Flyer Number (if applicable)
 Any applicable discounts, credits or travel miles to be utilized
 Special Considerations
 Travel Advance Required
Unless prior approval is obtained, Board members will travel on the
most economical fare for the required travel. The Board Office will
make every effort to get the Directors their desired flights and host
hotel accommodations. The Board Office will provide travel packets
to the Board member with the flight, hotel/payment confirmation,
transportation information, copy of agenda/registration, and other
pertinent travel information including an envelope for receipts,
expense form and travel advance.
Travel requests received less than seven business days before the
scheduled trip will be processed based on the most current rates and
availability. A travel approval must be submitted prior to booking any
travel and a travel advance will not be issued due to such short
notice.
3.2.

Travel Advance
Directors may request a travel advance up to the amount of the
$200.00 for estimated out-of-pocket expense that will be incurred,
less any expenses paid directly by RTD. Advances should be limited
to expenses such as registration fees and lodging (if not pre-paid by
RTD), ground transportation, meals and gratuities.
Advances for anticipated travel expenses should be requested at least
three weeks prior to the expected departure. Cash advances will not
be granted unless sufficient funds are available in the appropriate
Director’s budget account and will be issued through General
Accounting approximately five days prior to departure. The Director
is responsible for submitting the final expense form within 30 days
after return to the District. Any unused cash advance monies are to

be submitted back to RTD in the form of a check at the time of
submitting the final expense form.
4.0.

Travel Arrangements
4.1.

Transportation
4.1.1. Air Transportation
Fees for airfare will be pre-paid by the RTD Board office upon
booking the flight. Travel by indirect routes, or inclusion of
side-trips for personal reasons, must be approved by the Board
Chair. Reimbursement for travel expenses in a host city is
allowed one day before the start of a conference or one day
following a conference where travel scheduling provisions or
same day flight times are not available or convenient. An
example, a Director would need to leave Denver on Saturday
to arrive in time for a conference with a start day of Sunday in
Washington D.C., and no flights are available to get them
there in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs
resulting from personal side trips (including hotel, food, ground
transportation and parking). Airfare is calculated on a prorated basis, but under no circumstance is RTD’s expense to
exceed the (economy class) direct route pricing.
If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that
has been arranged directly by the Board Member, a copy of
the itinerary and ticket claiming reimbursement must be
provided to the Board Office at the time of booking and with
the expense report form.
The Director pays all first-class, business class, stretch
seating, and pro-rata boarding expenses.
Directors who wish to use their frequent flyer miles (if
applicable) must provide the Board Office with the frequent
flyer number at the time of the booking. The Board Office will
request to have this information included but it is the sole
responsibility of the Director to ensure his account has been
credited with the frequent flyer mileage information.
All air transportation credits paid for by RTD are to be utilized
in the booking of future Director travel only, and is not for
personal use.
4.1.2. Ground Transportation
Directors will be reimbursed the actual expense of ground
transportation necessary to conduct official business. As a

representative for the transit agency, Board members are
expected to utilize the most efficient and timely ground
transportation when traveling locally or out of town, public
transit, shuttlebus service, UBER or LYFT, taxi and rental car
in this order of preference. If a Board member pays for the
transportation of other Board members or staff, all names are
to be documented on the receipt and expense report for
reimbursement.
4.1.3. Car Rental
Car rental expenses will be allowed with prior approval of the
RTD Board Chair, only when absolutely necessary and other
transportation is not feasible, and should be arranged by the
Board office staff. Travel between the airport and the hotel or
conference center by rental car or other means are eligible for
reimbursement with receipts.
Rental car should be contracted for a size appropriate for the
number of passengers. A copy of the rental contract must be
included with the expense report. Reasonable parking and
storage fees for rental cars may be claimed for reimbursement.
Note: Travelers are to ensure that adequate insurance
coverage is in place by purchasing optional insurance coverage
as part of the rental agreement. Cars are to be refueled before
returning to the rental agency.
4.1.4. Personal Vehicles and Travel Outside the District Other Than
by Air
The use of personal vehicles outside of the District is not
encouraged. Directors must have the Chair’s approval prior to
using a personal vehicle for official business outside the
boundaries of the District. This includes local conferences
covered in section 4.6 In State Travel.
If the Director chooses to travel by car or long distance rail vs.
air, the Board office staff will continue to follow the
established guidelines to determine the lowest available flight
cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle
is requested, the Director will be allowed mileage
reimbursement up to the maximum allowable under the
Internal Revenue Service guidelines, but not to exceed the
cost of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel
is to be determined by the Board office staff prior to the date
of travel to determine the amount that may be reimbursed for
mileage. The determination is established by example of other

Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest
fares. All supporting documentation will be submitted by the
Board office staff along with your expense form.
4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The RTD Board Office will communicate the per mile
allowance equivalent to the maximum allowable by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Board Office verifies with the RTD
Accounts Payable Supervisor the most current rates at the
start of each calendar year.
All local mileage will be paid through the local expense cost
code to the Director on all submitted travel expense forms.
Travel round trip to the airport locally will be included in this
expense if agency issued transit passes are unable to be used.
4.2.

Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)
The fee for lodging or hotel accommodations at any approved event
will be pre-paid by the Board Office using a P-Card. In the event
these fees are not pre-paid, a copy of the official hotel bill must be
provided with the expense report when claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office will make reasonable arrangements for hotel
accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that
location incurred at the single occupancy rate.
For APTA
conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee
is registered for the conference, so if you do not inform the Board
staff that you are attending a conference in a timely manner, the
conference hotel may fill up and you will have to stay elsewhere.
Hotels require a personal credit card for the person staying at the
hotel for incidentals. The RTD P-Card only covers room and tax,
upon check in, the Board member will need to provide the front desk
with their own personal credit card for miscellaneous expenses.
When checking out, please make sure your personal credit card was
not charged for room and tax.
Note* If you utilize a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous
expenses, a hold may be put on your card in a set amount for the
duration of the stay.
The District will reimburse Directors the actual cost of lodging which

get them there in time for the Sunday meeting start. Directors must
provide itemized receipts that provide the time, place and purpose for

requests for meals by the number of meals that are provided at the
conference. However, if the Director elects not to eat at the
conference or to have a business meeting with meals outside of the
paid event, the Director will be reimbursed assuming he can provide
itemized receipts and documentation of the RTD Transit related
purpose, time and place of such meeting including the name and
position of the person(s) attending.
Board and/or Committee Meetings may be arranged at the
convenience of Directors to coincide with meal times and shall be a

such time as an opinion is rendered or refused. If you are invited to a dinner or meal
where the expected value exceeds $50.00, please offer to pay for your own meal.
