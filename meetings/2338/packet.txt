Award Contract for the Supply of 36 Mall
Shuttle Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract with BYD Motors, Inc. for
the supply of 36 – 45’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare components in an amount not to exceed
$27,100,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has initiated the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance mall shuttle sub-fleet.
RTD’s existing TransTeq mall shuttle buses are currently between 14 and 15 years old. They have
exceeded their service life of 12 years, become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep
them in service. Some of the mall buses have experienced structural fatigue failure or other major
problems that have kept them out of service. The bus manufacturer, TransTeq, went out of business
over 10 years ago. Many of the parts required for the repair of the buses are no longer available. The
current mall bus fleet is not sustainable for continued passenger service.
The mall shuttle buses are unique because of the many unique features necessary for the bus operation
in the pedestrian mall environment, such as right hand operator position, 45’ in length, 3 to 4 wide
passenger doors, completely low and flat floor, etc. Industry standard bus manufacturers, such as Gillig
and New Flyer, do not have such bus type in production and do not want to expend their resources in
the engineering and manufacture of the buses because of their low potential sales volume. A small
number of specialty bus manufacturers that produced the mall bus type in the past, such as TransTeq
and DesignLine, went out of business after a short time in existence. To allow more bids for the supply
of the new mall buses, RTD opened up the procurement process not only to domestic market suppliers
but also to the larger international market. Only two companies, both international, submitted their
proposals. No high-volume legacy US bus manufacturer’s submitted proposals. Other international bus
manufacturers that could produce buses meeting RTD requirements did not submit their proposals
because of the high cost to bring the foreign-produced buses into compliance with the US vehicle safety
regulations.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FK-005 in June of 2014. Two proposals were received on
September 9, 2014. Shaw International, Inc. proposed conventional CNG buses, and BYD Motors, Inc.
proposed fully electric buses. The proposed pricing is listed below.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Shaw International, Inc. – CNG Buses
BYD Motors, Inc. – Electric Buses

$666,855 per bus
$748,051 per bus

Shaw International is a distributor for King Long Bus of China. King Long Bus is one of China’s largest
coach and bus manufacturers, annually producing 25,000 buses and over 30,000 mini vans. The
proposed buses would be produced entirely in China and imported into the US.
BYD Motors is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BYD Ltd, which is 50% US owned through shareholders.
Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway is the company’s single largest shareholder with 9.9%. BYD is a
large international corporation established in 1995 with over 200,000 employees worldwide. BYD is the
world’s largest manufacturer of rechargeable batteries. It is also the largest Chinese auto manufacturer
and the world’s largest electric bus manufacturer. BYD produces over 1000 electric buses a year. BYD
has built buses similar to the mall buses with the driver position on the right for countries that have
adopted the British road rule. BYD proposed the bus chassis to be built in China, and shipped to its final
assembly plant in Lancaster, California for completing the manufacturing process. The BYD buses will
meet all US vehicle safety standards and Buy America Requirements.
Staff has evaluated the two proposals based on several criteria such as costs for initial purchase and
lifetime operation, compliance with RTD technical requirements, company’s technical and manufacturing
ability and its experience in the US transit bus market.
Costs:
Staff has performed a life cycle cost analysis of the two proposed buses to determine which bus power
configuration would result in the most cost effective, energy efficient and best value proposal.
The electric bus provides the best energy cost efficiency. Over the 12-year life span, it is estimated the
electric bus would yield a savings of $99,956, at current prices, in energy consumption over the CNG
buses. This savings would more than offset the bus purchase cost difference of $81,196. In addition,
the electric bus would eliminate many major bus components such as engine and transmission and allow
additional savings in maintenance and repair cost. The cost of ownership to include bus purchase and
operating costs over the 12-year life of the electric bus would be $139,500 per bus less than those of
the proposed CNG buses. Both power systems require modifications to the maintenance facility;
however, the cost to modify RTD’s Platte maintenance facility for operating the electric buses is
estimated at only half the cost to upgrade the CNG fuel station for operating the CNG buses,
at$405,000 for electric buses vs. $900,000 for CNG buses.

In addition, the proposed BYD electric bus cost is equally competitive to the cost, inflation adjusted, of
the diesel electric hybrid bus in previous mall bus purchases. It is lower than the RTD internal cost
estimate. It is also within the RTD existing budget for unit bus cost.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Technical Specifications:
The BYD proposed bus meets all of RTD’s technical requirements to include some desirable features
such as efficient use of the bus floorplan to allow a large passenger capacity of 111, full rear window,
passenger air conditioning, zero emissions and low noise, etc. The proposed King Long bus is less
efficient in passenger capacity caused by the large space occupied by the full sized CNG bus engine and
transmission connecting to a regular low floor rear axle. This results in a smaller passenger area behind
the rear axle. Its passenger capacity is 18% lower than the BYD electric bus, at 94 vs 111. The Shaw
proposed bus does not have a full sized rear window.
The electric bus is much cleaner and quieter than the CNG bus in terms of exhaust emission and noise
emission. The electric bus produces zero tailpipe emissions and is nearly silent. The CNG bus produces
higher exhaust and noise emissions. At this time, the bus industry appears to be headed toward an allelectric-bus future. In the past, the primary constraints to purchasing electric buses have been battery
capacity and cost. BYD has overcome both concerns. The BYD proposed system has demonstrated the
battery capacity to perform the mall duty cycle at a reasonable purchase cost. BYD has also eliminated a
major cost concern associated with the potential need to replace the expensive batteries, by offering a
12-year warranty on the batteries.
Bus Manufacturing Capability, Build Location and Experience in US Transit Bus Industry:
BYD buses will be assembled in Lancaster, CA. The bus build process is similar to the process employed
by a number of current bus manufacturers such as MCI and New Flyer. The bus chassis will be
manufactured outside of the US, in China, but the majority of the bus will be assembled in the US. By
being assembled in the US and containing 60% or more US contents, the proposed BYD buses will meet
the current Buy America Requirements. The BYD build process with final assembly in the US allows
RTD a greater degree of oversight during the manufacture process and faster responses to issues. As
part of its due diligence process, RTD staff has visited BYD plant in Lancaster, CA. Staff has verified
BYD’s capable bus manufacturing ability provided by its modern and efficient assembly facility.
The buses proposed by Shaw International would be built entirely in China. This provides significant
challenges for inspection, design verification, and issue resolution due to distance and language barrier.
BYD has a number of buses in service with various agencies in the US. It has recently delivered five
buses to Los Angeles MTA. It has won the contract award in Long Beach for 10 buses with options for
additional 50 buses. RTD has visited Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA) in California to review its
BYD bus operation. AVTA has two BYD buses in operation since last year. The buses have been reliable
and allowed more than 200 miles of service before needing a battery charge. In contrast, Shaw
International/King Long Bus has no buses in service in the US.

Conclusion:
The evaluation by Staff indicates the proposal by BYD as the best value, lowest risk proposal providing
the most advanced and clean power technology desirable for the 16th Mall Street operation at a
reasonable initial purchase cost and lowest lifetime operating cost. BYD has proposed an accelerated bus
production process. The first pilot bus is scheduled for completion of manufacturing and delivery for
testing and evaluation in April 2016. The rest of the buses are scheduled for completion between May
and September 2016.
The 45’ mall shuttle buses are fully low and flat floor with three wide passenger doors for ease of
passenger boarding and de-boarding. For safety reasons, they have the driver platform on the right
hand side similarly to existing mall buses. They will be equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two
wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their clean battery electric power system
produces zero vehicle exhaust emissions. The buses will have a passenger air conditioning system to
improve passenger comfort. They will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a
security digital camera system. They can carry up to 111 passengers to meet the heavy demand of
mall service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This mall shuttle purchase was included in the adopted 2015 Amended Budget by a carryforward and
new capital totaling $24,147,350. The remaining amount needed to complete the purchase will be
funded by a FASTER grant of $3.9 million that became available subsequent to approval of the Amended
Budget, providing for total available funding of $28M. The FASTER grant requires an equal match of
$3.9 million from local funds that will come from the budgeted $24,147,350. The $405,000 needed to
modify the maintenance facility to accommodate the enhanced charging needs associated with the
electric buses has been requested as part of the 2016 requested budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, BYD has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to award the contract to BYD for the purchase of 3645’ mall shuttle buses and associated spare parts. This is the recommended alternative.
2. To award the contract to Shaw International/King Long Bus. This is not a recommended
alternative since the company has proposed CNG bus, requiring a higher cost of owner ship. It is
also a riskier alternative due to the lack of experience of the manufacturer in the US transit
market, its entire manufacturing process in China and its non-compliance with the Buy America
Requirements. This would also contradict the results of RTD’s procurement process.
3. Do not authorize the contract award and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it may result
in a no-bid situation in the repeated procurement process with limited qualified bidders, and at the
very least would result in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the
project. This would also result in increased problems with existing mall service due to the
difficulty in keeping the TransTeq mall buses in safe and reliable operation.

RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy Update

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the
attached advertising policy.
BACKGROUND
Currently, RTD operates an on-vehicle advertising program that accepts both commercial and non-commercial forms of
advertising. Under current policy, RTD’s advertising program creates a ‘limited public forum’ by which public service,
nonprofit and political advertisements are allowed within the guidelines established by the policy.
RTD’s Current Advertising Policy is as follows:
Advertising Policy and Objective:
It is the policy of the RTD to utilize space on the interior and exterior of its buses and light rail vehicles for commercial
advertising, RTD advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages. The primary objective of the
commercial advertising program is to maximize the net revenues to the District within the policy and standards of the
District.
Advertising Standards:
All advertising matter displayed on or in buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles shall be of a reputable character as
determined by the RTD. Objectionable advertisements shall, upon the request of a responsible officer of the RTD, be
removed immediately. All advertisements must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and Municipal laws,
ordinances and regulations within the District.
Political advertisements may be displayed only within six months of the election date. Said advertising must contain the
following disclaimer: "This Ad Paid for by (sponsor/advertiser)" and shall be subject to prior approval by RTD.
The following standards for advertising, as adopted by the RTD Board of Directors, shall be strictly adhered to by the
Advertising Company:
1. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is false, misleading, or deceptive;
2. The RTD will not display advertising copy which relates to any illegal activity under local, state or federal statute;
3. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is obscene;
4. Any advertisement not relating to a commercially available product or service including political advertising shall
include a clearly visible phrase "This Ad Paid for by (the identity of the sponsor/advertiser)". These ads shall be
subject to prior approval by the RTD; and
5. The RTD will not display advertising copy, which promotes the sale and/or use of tobacco products.
RTD has Non-Commercial Advertising Disclaimer Specifications under the current policy.
DISCUSSION
The proposed RTD Advertising Policy would establish uniform, reasonable, and viewpoint-neutral standards for the
display of advertising in and on the facilities, vehicles and other property (together "Property") of the Regional

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.3

Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and restrict the use of RTD's
Property for First Amendment political speech.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on the Property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary capacity as a
provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its transportation operations.
Starting from the Effective Date of the new Policy, the RTD does not intend that the advertising permitted to be
displayed in and on the Property be created, designated, or used as a public forum for expressive activities or
general discourse or opinions.
In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary capacity would be
limiting advertisements it will accept for display in and on the Property to paid commercial advertising, certain
public service announcements that will help provide information to the public about RTD’s own and other
government activities to help build goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the Property by subjecting all proposed
advertisements to the Advertising Standards included in the proposed RTD Advertising Policy. This proposed
advertising policy is attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is currently contracted with Lamar Advertising to receive a minimum guarantee of $4,000,000.00 in 2015,
$4,100,000.00 in 2016, and $4,200,000.00 in 2017 in advertising revenues. Non-commercial advertising accounts for
approximately $1,000,000.00 annually of those revenues. Adoption of the revised Advertising Policy may result in
an initial decrease of advertising revenue, as some advertisers will no longer qualify to participate in the RTD
Advertising program. Please also note that those advertisers are currently paying a lower rate for ads than the
commercial rate, and under the proposed updated policy, we will have only one rate. Staff also observes that some
non-commercial advertisers will be able to participate in the proposed advertising program as commercial
advertisers.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the attached proposed advertising policy. This alternative is the staff recommendation.
2. Retain the existing RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended due to the creation of
a ‘public forum’ on RTD property.

As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the
upcoming East and I-225 rail lines also known as the A Line and R Line respectively will
represent significant milestones in achieving improved connectivity and travel times for
RTD customers. Both projects are likely to stimulate residential, retail, and commercial
growth and contribute to increases in ridership within the corridors. The East and I-225
Corridor Service Plan contains recommendations for developing a restructured bus network
capable of meeting the demand and mobility needs generated by the expansion of
commuter rail and light rail services. Recommendations in this study were formulated
based on a comprehensive assessment of existing conditions, service area demographics,
transit market research, route performance and analysis, and stakeholder input. Data
collection activities included both on-site field work and stakeholder meetings held with
RTD and FasTracks personnel.

Study Area

The study area of this project is defined by 104th Avenue to the north, Tower Road and
DIA to the east, Hampden Avenue to the south, and downtown Denver to the west. The
study area includes the cities of Aurora and Denver.
Map 1 - A Line Rail Alignment

The A Line is a new 22.8-mile electrified commuter rail line that will operate between
Denver Union Station and Denver International Airport (DIA) with connections to adjacent
employment centers, neighborhoods, and development areas in the City of Denver and
Aurora. The A Line will serve seven stations, including Denver Union Station, 38th/Blake,
40th/Colorado, Central Park, Peoria, 40th Ave & Airport Blvd/Gateway Park, and DIA.
Total travel time between Denver Union Station and DIA is approximately 35 minutes.

East Corridor Transit Operations Plan (2009)

The East Corridor Transit Operations Plan contains bus and rail operations plans related to
the environmental benefits, costs, and impacts of the proposed service alternatives
between downtown Denver and DIA. Existing transit service descriptions and
characteristics of the corridor and corresponding routes are provided.
In 1997, the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) completed a Major
Investment Study for the East Corridor and recommended a rail alternative for the corridor.
Subsequent analysis of the corridor indicated that the electric multiple unit (EMU)
commuter rail cars with maximum operating speeds of 50 to 79 miles per hour would
provide the greatest benefit. Travel times between downtown Denver and DIA, based on
speed limits, performance characteristics of the EMU vehicle, track alignment, and station
dwell time, are expected to be 35 minutes one-way. The line is currently under
construction, the new rail cars have been ordered, and it is expected to be operational in
2016.
The rail operations service plan includes the following proposed service frequency levels on
the A Line:

Ridership estimates were developed for the A-Line based on DRCOG modeling scenarios
that accounted for various transit investments and incorporated the factors of land use,
development, parking, fare structure, and vehicle load standards. Other inputs included
demographic information such as projected population, employment, and income. The

Additionally, mode of access to each station was projected to determine the method by
which rail passengers are expected to arrive at the station. The stations of 40th &
Colorado and 40th Ave & Airport Blvd stations are the only stations projected to have
more the 50% of passengers accessing the station via automobile, while passengers at all
other stations access the station by walking or taking transit. Notably, the station at
Peoria is expected to have a 58% share of access from the R-Line light rail line.

The R-Line light rail alignment will connect the existing Nine Mile Station with the new
Peoria Station and A-Line commuter rail service. Existing light rail service in the I-225
Corridor is currently provided on the H-Line from Nine Mile Station to the 18th/California
Station in downtown Denver operating on a 15 minute all-day frequency. Under the
preferred operating scenario, the H-Line would be extended beyond the Nine Mile Station
to serve the two future R-Line stations at Iliff and Florida. Service on the R-Line would
operate between Peoria Station and Lincoln Station on the Southeast Corridor.

For light rail vehicles operated by RTD, the maximum speed will be 55 miles per hour;
however, actual operating speed may vary somewhat due to final track alignment, speed
restrictions, and track design. Travel time simulations resulted in the following one-way
trip times.

The DRCOG ridership model projected average daily boardings by station for the future
year of operation of 2035. The stations at Peoria, Aurora Metro Center, and Iliff are
expected to generate the greatest ridership. The data for the Fitzsimons Station is out-ofdate as the alignment of the R-Line has been restructured to continue along Fitzsimons
Parkway and will no longer provide an on-site station at the medical center complex. The
closest station to the medical center complex will now be Colfax Station. Projections for
the Fitzsimons Station are not considered to be reliable due to this change.

Mode of access to each station was projected to determine the method by which rail
passengers are expected to arrive at the station. The stations of 13th Ave, 2nd &
Abilene, and Iliff are the only stations projected to have more the 50% of passengers
accessing the station via automobile, while passengers at all other stations access the
station by walking or taking transit. Notably, the station at Peoria is expected to have a
59% share of access from the A-Line commuter rail line.

Existing Conditions
3.1. Existing Market Conditions

The following market assessment presents an overview of the population demographics
and characteristics of each corridor and was used to identify areas that are more prone to
transit use. Demographic characteristics incorporated into this assessment include income,
ethnicity, car ownership, and senior populations. Additionally, the population and
employment densities within the corridors were used to determine the location of high
density trip generators and potential ridership patterns.

3.2.

Population and Employment Density

Population densities in the East and I-225 Corridors are on average higher than elsewhere
in the Denver region. The greater population densities exhibited in these corridors is due to
Denver and Aurora’s land use policies and historic character, which has led to dense
housing developments and a greater concentration of people. Notable areas of high
population density include downtown Denver, areas immediately surrounding Cherry
Creek, Colfax Avenue in Denver, Sable Blvd. in Aurora, and Iliff Avenue in Aurora. Colfax
Avenue represents the strongest corridor for density in the study area, outside of
downtown Denver. South of Colfax Avenue, densities become more spread out with
pockets of dense populations in different neighborhoods. Population density in the East
Corridor drops off along the Interstate 70 alignment but becomes stronger in the
neighborhoods of Montbello and Green Valley Ranch near Gateway Park. The I-225
Corridor exhibits greater densities east of Interstate 225, particularly in the areas
surrounding the Aurora City Center.
Employment density in the study area is highest in downtown Denver and adjacent
neighborhoods. Other prominent areas of high density employment include the warehouse

district west of Montbello, Gateway Park located east of Montbello, Cherry Creek, and
Colorado Blvd. located southeast of downtown, Parker Road located west of Nine Mile
Station, and Sable Blvd. located east of Interstate 225. The East Corridor exhibits strong
employment densities resulting from the industrial and warehouse businesses that
surround the current freight alignment heading east from downtown Denver to beyond the
city limits. I-225 Corridor employment densities are retail focused with big box retailers
and the Town Center at Aurora shopping center, as well as the commercial businesses
adjacent to the existing Nine Mile Station.
Montbello Industrial Park is the largest industrial submarket in Denver, containing over 70
million square feet of warehouse space. It is located along the I-70 industrial corridor
between downtown Denver and DIA. Surrounding amenities include the Stapleton
residential and retail development along with Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, which is home
to the Colorado Rapids professional soccer team. Gateway Park is an office and industrial
complex near DIA at Interstate 70 and Peña Boulevard.
Cherry Creek is located near the geographic center of the City and County of Denver and
is a mixture of dense urban development and residential streets. The Cherry Creek
shopping and dining district is a 16 city-block area with more than 320 galleries, retail
storefronts, restaurants, and the Fillmore Plaza.
Colorado Boulevard is a major arterial road of east Denver that runs in a north-south
direction and intersects both Interstate 70 and Interstate 25. Much of the road is devoted
to commercial development, including both office and residential high rises. It passes along
the east side of Denver City Park and is served by RTD Route 40. See Map 3 for
population and employment densities.

3.3.

Customer Demographics

Income
The low-income populations are most concentrated in the areas of downtown Denver,
Montbello, and along major arterial roadways including Colfax Ave, Mississippi Ave, Peoria
Street, and Chambers Road. The A-Line stations of 38th & Blake, 40th & Colorado and
Peoria are in the closest proximity to higher concentrations of low income persons. While
all R-Line stations have a low-income population located nearby, the stations of Colfax,
13th Ave, and Florida have the greatest concentration of low-income persons. See Map 4,
Population in Poverty.
Minorities
Minority populations in the study area are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of
downtown Denver, Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, and along the major arterial roadways
of Colfax Ave and Mississippi Ave. These areas were recognized and will be taken into
account when developing the service plan recommendations. See Map 5, Minority
Populations.
Senior Population
The senior population is concentrated in various areas throughout the study area including
areas along Alameda Avenue (Windsor Gardens) and Colorado Blvd., and in the area
adjacent to Nine Mile Station. See Map 6, Senior Citizens.

Service Evaluation

An assessment of the existing transit service is essential for understanding a route’s role
within the larger transit network and for analyzing individual route performance against the
service standard metrics. Included in this assessment is a ridership review that helped to
identify boarding activity and ridership trends.

4.1.

Existing Service Conditions

4.1.1. Transit Route Network
RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route
alignment, and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from
the performance of all routes within each class. RTD conducts an annual route review
using the performance indicators of subsidy per boarding and boardings per hour.
Routes in the East and I-225 Corridors fall into one of the following categories: Central
Business District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, Express, or SkyRide. CBD
Local routes provide direct, one-seat trips into or through downtown Denver, while Urban
Local routes operate on major streets and provide connections to the greater RTD network
outside of the downtown core. Suburban Local routes offer transit coverage to some of
the less developed communities in the far reaches of the service area. Express routes
provide peak-only service between outlying communities and downtown Denver, while
SkyRide routes provide premium fare one-seat rides to DIA from regional transit nodes.
The East Corridor is served by a significant number of routes from five different route
classes. Local routes in this corridor typically operate on a 15-minute peak frequency with
a 30-minute off-peak frequency. In addition, there are a number of routes that provide
SkyRide service to DIA. Park-n-Ride facilities at 30th/Downing Station, Stapleton,
Montbello, and Airport Blvd/40th Ave are within the corridor and located nearby to the
future A-Line stations. See Map 8, SkyRide Routes.

The I-225 Corridor is served entirely by local routes providing a wide range of coverage
across the RTD network. Routes typically operate on a 15 minute peak and 30 minute offpeak frequencies. Transit facilities and destinations in this corridor include
Centrepoint/Sable, Nine Mile Station, and the Anschutz Medical Campus. Routes
connecting to the station at Peoria, shared by the A-Line and R-Lines, are listed under the
A-Line (Table 4).

4.1.2. Transit Service Levels
Transit service levels include frequency and span. Frequency refers to how often a route
runs and span refers to the hours and days of operation. Transit service levels are often
dictated by a number of factors, the most important being actual usage, i.e. market
demand. Increased demand for transit often translates into an increased supply of service
with better frequencies, longer spans, and multiple days of operation. Similarly, less
demand usually translates into less service. Other contributing factors that influence
transit service levels include connections to key destinations, historical precedent, regional
significance, and operating agreements.

Map 8 - Skyride Services

1.C.2.a

In the RTD route network, frequency is broken down into three categories: spontaneoususe (15 minutes or less), coordinated (30 minutes), and lifeline (60 minutes or more).
Spontaneous-use frequencies minimize passenger wait times and eliminate the need for
passengers to plan their trips in advance around the schedule which ultimately attracts
more riders making routes more cost-effective. CBD Local and Urban Local routes often
possess frequencies that facilitate spontaneous use.
Coordinated frequencies require passengers to coordinate their trips in advance to arrive
and depart in a fashion that will minimize wait times and reduce their overall travel time.
Coordinated frequencies are often found on routes that cannot support spontaneous-use
frequencies but have enough demand to support greater service levels than the lifeline
frequencies.
Lifeline frequencies provide transit coverage to areas that cannot support higher
frequencies. These services are often used to expand the transit service area to provide
access to outlying communities. Focusing efforts on lifeline coverage does not typically
grow ridership but can provide critical mobility for many passengers located in low density
markets. Suburban Local routes often have lifeline frequencies. Routes that provide “trips”
rather than a regular frequency are often the result of commute oriented travel patterns
where transit demand is not sufficient enough to warrant midday service or regular service
frequencies.
East Corridor
In the East Corridor, spontaneous use frequencies are found south of Interstate 70 on
three east-west CBD Local Routes. These are Routes 28, 38, and 44 which serve
Stapleton and downtown Denver. Other spontaneous use frequency routes are found on
the north-south roadways of Colorado Boulevard, Havana Street, Peoria Street, and
Chambers Road. All other routes in the East Corridor have coordinated frequencies and are
concentrated in the areas north of Interstate 70 and within close proximity to DIA.
Interestingly, Montbello has several routes (43, 44, 45, and 153) in very close proximity
to each other with coordinated frequencies and is a candidate for consolidation with
spontaneous use frequencies on fewer routes.

Weekday Frequency

1.C.2.a

Span of service in the RTD network often varies by service class and is based on service
policy and ridership demand. A wider service span gives passengers greater flexibility
when planning their trips and encourages ridership at different hours of the day to meet
varying passenger needs, but conversely increases cost.
CBD Local and Urban Local routes typically begin weekday service between 4:00 AM to
5:00 AM. The end of service, however, varies greatly with some routes ending service
around 10:00 PM and others ending service at 2:00 AM the next day.
Suburban Local routes typically begin weekday service between 4:00 AM and 5:00 AM
with service ending between 7:00 PM and 11:00 PM.
Express routes provide peak-only service for the early morning commute and again in the
afternoon to meet the demand of commuters traveling to and from large employment
centers.
SkyRide routes typically begin weekday service at 3:00 AM with service ending around
1:00 AM the next day.
The East Line Corridor is served predominantly by CBD Local and Urban Local routes with
greater frequencies and spans. CBD Local Routes 28, 38, and 44 have 15 minute
frequencies during weekday peak periods and 30 to 60 minutes during off-peak weekdays
and weekends. All Urban Local Routes operate weekdays and weekends at frequencies of
15, 30, or 60 minutes except Route 54 which serves the Montbello Industrial Park on
weekdays only. The corridor is intersected with Route 40 which travels north-south and
provides service along the major arterial road of Colorado Boulevard. This route connects
with the Southeast Rail Line further south of the East Corridor. The East Corridor is also
served by express Route 47X. Route 47X is entirely within the East Corridor.
The I-225 Corridor is served primarily by CBD and Urban Local routes. CBD Local Routes
provide on-peak and off-peak service to and from downtown Denver with Route 15
remaining operational throughout the week with 24-hour service. Urban Local Routes in
this corridor typically operate at frequencies of 15, 30, or 60 minutes throughout the day.
Only Route 89 operates only on weekdays as most labs and educational facilities in the
Fitzsimons Life Science District and Anschutz Medical Campus remain closed during the
weekends.

4.1.5. Performance
Route performance is essential in developing appropriate service plan recommendations as
resources need to be invested to optimize performance and maximize ridership.
Performance is measured in productivity; how efficient the service is provided in regards to
expenditure and how effective the service is at accomplishing its intended objectives.
Productivity increases as market demand begins to match the current supply of service
and productivity decreases when the supply of service exceeds the market demand.

4.1.4. Span of Service

Although the market for transit cannot be controlled 1, poor market conditions can be
mitigated through service and network design choices. Matching transit service levels,
including frequency and span, with the transit market demand is one way to strengthen
service productivity.

RTD conducts an annual route review using performance indicators such as subsidy per
boarding. The subsidy per boarding measurement determines the portion of the operating
cost, after subtracting fare revenues, that RTD pays on a per passenger boarding basis.
Routes with a higher subsidy per boarding cost more to operate and therefore, perform
worse than routes with a lower subsidy per boarding. Potential methods to improve
subsidy per boarding include lowering operating costs by reducing route frequency and
span. This will decrease the number of buses, drivers, pay hours, and service miles
required to operate a route but can also reduce ridership. Another method to improve
subsidy per boarding is to increase ridership and revenue through route alignment, route
consolidation, or route deviation. Additional ridership and revenue can also be generated
by marketing the service, improving operating characteristics such as on-timeperformance, safety, reliability, and route network integration with other transit services.
Improvements in scheduling can often result in reduced operating costs, improved service
efficiency and reliability.

RTD through collaboration with its member cities and counties can support changes that influence
mobility choice. For instance, current RTD support of sustainable community Smart Growth
initiatives that foster transit oriented development develop “transit lifestyle” markets where transit,
biking, and walking play stronger roles in public mobility.

Based on RTD Service Standards, the bottom 10% performing routes by each service class are
evaluated for possible consolidation, realignment or improved marketing.

Boardings per Hour
RTD also uses the boardings per revenue hour metric to measure route performance. The
boardings per revenue hour calculation measures the average number of passenger
boardings per hour of revenue service. Routes that generate higher boardings per hour
represent more productive routes where market demand (boardings) is balanced with the
supply of service (revenue hours). If demand increases, but supply remains the same, then
productivity will increase. If supply increases, but demand remains the same, then
productivity will decrease. By balancing the supply of service with the market demand,
transit providers can generate the greatest return on their investment by reducing
operating costs and associated subsidies – RTD has service standards policies that address
both high and low performing routes. Following is service productivity for bus routes
within the East and I-225 corridors.

Within the East Corridor, the bus lines that go through downtown Denver underperform
compared to similar services operated by RTD. The lines travel from the West side of the
region through downtown Denver and then into the East side of the metro area. Because
the entire line is not within the study area for the East Corridor, these routes were
segmented to perform a more detailed analysis. The 47X Express service on the other
hand is located solely within the East Corridor study area. This service travels through
Green Valley Ranch and Montbello as a local service before merging onto I-70 as an
express line. The 47X has 50% worse productivity when compared to other express
routes in the RTD system and runs a route similar to the A-Line. It is expected that
ridership will decline significantly once A-Line rail service opens making its ongoing
retention tenuous.
There are also three bus lines in the study area that primarily serve DIA (AT, AS, and AF).
The 169L also serves DIA, but primarily serves communities along the R-Line Corridor.
This line performs well but has very low revenue service hours.

The Urban Local bus services in this corridor have an average boarding per revenue hour of
36 which is just above the average for the region, 35. Some lines do well in particular
such as the 105 which has 46 boardings per revenue hour. This line travels from Denver
Tech Center in the south to Stapleton (Central Park) in the north. On the other hand, bus
lines such as the 45 and 54 have boardings per hour of 17 and 19 respectively. Both
these services are north of the East Corridor in the Montbello and Green Valley Ranch
neighborhoods and have circuitous routes.

Transit lines that serve the I-225 Corridor perform better than comparable services within
the RTD Service Area. In particular the 15 and 15L (limited) lines have very good
performance with 57 and 73 boardings per hour, respectively. They both travel along
Colfax Avenue from Aurora to downtown Denver. The performance of these lines can
largely be attributed to the nature of the corridor and neighborhoods they serve. Colfax
Avenue is a heavily travelled corridor and holds some of the highest density tracts in the
region. The Suburban Local Lines 130 and 133 also do well with above average boardings
per hour. Both of these lines start at the Nine Mile Station on the H Line Light Rail and end
near the Aurora Town Center which is a major destination. Finally the Urban Local Lines 3,
21, and 121 all perform above the RTD average as well. The 121 line connects the H Light
Rail Line to the south, runs along Peoria, and ends in the Montbello neighborhood to the
north. The neighborhoods that this line passes through are high density, and contain low
income populations that are more likely to take transit.
Farebox Recovery
Farebox recovery is the ratio of fare revenue to operating costs. It indicates the percentage
of operating costs covered by passenger boarding revenue. The higher the farebox
recovery, the lower the subsidy a route requires to operate, leaving more funding available
to operate more service. Routes with a high farebox recovery ratio have the greatest share

of the operating cost paid by passengers. SkyRide offers the most productive service as a
result its high fare structure, high demand from DIA to key destinations, and speed of
service. Express routes represent the second most productive service class in this category
due to the strong ridership, higher fare of $4.00 instead of the local fare of $2.25, and
focused operating costs as a result of providing peak-only service. The farebox recovery
for the entire RTD system was 23.8% in 2012.

Productivity Analysis
Productivity varies greatly across service class. CBD Local and Urban Local routes
generate the best performance statistics due to the number of people carried on these
services. Identifying which routes are the most costly to run can help result in a more
efficient allocation of resources. Routes with strong financial effectiveness are candidates
for additional investment, while routes with weak financial effectiveness may be
candidates for service reduction or realignment.
RTD service standards state “the least productive 10% of routes based on either subsidy
per boarding or boardings per revenue hour need to be evaluated for marketing, revision,
or elimination.” These are noted below in Red.

East Corridor Route Performance
The East Corridor is primarily served by CBD Local and Urban Local Routes, which are
typically more productive due to their high frequencies and consistently strong ridership. In
the corridor, Routes 38, 40, 43, 105, 121, AB, AS, and AT perform best in the subsidy
per boarding category with each requiring a subsidy per boarding of less than $4.00. The
system-wide subsidy per boarding is $3.31 for Year 2012. Routes 45, 47X, 54, 145X,
169L, and AA require a greater subsidy than the group average and exceed the $6.00
subsidy per boarding and will require further analysis. All routes except 47X generate more
than 15 boardings per hour.
Of all the routes in the East Corridor, only Route 54 fails the subsidy per boarding 10%
service class standard. Route 54 is a loop that begins at the Montbello Park-n-Ride and
circulates through the Montbello Industrial Park. It serves a major employment, low
income, high minority area. The route operates clockwise in the morning and counterclockwise in the afternoon on weekdays only with frequencies of thirty minutes during
peak and off-peak periods.

I-225 Corridor Route Performance
The I-225 Corridor is served mainly by CBD Local and Urban Local Routes, which often
require a lower subsidy to operate and are typically more productive due to their high
frequencies and consistently strong ridership. Two routes (3L and 131) exceed the $6.00
subsidy per boarding compared to one in the East Corridor. All CBD and Urban Local
Routes in this corridor exceed 15 boardings per hour. In the corridor, Routes 3, 6, 10, 11,
15, 15L, 20, 21, and 121 perform best in the subsidy per boarding category with each
requiring a subsidy per boarding of less than $4.00. The system-wide subsidy per boarding
figure was $3.31 for Year 2012.
Of all the routes in the I-225 Corridor, only Routes 3L and 131 fail the subsidy per
boarding 10% service standard class. Route 3L is a CBD local (limited stop) route traveling
from the Civic Center Station to East Ohio Drive/Alameda Parkway in Aurora. Route 131 is
a suburban local route traveling from the Nine Mile LRT Station in Aurora to East Jewell
Avenue/South Dunkirk Street in Aurora. Both of these routes operate weekdays only
during peak periods. The higher subsidy for Route 131 is a result of the less productive
suburban market ridership as compared with Urban Local and CBD local routes. Route 3L
runs one direction during the peak period only which may help explain the higher subsidy.

East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan

Building upon RTD’s significant investments in transit, the addition of rail service in the
East and I-225 Corridors is another major step forward in developing a comprehensive and
seamless transit network for the people of the greater Denver area. However, rail service
is only part of the overall transit improvements envisioned for these corridors. The bus
network which carries the vast majority of transit riders was evaluated and
recommendations were made to complement the additional rail service with direct and
convenient access to the new rail stations. Recommendations were also made to the bus
network to enhance intra-corridor mobility and to strengthen connectivity to urban and
suburban regional destinations while improving operational efficiency and the rider’s
experience.

5.1.

Plan Framework and Strategies

To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of limited operating
resources, it was imperative that the recommendations were congruent with RTD’s vision
for a regionally integrated transit network that will improve mobility, enhance economic
competitiveness, reduce congestion and pollution, and will ultimately retain existing riders
while continuing to attract new ones. The service recommendations not only focus on
enhancing operating efficiency and improving transit network effectiveness, but also aim
to make transit the region’s mode of choice.
The Existing Conditions findings from the ridership analysis, service performance, and
market conditions also informed the development of guiding principles which served as the
framework for the service plan. The framework and strategies guided the development of
the plan recommendations from both a “top-down” network-level perspective as well as a
route-level “bottom-up” perspective.

5.2.

Network Design Strategies

Transit system success is built over a network, not by individual bus route or rail line. The
critical goal for the East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan is to build a simple, easy-to-use
network that is comprised of a family of bus and rail service tiers, all focusing on
delivering the overall network experience desired by existing and potential customers.
Leverage Rail Investment
RTD has made a significant investment in new rail alignments to improve regional mobility.
These investments will help shape land use patterns, enhance the competitive advantage
of the region, reduce congestion and pollution, and improve the livability and vibrancy of
the area. However, new rail infrastructure alone can’t accomplish these goals. Investments
in rail infrastructure must be leveraged and seamlessly integrated into RTD’s larger
network of transit services.
The East Corridor offers new fast regional train service between downtown Denver and
Denver International Airport (DIA) and provides new network opportunities. The I-225
Corridor Rail completes the connection between the East and the Southeast Corridors and
also opens new network opportunities for both rail and bus transit. As a result, the
adjacent or intersecting bus routes should be considered for realignment to serve the new
rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service reallocated, and bus route alignment
changes made to refocus network coverage. Through these actions, an integrated transit

5.

1.C.2.a

Strengthen Bus Service Tiers
RTD has a number of bus tiers which are defined by their target markets and service
characteristics. The East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan further differentiate the network
and corridor target markets between “transit lifestyle” and “coverage” markets. Service
designed for sustainable lifestyle consumers focuses on spontaneous-use frequencies of
10-15 minutes throughout the day and week that allow consumers to walk-up and catch
the next trip without planning their arrival at the stop. These spontaneous use corridors
will form the top tier of arterial bus transit and are good candidates for future
infrastructure investment to enhance the wait (upgraded stops) and travel experience
(reduced delay; improved reliability) for customers.
Lifestyle areas require development densities high enough to sustain these service levels
productively (meeting RTD standards) together with community orientation that facilitates
transit, walking, and biking active mobility. Coverage transit markets are those where
densities and community design are focused on automobile travel, which makes significant
transit mode penetration not possible and/or cost-effective. The proposed plan focuses
increased service frequency investment to network areas and corridors that support
lifestyle transit while tailoring transit options for coverage service areas.
Route Spacing and Prioritization
Where multiple routes operate along shared or parallel corridors, route consolidation or
prioritizing was evaluated in order to create a more robust transit service with greater
frequency that adds value to riders and supports spontaneous network use. Routes
operating along the same or adjacent corridors usually compete for the same riders,
reducing the effectiveness and increasing the net cost of service of each route. By
consolidating or prioritizing routes, limited resources can be reinvested within the transit
network to provide more direct, faster, and reliable service. For example, instead of
operating three 20 minute service routes in parallel, the plan looks to operate one at 10 or
15 minutes with the other two at 30 or 60 minutes. 3 In many instances, the middle route
operates on a major arterial and can be a candidate for infrastructure enhancement to
reduce delay and improve the customer experience - this investment has more ridership
and performance return on streamlined corridors with higher service levels.
Alternative First/Last Mile Transit
In most cases, network transit mobility is best served using regular fixed route bus service.
In some cases where the mobility needs are more limited (e.g., work or school commuting;
senior mobility) or where development intensity is too low to productively support regular
fixed route bus service, alternative mobility options are appropriate. The East and I-225
Corridor Service Plan considered more cost-effective alternatives in such instances
3

Research in many cities has documented that corridor prioritizing generates more overall ridership
for the same resource cost because more consumers are attracted. They walk further to better bus
transit with the average access for basic local bus at ¼ mile (80th percentile ridership catchment)
while for enhanced frequent bus this walk shed increases to ½ mile attracting more riders.

34
Packet Pg. 74

Attachment: East_& I-225 Corridors Preliminary Service Plan (2477 : Proposed East & I-225 Corridors Service Plan)

network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce operating costs, and strengthen
regional and community mobility.

including Call-n-Rides, station-based vanpools or car-sharing, home-to-work vanpools, or
private shuttles – especially for the dispersed light industry development adjacent to the I70 and the East Rail Corridors. Existing express services should be reconfigured as firstmile connectors to the nearest rail station where current ridership is low or where the rail
connection offers improved service frequency and/or travel time. RTD should consider
remote PnRs rather than walk-up access to improve performance of these first-mile
replacement services where densities are insufficient to support productive transit.

5.3.

Route Design Strategies

To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of its operating
resources, it is important to ensure that not only is there a coherent vision for a complete
transit network, but that individual routes can attract ridership as well. The following route
design strategies focus not only maintaining high operating efficiency, but providing an
improved customer experience that will attract more riders and operating revenue, thus
improving effectiveness as well.
Route Streamlining
Deviating routes from the main transit corridors reduces the walking distance and makes
transit more attractive to small numbers of riders but makes it significantly less attractive
to large numbers of riders using the main corridor. The result is fewer total riders at higher
operating cost. 4 The East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan calls for limiting deviations to
areas that can justify the additional travel time and costs by high ridership on the deviation
– areas such as rail stations, transit hubs, and major destinations in order make individual
routes, as well as the transit network, more productive and attractive to riders. In cases
where the deviation was providing needed lifeline coverage, alternative service was
proposed while also proposing streamlined corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their
alignments. Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate
more ridership than areas with lower densities. For example, Route 21 serves the Iliff and
Evans Avenues corridor where ridership is much stronger between the Southwest Rail
Station (Delaware) and the Centrepoint & Sable Hub in Aurora, making short-lining more
service on the eastside a cost-effective solution.

4

RTD’s out-of-direction standard calls for deviations to have less than 3 minutes increased travel
time impact to through-passengers for each rider served on the deviation to avoid total route
ridership loss. Also, deviations typically cost more to operate due to increased mileage and slower
off-route operating speeds.

35
Packet Pg. 75

Attachment: East_& I-225 Corridors Preliminary Service Plan (2477 : Proposed East & I-225 Corridors Service Plan)

1.C.2.a

Stop Consolidation
One of the greatest sources of operating delay and on-time performance impacts is dwell
time at bus stops. While closely-spaced bus stops increase the ease in which riders can
access the transit system that convenience comes at the expense of operating speed and
service reliability. Closely spaced stops not only impact route performance, increase stop
maintenance costs, and accelerate bus maintenance costs, but they can significantly
reduce the competitiveness of the service. By finding an optimal balance of stop spacing
to maintain convenient access to transit service while reducing potential for delay, the
efficiency and effectiveness of transit can be increased significantly.
While stop
consolidation is not proposed per se as part of the East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan, it
is recommended that RTD continue its stop consolidation program throughout the bus
network.
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it is
more intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the corridor
continuously. If general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of through
travel relative to local mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and destinations
together were consolidated to increase rider convenience by eliminating or reducing
transfers required to complete their trip along a natural transit corridor. In some cases this
results in restructuring the corridor into routes with consistent roles: one is streamlined to
serve the main arterial with frequent service while one or more are designed to serve the
neighborhood interior with less direct service where walk access to the main corridor is
not feasible. An example of this is reorienting service on MLK (Route 43) as the key
enhanced fast direct transit corridor (15-minute service to downtown Denver) while Route
38 becomes the neighborhood route connecting to the 30th & Downing Rail Station with
30-minute service.
Route Segmentation
In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high
proportion of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those
routes into two distinct routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or scheduling
efficiency was evaluated. This was primarily due to the low number of riders remaining on
the bus and traveling through the point in question. These actions also resulted in routes
with more balanced service levels on either side of this midpoint based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance
appeared to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route
service were considered. These alternative mobility options included Call-n-Rides, special
shuttles (destination), service routes (tailored for specific trip-making, e.g., seniors), or
commute oriented programs (e.g., station vans, car/bike sharing). These options maintain
service coverage mobility while reducing RTD’s net subsidy.

Route Recommendations

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
• The deviation into Havana & Alameda Park-n-Ride will be discontinued. Passengers
may instead use stops on Alameda, only 300 feet away.
• Service through Cherry Creek will be straightened out to operate, from Steele
Street, via Bayaud Avenue and Colorado Blvd. to Alameda Avenue, then resume
the current route. This routing provides convenient access for the neighborhoods
between Steele Street and Colorado Blvd., while also providing more direct service
for through passengers.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
• Service east of Aurora Metro Center Station (Centrepoint & Sable) to Ohio/Buckley
will be discontinued. Ridership east of Sable Blvd. averages 34 passengers/day, or
5 passengers/trip. Excellent service is available via Route 133 with 15 minute peak
frequency and 30 minute frequency at all other times of the day, and provides
convenient connection opportunities at Aurora Metro Center Station.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue SPLIT
• Route 6 is proposed to be split into two routes, Route 6-East 6th Avenue and Route
19-North Pecos: Route 6 will terminate at Denver Union Station, accessed via
Wewatta Street and 18th Street.
Route 6 routing will otherwise remain
unchanged.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
• It is proposed to discontinue Route 10 service east of the Community College of
Aurora to Buckley Air Force Base. Route 10 service to Buckley will be replaced by
proposed new Route 157. The new eastern terminal location for Route 10 will be
the Community College of Aurora – CentreTech Campus.
• Connect with R-Line light rail at the 2nd & Abilene Station by deviating by
Potomac, 2nd Avenue, Abilene Street, 4th Avenue, and Billings Street
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
• Discontinue the deviation via Cherry Street and Cherry Creek Drive South in
Glendale, instead operating directly via Mississippi Avenue. Most passenger
boardings occur one block north of Mississippi at Kentucky Avenue. Passengers at
Cherry Creek Drive may walk, or use Route 46.
• Reroute via Blackhawk Street instead of Abilene, between Mississippi and
Exposition Avenues.
Route 12 – Downing/North Washington
• Changes for August 2015: Eliminate northbound deviation into 30th & Downing
Station. Transferring passengers will instead use a new northbound bus stop at
Downing/29th Avenue, immediately across the street from the LRT Station. Saves
approximately 4 minutes for northbound through passengers.
Route 15 – East Colfax Avenue
• Changes for August 2015:
Discontinue deviation via Sable, 13th Avenue,
Chambers Road, and 17th Avenue. These deviations have excellent alternative
services available via Routes 15L, 20, and 153.
• Utilizing operational savings from discontinuing the above deviations, Route 15 will
be extended east of Chambers Road to Himalaya Street, replacing current Route
15L service.

Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
• Changes for August 2015: Discontinue weekday trips east of Sable Blvd to Tower
Road and Himalaya Street. These trips will instead terminate at Colfax/Billings
Street. Service east of Sable will be provided by newly extended Route 15 trips.
Route 19 - North Pecos
• Route 19 replaces Route 6 service on North Pecos St between downtown Denver
and Northglenn.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
• Changes for August 2015. Extend route east from 16th/Aurora Ct. (Anschutz
Medical Campus) via Colfax Ave. to Colfax/Billings St., in order to provide
connections with R-Line light rail service at the Colfax Station.
• Reroute eastbound trips from Lakewood as they enter downtown Denver, to use
Market Street instead of Wazee Street to 17th Street. Westbound trips destined
for Union Station will operate via Lawrence Street.
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
• Changes for August 2015: Reroute at Colorado Station via Monroe St. between
Evans Ave and Buchtel Blvd to avoid Colorado Blvd. traffic delay while maintaining
service connections.
• Route 21 will provide a direct connection with R-Line light rail service at the Aurora
Metro Center Station. Service will not deviate from Iliff Avenue at the Iliff Station,
instead passengers may utilize pedestrian connections between Iliff and the rail
platform.
• Sunday/holiday frequency will be improved from every 60 to every 30 minutes.
Route 24 – University Boulevard
• Eliminate the deviation via Race Street and Davies Avenue at the Streets at
Southglenn. University Blvd. provides equivalent access, while reducing travel time
for through passengers.
• Discontinue deviation via 47th Avenue through Swansea and Elyria neighborhoods.
Route 24 will instead operate directly east on 40th Avenue from York Street, to the
new 40th & Colorado Station for connections with A-Line rail service. Replacement
service in Swansea and Elyria will be provided by rerouted Route 44 service.
Route 28 – East 28th Avenue DISCONTINUED
• Route 28 service east of downtown Denver to Central Park Station will be
discontinued, due to low ridership and much more attractive nearby service
provided by Route 43. Alternative service is available by Route 43 on Martin
Luther King Blvd. two blocks north. Route 43 is proposed to be extended to
downtown Denver, eliminating the need to transfer to light rail or bus service at
30th & Downing Station. Alternative service is also available via Route 32 on 22nd
and 23rd Avenues west of Colorado Blvd., and by Route 20 on 23rd Avenue east
of Colorado Blvd. Route 28 service west of downtown Denver to northwest
Denver and Wheat Ridge will not be affected.
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue/City Park
• Route 32 weekday service will be cut back to 22nd Avenue/Colorado Blvd.,
eliminating the duplication with Route 40 between 22nd and 9th Avenues.
Saturday/Sunday/holiday service will be reestablished east of downtown Denver to

Customer Benefits and Impacts

When the recommendations are fully implemented, current transit riders will benefit from
better network connectivity, faster service, more frequency along major transit corridors,
and excellent access to new rail stations. These recommendations encompass 1,226,000
revenue hours, 14,599,400 revenue miles and 294 peak buses. While the net benefit is
substantial, there will be some riders that will have to walk further to reach fixed-route
transit service and a small number of riders that will no longer have transit service within
walking distance. Special care was taken to analyze and balance both customer benefits
as well as impacts during the development of the service recommendations.
Although certain routes were consolidated onto major streets to enhance corridor integrity
and improve travel times, many existing riders continue to be within walking distance of
the proposed RTD network. The rider impact walking analysis uses the street grid to more
accurately determine the number of existing riders impacted by proposed service changes.
The walking distance was ¼ mile access for bus stops and ½ mile access for rail stations.
This translates to a 5-minute and 10-minute walk, respectively.
The project team recommended several improvements to service frequencies. Nearly 40
percent of existing bus riders in the study area will be within a ¼ mile walk of more
frequent service.
Overall RTD ridership continues to grow as transit service offerings expand, service
delivery improves, and land use development patterns change. With the completion of the
A-Line and R-Line alignments in 2016, ridership growth will accelerate. To leverage RTD’s
investments in these rail alignments, bus routes adjacent to and intersecting with these rail
lines were evaluated to determine if route alignments and changes in frequency were
warranted to better serve the public. In some cases, bus routes were realigned and
frequencies enhanced to serve rail stations. In a few cases, routes or route segments
were recommended for elimination to reduce duplication between rail and bus services.
Where practical, bus routes on key transit corridors were strengthened with increased
frequency and improved directness. All of these efforts were aimed at attracting new
riders while improving service for existing riders.
With the implementation of new rail service, increased frequencies, and improvements in
bus operating efficiencies, overall carrying capacity in the East and I-225 corridors will

increase. More importantly, capacity will increase in key transit corridors where it is
needed the most. Based on an analysis of existing capacity, only one trip within the East
and I-225 corridor study area exceeds the load standard set by RTD. 5 The route 11
eastbound trip at 6:22am had a load factor of 147%. An additional bus at that time in that
direction would provide relief from overcrowding. Other trips such as Route 15L
westbound at 6:31am and 7:52am as well as Route 15 westbound at 6:38am had load
factors between 113% and 116%. These load factors are lower than the 125% threshold
set by RTD and the trips should be able to accommodate additional ridership growth. As
ridership continues to grow, more resources should be invested in these corridors to
relieve overcrowding issues that may develop.

According to RTD Performance Standards, the load standard for bus service is 125% of seated
capacity.

Introduction
1.1

Background and Focus

As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region,
the upcoming Gold Line and Northwest Line also known as the G-Line and B-Line
respectively will represent significant milestones in achieving improved connectivity
and travel times for RTD customers. Both projects are likely to stimulate residential,
retail, and commercial growth and contribute to increases in ridership within the
corridors. The Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan contains recommendations for
developing a restructured bus network capable of meeting the demand and mobility
needs generated by the expansion of commuter rail and light rail services.
Recommendations in this study were formulated based on a comprehensive
assessment of existing conditions, service area demographics, transit market research,
route performance and analysis, and stakeholder input. Data collection activities
included both on-site field work and stakeholder meetings held with RTD and
FasTracks personnel.
1.2

Study Area

The study area of this project is defined by the RTD West Line to the south, the US 36
& Broomfield Park-n-Ride to the north, Interstate 25 and downtown Denver to the east,
and the City of Golden to the west. The study area includes the cities of Arvada,
Denver, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat Ridge, as well as unincorporated areas in
Denver and Jefferson Counties.

The G-Line is a future 11.2-mile commuter rail line that will run along the BNSF
Railway and Union Pacific Railroad right of way from Denver Union Station (DUS) to
the City of Wheat Ridge. The G-Line will serve eight stations, including DUS, 41st/Fox,
Pecos Junction, Clear Creek/Federal, 60th & Sheridan/Arvada Gold Strike, Olde Town
Arvada, Arvada Ridge, and Wheat Ridge/Ward. The G-Line is expected to open in
2016. Total travel time between DUS and the Wheat Ridge/Ward terminal station is
approximately 25 minutes.

The B-Line is a future 41-mile commuter rail line from Denver Union Station (DUS) to
Longmont, passing through the Cities of Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder,
and Gunbarrel. Portions of the B-Line are adjacent to the US 36 BRT project. The first
6.2-mile segment from DUS to south Westminster is expected to be completed in
2016 and will be the focus area of this study. This segment will serve two stations
including Denver Union Station and Westminster/71st Ave. The remaining segment of
the project, from Westminster north to Longmont, will require additional funding before
construction can begin.
1.3

Relevant Studies

The following review highlights the key findings from previous planning studies and
publications relevant to the study area, which include:
• Gold Line Corridor Transit Operations Plan (2009)
• Northwest Rail Corridor Final Environmental Evaluation (2010)
• West Corridor Service Plan (2013)
• Downtown Denver Commuter Survey (2013)
• Arvada Transit Station Framework Plan (2007)
• Westminster Station Transit Oriented Development
• Wheat Ridge Northwest Subarea Plan (2013)
Arvada Transit Station Framework Plan (2007)
The Arvada Transit Station Plan envisions the development of a transit oriented district
surrounding the station of Olde Town Arvada on the G-Line. The plan creates two
distinct downtown mixed-use development districts: Olde Town and New Town. New
Town would include an increased mix of land uses, including medium density housing
and commercial/office space, while the historic character of Olde Town would be
preserved by maintaining the existing scale of development.
Gold Line Corridor Transit Operations Plan (2009)
The Gold Line Corridor Transit Operations Plan contains bus and rail operations plans
related to the environmental benefits, costs, and impacts of the proposed service
alternatives. Existing transit service descriptions and characteristics of the corridor and
corresponding routes are provided. Two alternatives for transit service are presented
within the bus operations plan, including the “No Action” and “Baseline” alternatives.
The “No Action” alternative assumes no new major transit investments with only the
existing plus committed facility and operating improvements assumed. The “Baseline”
alternative contains operating improvements designed to improve transit access,
circulation, and travel time within the study area.

G-Line vehicles will be electric multiple unit (EMU) commuter rail cars with maximum
operating speeds of 70 miles per hour. Travel time simulations resulted in an average
one-way trip time of 19.5 minutes; however, this time is likely to change based on the
final track alignment and implementation.
Ridership estimates were developed for the G-Line based on DRCOG modeling
scenarios that accounted for various transit investments and incorporated the factors
of land use, development, parking, fare structure, and vehicle load standards. Other
inputs included demographic information such as projected population, employment,
and income. The model projected average daily boardings by station for the initial year
of operation in 2016 and for the future year of 2030. The stations of Olde Town
Arvada, Wheat Ridge & Ward, and Clear Creek & Federal are expected to generate the
greatest ridership.

Additionally, mode of access to each station was projected to determine the method
by which rail passengers are expected to arrive at the station. 41st & Fox and Arvada
Ridge stations are the only stations projected to have more the 50% of passengers
accessing the station via automobile, while passengers at all other stations access the
station by walking or taking transit.

Projected 2016 daily boardings for the G-Line are estimated to be approximately
13,000 and are subsequently projected to increase to 16,800 by 2030. Station
ridership is projected to be highest at Clear Creek/Federal, Olde Town Arvada, and
Wheat Ridge/Ward, where average daily boardings are expected to exceed 2,000.
Ridership is expected to grow by an average of approximately 550 boardings per
station between 2016 and 2030.

Northwest Rail Corridor Final Environmental Evaluation (2010)
The Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation contains bus and rail operations
plans related to the environmental benefits, costs, and impacts of the proposed service
alternatives. The bus operations plan summarizes the existing transit service in the
corridor including current routes, service frequencies and facilities, while the rail
operations plan provides a description of the proposed service including of hours of
operation, service frequency, and stations served.
The Northwest Corridor is envisioned to serve a potential of eleven total stations when
fully constructed; however, only seven of these stations have received FasTracks
funding. Of these seven stations, Westminster/71st Avenue is the only station that will
be operational when the line opens for service in 2016 as part of Phase 1 of the
project. Future phases constructed beyond Westminster/71st Avenue would share a
Right-Of-Way (ROW) with freight operations and would therefore require an operating
agreement with BNSF Railway Company. Due to the interaction with freight trains, the
B-Line will be operated with diesel multiple unit (DMU) commuter rail cars that have the
flexibility to operate on a shared ROW.

Projected 2035 daily boardings for the Westminster/71st Avenue station are estimated
to be 795 when all FasTracks funded stations are included in the ridership model. Of
these average daily boardings, 65% are expected to access the station by bus route
identified as either Routes 31 or 72 in the evaluation report. There will be a total of
925 parking spaces at Westminster/71st Avenue station, which is more than any other
FasTracks funded station in the corridor.

Downtown Denver Commuter Survey (2013)
Each year, the Downtown Denver Partnership surveys employees working in
downtown Denver to examine the commuting patterns and trends of downtown
commuters. The survey found that transit and driving alone are the two most
commonly used ways that commuters travel to work.

Survey respondents have an average one-way commute of 14 miles with the majority
working in the Commercial Core neighborhood of downtown. Other findings conclude
that employer-provided transportation benefits, age, office location, and commute
length all play a role in determining commute choice. Note that this survey predates the
opening of the new Denver Union Station.
West Corridor Service Plan (2013)
The West Corridor Service Plan was developed to restructure the bus network prior to
the implementation of the West Rail Line, which provides light rail service from
downtown Denver to the City of Golden. Lessons learned from this report will help
inform the design of the Service Plans for the Gold and Northwest Corridors. Key
findings in this report include the discovery that the majority of the West Corridor
boarding activity occurs within the inner and middle segments of the corridor, with the
outer segment showing a significant decrease in activity. The final bus service plan
recommended alternative service delivery methods in the outer segment and a
reinvestment of resources in the core grid network, where they could benefit a higher
number of riders. Additionally, an out of direction model was run to determine whether
bus routes should be deviated to serve rail stations off the main corridor. This will be
an issue that has to be addressed in preparation for the opening of the Gold and
Northwest Rail project. The chart in the following page relates to routes studied in the
West Corridor.

Wheat Ridge Northwest Subarea Plan (2013)
The purpose of the Northwest Sub-area Plan is to establish a vision that will guide
future development around the G-Line station of Ward Road in the City of Wheat
Ridge. The plan establishes the need for higher density, mixed-use development around
the transit station with a focus on employment-supporting land uses in the area. Wheat
Ridge voters exempted the area from the height and density restrictions in the City
Charter, which creates an opportunity for high density development along the
Interstate 70 corridor.
Westminster Station Transit Oriented Development
The Westminster Station Transit Oriented Development project is envisioned by the
City of Westminster as a vibrant, mixed-use, high intensity development district, which
will include a community park and open space amenities. The district will be anchored
by the station of Westminster/71st Avenue on the B-Line. A policy framework plan is
in development for land use, urban design, and circulation that will support transit
ridership and revitalization around the station is expected to be adopted in late 2014.

Market Assessment

The Denver region is growing rapidly. In order to provide the best possible service, the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) must continually adjust and keep pace with
those changes. The purpose of this market assessment is to examine the underlying
conditions in the communities that will be served by the Gold Line and Northwest Line
corridors and assess the trends as they relate to the demand for transit service and the
types of services that best match the demand.
The following market characteristics are key factors that influence the demand for
transit and are critical elements of a market-based approach to transit planning:
• Population and Employment Density
• Customer Demographics
• Development Patterns
• Street Patterns
• Market Typologies
This information will be used in subsequent phases of the development of the bus
operations performance analysis to inform the design of transit service improvements.
Market Fundamentals for Transit Planning
The aforementioned market fundamentals are key factors that affect the demand for
transit and are critical elements of a market-based approach to transit planning. Transit
success cannot be attributed to one market factor alone; rather, these fundamentals
combine to form a series of push and pull factors that act as incentives or disincentives
for transit use. Together they identify what is necessary for transit to succeed within a
market context and will be used to create a composite picture of where service is most
likely to generate ridership. Use of the market-based indicators serves to inform
decisions about transit service location and supply.
Population and Employment Density
Population and employment density identifies the location and concentration of
residents and jobs within an area. The distribution of people and jobs significantly
influences the effectiveness of transit. A community with a concentrated mix of uses
will allow transit to serve more customers and trip purposes than an area with a more
dispersed pattern of development. In addition, transit agencies should view local
residents and employees as a base of prospective customers. Higher densities are
positive market indicators for transit, assuming that the preference for riding transit is
consistent across a service area; routes in low-density areas will be limited in their
ability to generate a substantial level of ridership given the smaller base of customers
from which to draw.
Customer Demographics
In practice, customer preferences are not static across a service area. Preferences vary
from community to community based on local mobility needs. Demographic data such
as income or personal vehicle access provides additional information about the
population that can be used to further identify where the strongest market
opportunities for transit exist. In a market-based approach, understanding different

Attachment: Proposed Gold & Northwest Cooridors Service Plan (2478 : Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan)

1.C.3.a

Packet Pg. 128

rider market segments will help transit agencies better match transit service products
to serve a particular customer market segment. In addition, a market analysis of
customer characteristics supports RTD’s responsibility to comply with Title VI federal
regulations which aim to identify and mitigate disproportionate and disparate service
impacts to low-income and minority households respectively.
Development Patterns
In evaluating the market for transit, agencies must consider how the configuration of a
community will influence service design. Higher density developments with varied land
uses are typically indicators of more sustainable developments where active modes of
travel (i.e., walking and biking) together with transit, become viable alternatives in
completing for all types of trips. Transit-oriented developments promote multimodal
travel and maximize access to public transportation through features such as enhanced
pedestrian and bicycle facilities, as well as pedestrian-scaled street design. The
multimodal amenities, mix of land uses, and closer proximity of activity centers entices
residents and visitors to complete more of their trips via transit, foregoing the use of
private vehicles.
Street Patterns
The shape and design of the street network profoundly impacts transit opportunity and
success. It is important to remember that the majority of transit trips begin and end as
pedestrian trips, making strong pedestrian connections vital for transit success. Areas
that prioritize pedestrian access are characterized by multiple points of entry, functional
sidewalks, good lighting, a grid-like street pattern, short blocks, and direct alignments
between destinations. Street design factors such as street width and alignment
influence pedestrian and vehicle access, travel time, and safety. Areas with
discontinuous and non-linear streets present barriers to pedestrian circulation and
provide a disincentive to use transit.
Market Typologies
Market typologies serve as generalized characterizations of the varying market
conditions within the region. Each typology incorporates findings from population and
employment densities as well as development and land use patterns. Each market
typology presents different opportunities and challenges for transit and serves as a
guide to inform transit service decisions. Utilizing typologies ultimately offers an
efficient method for categorizing community mobility needs and identifying the best-fit
solutions.
2.2

Existing Market Conditions

The following market assessment presents an overview of the population
demographics and characteristics of each corridor and was used to identify areas that
are more prone to transit use. Demographic characteristics incorporated into this
assessment include income, race, car ownership, and senior populations. Additionally,
the population and employment densities within the corridors were used to determine
the location of high density trip generators and potential ridership patterns.
Population and Employment Density

1.C.3.a

Packet Pg. 129

Generally, higher population and employment densities are more conducive to transit
usage. In the Gold and Northwest Corridor service areas, high population densities are
found in the neighborhoods immediately surrounding downtown Denver, Westminster
and the area between Olde Town Arvada and Arvada Ridge. Areas located immediately
north of the West Line show particularly strong population densities, which can be
attributed to their proximity to Colfax Avenue, a major arterial road with strong retail
and residential developments that have resulted in higher densities. Heading north from
the West Line and away from the City of Denver, population densities begin to
diminish. The City of Wheat Ridge is a low density community with a small
concentration of higher density development located just south of Interstate 70.
Between Interstate 70 and the G-Line, population densities are reduced as the land use
transitions to commercial and industrial developments with fewer residential areas. The
City of Arvada, which possesses two stations on the G-Line, exhibits higher densities
in areas along the G-Line between Wadsworth Blvd. and Kipling Street. Population
densities begin to diminish upon heading north away from Olde Town Arvada until
reaching the City of Westminster. Westminster maintains two medium density
corridors along 88th Avenue and 92nd Avenue that lead east to US 36 and the planned
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. East of US 36, population densities substantially
increase in the City of Thornton, especially between 84th Ave and 104th Ave to the
west of Interstate 25. This area exhibits some of the highest densities outside of
downtown Denver.
Similar to population densities, employment densities in the Gold and Northwest
Corridors are highest in downtown Denver and the immediate surrounding areas.
Outside of downtown, employment densities are highest along the arterial roadways
including the east-west roads of 44th Ave., 84th Ave., 88th Ave., and the north-south
roads of Federal Blvd., Sheridan Blvd., and Wadsworth Blvd.
• 44th Avenue is characterized by various strip retail centers located along the
western portion of the study area, as well as a Walmart that sits adjacent to the
Lakeside Amusement Park. Development along this corridor often changes from
residential to retail with a distribution of retail centers scattered throughout the
residential areas.
•

84th Avenue is characterized by higher density residential development, including
some three story apartment buildings, and several employment centers, which
include St. Anthony North Hospital and the North Valley Tech Center. The
concentration of apartments would be expected to generate above average
ridership on routes serving this segment.

•

88th Avenue contains several large employment centers including the seasonal
Waterworld Water Park, North Suburban Medical Center, and numerous big box
retail stores. In addition, there is a connection with the US 36/Sheridan BRT Station
and the Thornton Park-n-Ride, with each providing several transit connections to
the greater RTD network. The mix of residential and retail development should
make this corridor a strong market for transit.

•

Federal Boulevard is characterized by varied land uses with portions of residential,
strip retail, commercial and industrial developments along the corridor. Residential

Attachment: Proposed Gold & Northwest Cooridors Service Plan (2478 : Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan)

1.C.3.a

development remains the most dominant form of land use with limited commercial
and strip retail developments spread out through the corridor. Major attractions
along this corridor include the Denver Bronco’s stadium, which generates strong
seasonal ridership.
•

Sheridan Boulevard is similar to Federal Blvd. with a mixture of varied land uses but
its employment densities are also supplemented by big box retail locations and a
greater intensity of industrial development.

•

Wadsworth Boulevard is characterized by dense, mixed-use development with retail
nodes located at major intersections. Big box retail stores contribute significantly to
the employment density in this corridor and anchor other retail stores nearby.
Additionally, Wadsworth Blvd. passes through Olde Town Arvada, which is
comprised of retail developments in the historic district. See Map 3 for population
and employment densities.

Customer Demographics
Income
In order to comply with the Federal Department of Transportation’s Title VI regulations
under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) under
C4702.1B requires transit service providers to conduct a service equity analysis with
minority and low income populations when a major service change has been proposed.
As established by RTD, this analysis includes provisions that an adverse impact, as a
result of the proposed changes, may not be borne by low-income persons by more than
10% above non-low income populations. Care must be taken to ensure that the
proposed recommendations do not result in a disproportionate burden on low income
populations.
Low-income persons are defined by the US Census as persons living in households
with a total family income of less than or equal to its poverty threshold. This threshold
is calculated based on the size of the family and how many children under the age of
18 live in the household. These families are more likely to use transit of necessity,
being less able to afford other forms of transport with some or all of the household
using transit as their primary mobility mode.
Downtown Denver has the greatest concentration of low-income persons in the study
area. Outside of downtown, there is a significant low-income population adjacent to
the G-Line station of 41st & Fox, as well as north of the Westminster/71st Ave station
on the B-Line. Excluding these areas, there is not a significant concentration of lowincome persons in either corridor. See Map 4: Population in Poverty.
Minorities
Similar to the low-income population, Title VI recognizes areas with a high
concentration of minority populations, as care must be taken to ensure that an adverse
impact, as a result of a major change, is not disproportionally borne by minority

Attachment: Proposed Gold & Northwest Cooridors Service Plan (2478 : Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan)

1.C.3.a

Packet Pg. 131

communities. The proposed recommendations should not result in an impact greater
than 10% above majority populations.
Downtown Denver and the surrounding areas possess the greatest concentration of
minority persons in the study area. In the Gold Corridor, the minority population is
lower with the greatest population near the stations of 41st & Fox and 60th & Sheridan.
Alternatively, the Northwest Corridor possesses a considerably larger minority
population, particularly in the area between US 36 and Interstate 25, which falls within
the market capture of the service. It is important that these communities are
recognized and taken into account when developing major changes in the transit
network. See Map 5: Minority Populations.
Vehicle Access
Persons with limited access to a vehicle for work-based or personal trips are more
likely to account for a higher share of transit use. Typically, an area has a vehicle
access deficient population if there are two or more persons (of driving age) per vehicle
or four or more households per acre without access to a car. Neighborhoods with
deficient automobile access generally lie within areas of concentrated low income,
senior, or college-aged populations, where car ownership is either unnecessary or
results in financial burden.
Similar to the other demographic findings, reduced vehicle availability is concentrated
in downtown Denver and adjacent to the station of 41st & Fox. The remaining study
area population does not have a high concentration of persons with limited access to a
vehicle suggesting that the majority of the population will have a competitive means
other than transit to complete their trips. See Map 6: Zero Vehicle Households.
Senior Population
When older adults lose their ability to drive, they also risk losing their connections with
their community and to vital services and activities. The senior population, defined as
persons age 65 and older, is generally more dependent on transit for shopping,
medical, and other personal trips when compared with other age groups. The study
area does not contain any notable concentration of seniors which will need special
mobility consideration. See Map 7: Senior Citizens.

Development Patterns
Single-family residential housing is the dominant land use in the study area. While often
associated with urban sprawl and automobile centered development, single family
residential land uses can vary from low to medium densities depending on the street
pattern. A more compact street network often contributes to higher densities of
housing, which are more supportive of transit use. Some multi-family residential
housing exists in the study area but is typically centered around downtown Denver
where higher density condominiums, apartments, and townhomes are more prevalent.
Outside of downtown, multi-family residential land uses are scattered throughout the
study area and often located along major roadways. Commercial and industrial land
uses are concentrated along the existing rail lines, particularly in the area immediately
north of downtown Denver. Retail development is typically confined to shopping
centers located throughout the study area at major intersections. No single retail
location is significantly more influential than the others. However, the presence of large
value oriented retailers will make some locations better candidates for supporting
transit use.
Street Patterns
The Denver region was established with a grid street plan characterized by intersecting
perpendicular roadways oriented to the four cardinal directions, excepting downtown.
Major roadways intersect every one-half mile which is more or less a ten minute walk.
Closer to downtown Denver, the street network is more compact, with block distances
less than 300 feet, allowing for higher densities of residential development. A strong
grid network is maintained heading west until Wadsworth Blvd. After Wadsworth
Blvd., non-linear streets become more prevalent with greater distances between
blocks. The non-linear and cul-de-sac street types found in this area are the result of
subdivision developments and are naturally prohibitive to transit use due to their
minimal access and lack of focus on the pedestrian environment. Even greater barriers
to transit exist continuing northwest to the outskirts of Standley Lake where the
presence of parks, lakes, golf courses, and subdivisions have further disrupted the
street pattern.
Market Typologies
Market typologies in this study area include urban core, core, suburban, and industrial.
The urban core market constitutes downtown Denver and surrounding areas heading
west to Wadsworth Blvd. and north to Interstate 70. As shown in the
population/employment density and the demographic maps, the higher densities of the
urban core and close proximity to key destinations make transit more effective in this
area.
North of Interstate 70, the study area transitions into a core market with medium
densities and several Park-n-Rides, which signify more auto-centric developments. The
core market lends itself to peak oriented commuters traveling further distances to
employment centers. The ability to attract ridership depends upon the ability to
compete with automobile travel times.
The suburban market is defined as the area west of Ward Rd. where development is
characterized by non-linear street patterns, minimal pedestrian facilities, and low
density single family housing. Suburban markets tend to have high concentrations of

Attachment: Proposed Gold & Northwest Cooridors Service Plan (2478 : Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan)

1.C.3.a

25
Packet Pg. 138

car ownership and a limited market for transit as travel distances are greater to and
from the population and employment centers making transit less competitive compared
with the automobile.
An industrial market currently surrounds portions of the G-Line alignment from
downtown Denver to Arvada with various facilities occupying large areas of land
limiting the diversity of land uses. The industrial market often requires transit service
during non-traditional hours with demand to these areas depending on parking
availability and transit access. Limited residential development and retail opportunities
are likely to affect potential immediate ridership gains in this area.

Service Evaluation
An assessment of the existing transit service is essential for understanding a route’s
role within the larger transit network and for analyzing individual route performance
against the service standard metrics. Included in this assessment is a ridership review
that helped to identify boarding activity and ridership trends.
3.1

Service Fundamentals for Transit Design

Service fundamentals provide a framework for evaluating transit performance and
identifying opportunities for improvement. Service fundamentals are divided into two
categories: Service Design Decisions and Performance Metrics. Performance metrics
show how a route performs while service design decisions provide explanations for
why a route performs the way it does. When analyzing market demand for transit and
service performance no one metric or design decision provides a complete story of a
route’s performance; but when considered as a whole, a clear picture of existing
performance is generated.
Service Design Decisions
Transit agencies can make a number of important service design decisions that
positively influence a customer’s decision to ride transit. This section details the impact
that decisions such as service frequency, span, speed, reliability, approachability, route
alignment, and network role have on ridership levels.
• Service Frequency – Frequency is one of the most effective service design
characteristics that influence transit trial and ongoing use. Routes with
spontaneous-use frequencies (service every 15 minutes or better) benefit
passengers by reducing their out-of-vehicle wait times. At these service levels,
passengers typically do not need to consult schedules nor time their arrival at bus
stops. Higher bus frequencies also provide a better connection to more frequent rail
services which maximizes network benefits by facilitating the transfer experience.
• Service Span – Service span is the hours and days of operation of a route. It
affects ridership by limiting when passengers can travel and often affects both ends
of a trip even though half of the trip occurs during regular service hours. Greater
service span provides more travel flexibility and improves the customer experience,
but excessive time span coverage like geographic coverage can be excessively
unproductive.
• Service Speed – Faster operating speeds benefit both the customer and the transit
agency by reducing in-vehicle travel times for passengers and resource

requirements for the agency. Out-of-direction travel (deviations), excessive stop
dwell time (stops too closely spaced or long delays at stops), unsynchronized travel
signal delay, and traffic congestion will be identified for possible mitigation.
Reliability – On time performance impacts a passenger’s ability to rely on a service
to get them to their destination in a timely and consistent manner. Service reliability
(daily delivery of service as scheduled) is the most important metric in retaining
existing transit customers.
Alignment – The alignment refers to the operating path of the transit route.
Alignment design should balance customer access (walk distances) with service
directness (fast travel). Direct service normally results in higher ridership (deviations
deter upstream customer use) and lower operating costs (shorter round trip travel
times often require fewer resources). One typical impact of introducing bus
connections to rail stations occurs when the bus must leave the natural direct
alignment to reach the station. The number of patrons riding through the station on
the bus versus the potential ridership at the station must both be considered and
are influenced by the length of the deviation (impact on through riders per new
station rider) 1.
Round Trip Cycle Time – The cycle time’s relationship to the frequency is the
principal factor in service design efficiency. For instance, a round trip cycle time of
56 minutes 2 can be easily rounded to 60 minutes, which efficiently divides into 60,
30, 20, 15, 12, and 10 minute frequencies. One of 65 minutes presents major
efficiency issues, where operation of any of the preceding frequencies would
require the inefficient use of one extra bus. Consequently, the route alignment and
operating speed should be both considered in assuring that routes have efficient
round trip cycle times whenever possible.
Route Spacing – Routes should be spaced to maximize effective network access.
Services placed too close together or too far apart become issues in network cost
effectiveness (unproductive competition) and synergy. Typical spacing is no closer
than ½ mile and no farther apart than one mile where the necessary densities are
present. These distances are heavily influenced by the street network and the mode
and service level (consumer research has found that customers will walk further to
better service). 3
Network Role – While the design of individual routes is important, how they come
together into an efficient and effective network is critical to attracting transit use
for a variety of trip-making purposes by a broad cross-section of the community
(transit lifestyle design: “live-work-play” mobility).
Approachability – The approachability of a system refers to how easy it is for a
passenger to navigate and understand a system. Systems that are approachable

1

The industry best practice out-of-direction model measures the minutes of out-of-direction
travel for the deviation times the number of through-riders divided by the number of new station
riders. A ratio of 2 to 5 minutes is the acceptable range of impacts with 2 minutes a good
trade-off and 5 minutes as the highest acceptable impact.
2
The round trip cycle time is also known as revenue time and includes the in-service running
time plus terminal recovery time to ensure the on-time departure of the next trip.
3
Typical consumer walk distances are ¼ mile for regular bus transit (80% of the riders travel ¼
mile or less – 5 minute walks), while the 80% consumer walk shed for rail and enhanced bus is
½ mile (10-minute walk).

make customers comfortable with using public transit and reduce uncertainty.
Excess complexity can negatively affect both route and more importantly network
attractiveness. This is a qualitative assessment that considers issues such as line
branching, short/long lines, trippers, deviations, corridor alignments, and service
frequencies.
Performance Metrics
Performance indicators provide a way of quantifying the strength of a route’s
performance and comparing it with others in the system. The magnitude of a
performance indicator is directly related to the number of passengers who ride a given
route or service unit. Performance indicators are an important route evaluation tool
because they allow routes that vary greatly in boardings, service levels, and costs to
be compared directly to one another and are part of RTD’s Service Standards program.
The performance metric inputs are defined as:
•
•
•
•

•

4

Boardings – Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
Revenue Hours – In‐service plus recovery time, but not including non-revenue time
(deadheading movements and pull-time to/from service garage).
Operating Revenues – Cash, ticket, electronic fare media, and tokens allocated by
route by farebox recorded boardings plus other revenue directly attributable to
service operation (e.g., vehicle and shelter advertising).
Operating Cost – All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing
current service. RTD’s cost allocation model allocates costs to each route based on
its miles, hours, and peak vehicles and varies between in-house and contracted
operations. Individual accounting line items are assigned to the most relevant
service unit variable by the model.
Subsidy – Operating revenue minus operating cost minus fare revenues.

Existing Service Conditions
4.1

Transit Route Network

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route
alignment, and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived
from the performance of all routes within each class. RTD conducts an annual route
review using the performance indicators of subsidy per boarding and boardings per
hour.
Routes in the Gold and Northwest corridors fall into one of the following service class
categories: Central Business District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, or
Express. The majority of routes in the study area provide local service, characterized by
frequent stops to allow convenient access to destinations along major and minor
streets. Local service routes are categorized as CBD Local, Urban Local, or Suburban
Local. CBD local routes operate to and from downtown Denver. Urban Local routes
predominantly serve urban areas which have higher residential and/or employment
densities. Suburban Local routes predominantly serve suburban areas which have low
to medium residential densities, offering transit coverage to less developed
communities in the far reaches of the service area. Limited routes supplement local
routes during peak periods of travel demand or throughout the day but are not

operating within the study area at this time. Express routes provide commute-oriented
service primarily during peak periods between major origins and destinations in the
region. Express routes make fewer stops, can operate on highways, and provide faster
service to destinations compared with local or limited routes. Express routes represent
a premium service with fares that are generally higher than local or limited routes.

Transit Service Levels
Transit service levels include frequency and span. Frequency refers to how often a
route runs and span refers to the hours and days of operation. Transit service levels are
often dictated by a number of factors, the most important being actual usage, i.e.
market demand. Increased demand for transit often translates into an increased supply
of service with better frequencies, longer spans, and multiple days of operation.
Similarly, less demand usually translates into less service. Other contributing factors
that influence transit service levels include connections to key destinations, historical
precedent, regional significance, and operating agreements.
Frequency
In the RTD route network, frequency is broken down into three categories:
spontaneous-use (15 minutes or less), coordinated (30 minutes), and lifeline (60
minutes or more).
• Spontaneous-use frequencies minimize passenger wait times and eliminate the need
for passengers to plan their trips in advance around the schedule which ultimately
attracts more riders making routes more cost-effective. CBD Local and Urban Local
routes often possess frequencies that facilitate spontaneous use.
• Coordinated frequencies require passengers to coordinate their trips in advance to
arrive and depart in a fashion that will minimize wait times and reduce their overall
travel time. Coordinated frequencies are often found on routes that cannot support
spontaneous-use frequencies but have enough demand to support greater service
levels than the lifeline frequencies.

•

Lifeline frequencies provide transit coverage to areas that cannot support higher
frequencies. These services are often used to expand the transit service area to
provide access to outlying communities. Focusing efforts on lifeline coverage does
not typically grow ridership but can provide critical mobility for many passengers
located in low density markets. Suburban Local routes often have lifeline
frequencies. Routes that provide “trips” rather than a regular frequency are often
the result of commute oriented travel patterns where transit demand is not
sufficient enough to warrant midday service or regular service frequencies.

Gold Corridor
In the Gold Corridor, spontaneous use frequencies are found south of Interstate 70 on
three east-west CBD Local routes. These are Routes 32, 38 and 44 which serve the
City of Wheat Ridge and downtown Denver. Other spontaneous use frequencies are
found on the two major north-south arterial roadways of Federal Blvd. and Wadsworth
Blvd. All other routes in the Gold Corridor possess coordinated frequencies and are
concentrated in the areas north of Interstate 70 and on the remaining north-south
arterial roadways.

Northwest Corridor
In the Northwest Corridor, routes generally provide either coordinated or lifeline
frequency services as a result of operating at a greater distance from the urban core
where population and employment densities are lower and ridership demand is less.

Span
Span of service in the RTD network often varies by service class and is based on
service policy and ridership demand. A wider service span gives passengers greater
flexibility when planning their trips and encourages ridership at different hours of the
day to meet varying passenger needs, but conversely increases cost.

Attachment: Proposed Gold & Northwest Cooridors Service Plan (2478 : Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan)

Route 86X provides a spontaneous use 10-minute frequency but only operates during
the peak hours, while other Express routes provide service on a per trip basis.

CBD Local and Urban Local routes typically begin weekday service between 4:00
AM to 5:00 AM. The end of service, however, varies greatly with some routes
ending service around 8:00 PM and others ending service at 2:00 AM the next day.
Suburban Local routes typically begin weekday service between 5:00 AM and 6:00
AM with service ending between 7:00 PM and 11:00 PM.
Express routes provide peak-only service typically between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM
and again at 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM to meet the demand of commuters traveling to
and from large employment centers.

The Gold Line Corridor is served primarily by CBD and Urban Local routes with greater
frequencies and spans. The corridor is intersected with Routes 31, 51, 76, and 100
which travel north-south and provide service along the major arterial roads of Federal
Boulevard, Sheridan Boulevard, Wadsworth Boulevard, and Kipling Street. None of
these routes serve downtown Denver but they do connect with the West Rail Line
further south of the G-Line. The Gold Line corridor is also served by two Express
routes, 55X and 72X, operating on Interstate 70, which do provide service to
downtown Denver from the Olde Town Arvada and Ward Road Park-n-Ride facilities.
These routes have 15 to 30 minute frequencies during the peak periods and 30 to 60
minute frequencies in the off-peak periods. They serve primarily as commute supply for
workers travelling to downtown Denver.
The Northwest Corridor is served predominately by Suburban Local routes and Express
routes. Express routes operating on US Highway 36 and Interstate 25 provide peakonly service to and from downtown Denver. Suburban Local routes in this corridor
typically operate at frequencies of 30 or 60 minutes throughout the day. This corridor
is also served by Urban Local Route 31 which travels on Federal Blvd. and serves the
US 36/Sheridan BRT Station.
Performance
Route performance is essential in developing appropriate service plan recommendations
as resources need to be invested to optimize performance and maximize ridership.
Performance is measured in productivity; how efficient the service is provided in
regards to expenditure and how effective the service is at accomplishing its intended
objectives. Productivity increases as market demand begins to match the current
supply of service and productivity decreases when the supply of service exceeds the
market demand. Although the market for transit cannot be controlled 4, poor market
conditions can be mitigated through service and network design choices. Matching
transit service levels, including frequency and span, with the transit market demand is
one way to strengthen service productivity.
RTD Service Class Service Standards

RTD through collaboration with its member cities and counties can support changes that
influence mobility choice. For instance, current RTD support of sustainable community Smart
Growth initiatives that foster transit oriented development develop “transit lifestyle” markets
where transit, biking, and walking play stronger roles in public mobility.

Subsidy per Boarding
RTD conducts an annual route review using performance indicators such as subsidy per
boarding. The subsidy per boarding measurement determines the portion of the
operating cost, after subtracting fare revenues, that RTD pays on a per passenger
boarding basis. Routes with a higher subsidy per boarding cost more to operate and
therefore, perform worse than routes with a lower subsidy per boarding. Potential
methods to improve subsidy per boarding include lowering operating costs by reducing
route frequency and span. This will decrease the number of buses, drivers, pay hours,
and service miles required to operate a route but can also reduce ridership. Another
method to improve subsidy per boarding is to increase ridership and revenue through
route realignment, route consolidation, or route deviation. Additional ridership and
revenue can also be generated by marketing the service, improving operating
characteristics such as on-time-performance, safety, reliability, and route network
integration with other transit services. Improvements in scheduling can often result in
reduced operating costs, improved service efficiency and reliability.

Boardings per Hour
RTD also uses the boardings per revenue hour metric to measure route performance.
The boardings per revenue hour calculation measures the average number of passenger
boardings per hour of revenue service. Routes that generate higher boardings per hour
represent more productive routes where market demand (boardings) is balanced with
the supply of service (revenue hours). If demand increases, but supply remains the
same, then productivity will increase. If supply increases, but demand remains the
same, then productivity will decrease. By balancing the supply of service with the
market demand, transit providers can generate the greatest return on their investment
by reducing operating costs and associated subsidies – RTD has service standards
policies that address both high and low performing routes. Following is service
productivity for bus routes within the Gold Line and Northwest Line corridors.

Within the Gold Line Corridor, CBD Local bus routes have below average boardings per
revenue hour of service. The CBD Local transit routes average 42 boardings per hour in
the entire RTD Service Area, while CBD Local buses average only 31 boardings per
hour in the Gold Line Corridor. Route 32 is the worst performing CBD Local line in the
study area with just 23 boardings per revenue hour. Route 32 travels south of the Gold
Rail Line primarily in low density residential neighborhoods. The Express services within
the Gold Corridor also underperform compared to the RTD average. While the 55X
Express line performs well with 55 boardings per hour, the 72X Express Line only has
33 boardings per hour. The RTD system wide average for an Express line is 54
boardings per hour. The variance between the two lines may have to do with the fact
that the 55X line is mostly express and has a short spur into Olde Towne Arvada as a
local route whereas the 72X line has a longer spur into residential and commercial
neighborhoods Arvada which would decrease route productivity. The Urban Local and
Suburban Local routes in the Gold Line Corridor are more in line with the averages for
overall service area.

Within the Northwest Corridor, the Express lines and Suburban Local lines have about
average productivity for their service type in the region while the Urban Local Route 31
performs above the RTD average for Urban Local services. There is significant variation
between the Express lines in the corridor however. For example, the 86X Express line
which travels from Sheridan/US-36 in Westminster to DUS has an average of 85
boardings per revenue hour which is much higher than the system-wide average of 54
boardings per revenue hour for Express services. This is likely due to the 86X Express
line having very little locally running service (park-n-rider access) while the 31X, 40X,
and 80X all have significant local walk-up access which would bring down their
averages. 6
Farebox Recovery
Farebox recovery is the ratio of fare revenue to operating costs. It indicates the
percentage of operating costs covered by passenger boarding revenue. The higher the
farebox recovery, the lower the subsidy a route requires to operate, leaving more
funding available to operate more service. Routes with a high farebox recovery ratio
have the greatest share of the operating cost paid by passengers. Express routes
represent the most productive service class in terms of farebox recovery in this
category due to the strong ridership, higher fare of $4.00 instead of the local fare of
$2.25, and focused operating costs as a result of providing peak-only service. Farebox
recovery for the entire RTD system was 23.8% in 2012.

6

RTD conducted a test over a decade ago regarding whether park-n-ride or community walk-up
access would provide better mobility and attract more riders, more productively. The test
conclusively found that park-n-ride express service performed significantly better than the local
running alternative and could deliver more service for the same operating cost.

Productivity Analysis
CBD Local and Express routes generate the best performance statistics due to the
number of people carried on these services. The performance of Urban Local routes is
next, while Suburban Local routes generate the weakest performance of all the route
types. Identifying which routes are the most costly to run can help result in a more
efficient allocation of resources. Routes with strong financial effectiveness are
candidates for additional investment, while routes with weak financial effectiveness
may be candidates for service reduction or realignment.
RTD service standards state “the least productive 10% of routes based on either
subsidy per boarding or boardings per revenue hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision, or elimination.” These are noted below in Red.

Gold Corridor Route Performance
The Gold Corridor is primarily served by CBD Local and Urban Local routes, which are
typically more productive due to their high frequencies and strong ridership. In the
corridor, Routes 6, 31, 38, 76, 51, 52, and 55X each have a subsidy per boarding of
less than $4.00. The system wide subsidy per boarding is $3.31 for Year 2012.
Routes 32, 100, and 72X require a subsidy greater than the group average. Routes 32
and 100 exceed $6.00 subsidy per boarding and will require further analysis. All routes
generate more than 15 boardings per hour.
Of all the routes in the Gold Corridor, only Route 32 fails the subsidy per boarding 10%
service class standard. Route 32 currently operates on a 15 minute peak frequency and
a 30-minute off-peak frequency and serves downtown Denver and the VA Medical
Center located east of downtown. This medical center is expected to be replaced by a
new VA Hospital in Aurora in May 2015. When this happens, this route’s performance
is expected to decline further requiring additional marketing, revision, or elimination.
Northwest Corridor Route Performance
The Northwest Corridor is served mainly by Suburban and Express routes, which often
require a greater subsidy to operate. Five routes exceed the $6.00 subsidy per
boarding figure compared to two in the Gold Corridor. The higher subsidies are a result
of the less productive suburban market ridership as compared with Urban Local routes.
All Suburban routes in this corridor exceed 10 boardings per hour with the exception of
Route 104, and all Express routes exceed 20 boardings per hour.

Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan
Building upon RTD’s significant investments in transit, the addition of rail service in the
Gold and Northwest corridors is another major step forward in developing a
comprehensive and seamless transit network for the people of the greater Denver area.
However, rail service is only part of the overall transit improvements envisioned for
these corridors. The bus network which carries the vast majority of transit riders was
evaluated and recommendations were made to complement the additional rail service
with direct and convenient access to the new rail stations. Recommendations were
also made to the bus network to enhance intra-corridor mobility and to strengthen
connectivity to urban and suburban regional destinations while improving operational
efficiency and the rider’s experience.
Plan Framework and Strategies
To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of limited
operating resources, it was imperative that the recommendations were congruent with
RTD’s vision for a regionally integrated transit network that will improve mobility,
enhance economic competitiveness, reduce congestion and pollution, and will
ultimately retain existing riders while continuing to attract new ones. The service
recommendations not only focus on enhancing operating efficiency and improving
transit network effectiveness, but also aim to make transit the region’s mode of
choice.
The Existing Conditions findings from the ridership analysis, service performance, and
market conditions also informed the development of guiding principles which served as
the framework for the service plan. The framework and strategies guided the
development of the plan recommendations from both a “top-down” network-level
perspective as well as a route-level “bottom-up” perspective.
Network Design Strategies
Transit system success is built over a network, not by individual bus route or rail line.
The critical goal for the Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan is to build a simple,
easy-to-use network that is comprised of a family of bus and rail service tiers, all
focusing on delivering the overall network experience desired by existing and potential
customers.
Leverage Rail Investment
RTD has made a significant investment in new rail alignments to improve regional
mobility. These investments will help shape land use patterns, enhance the competitive
advantage of the region, reduce congestion and pollution, and improve the livability and
vibrancy of the area. However, new rail infrastructure alone can’t accomplish these
goals. Investments in rail infrastructure must be leveraged and seamlessly integrated
into RTD’s larger network of transit services. By serving as the transit corridor
backbones, rail service offers several advantages over other modes of travel to include
larger carrying capacities, and faster and more reliable service. To leverage these
advantages, many of the adjacent or intersecting bus routes were realigned to serve
the new rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service were reallocated, and bus
route alignment changes were made to refocus network coverage. Through these

Strengthen Bus Service Tiers
RTD has a number of bus tiers which are defined by their target markets and service
characteristics. The Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan further differentiates the
network and corridor target markets between “transit lifestyle” and “coverage”
markets. Service designed for sustainable lifestyle consumers focuses on spontaneoususe frequencies of 10-15 minutes throughout the day and week that allow consumers
to walk-up and catch the next trip without planning their arrival at the stop. These
spontaneous use corridors will form the top tier of arterial bus transit and are good
candidates for future infrastructure investment to enhance the wait (upgraded stops)
and travel experience (reduced delay; improved reliability) for customers.
Lifestyle areas require development densities high enough to sustain these service
levels productively (meeting RTD standards) together with community orientation that
facilitates transit, walking, and biking active mobility. Coverage transit markets are
those where densities and community design are focused on automobile travel, which
makes significant transit mode penetration not possible and/or cost-effective. The
proposed plan focuses increased service frequency investment to network areas and
corridors that support lifestyle transit while tailoring transit options for coverage service
areas.
Route Spacing and Prioritization
Where multiple routes operate along shared or parallel corridors, route consolidation or
prioritizing was evaluated in order to create a more robust transit service with greater
frequency that adds value to riders and supports spontaneous network use. Routes
operating along the same or adjacent corridors usually compete for the same riders,
reducing the effectiveness and increasing the net cost of service of each route. By
consolidating or prioritizing routes, limited resources can be reinvested within the
transit network to provide more direct, faster, and reliable service. For example,
instead of operating three 20 minute service routes in parallel, the plan looks to operate
one at 10 or 15 minutes with the other two at 30 or 60 minutes. 7 In many instances,
the middle route operates on a major arterial and can be a candidate for infrastructure
enhancement to reduce delay and improve the customer experience - this investment
has more ridership and performance return on streamlined corridors with higher service
levels.
Alternative First/Last Mile Transit
In most cases, network transit mobility is best served using regular fixed route bus
service. In some cases where the mobility needs are more limited (e.g., work or school
commuting; senior mobility) or where development intensity is too low to productively
support regular fixed route bus service, alternative mobility options are appropriate.
The Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan considered more cost-effective
7

Research in many cities has documented that corridor prioritizing generates more overall
ridership for the same resource cost because more consumers are attracted. They walk further
to better bus transit with the average access for basic local bus at ¼ mile (80% of riders) while
for enhanced frequent bus this walk shed increases to ½ mile attracting more riders.

actions, an integrated transit network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce
operating costs, and strengthen regional and community mobility.

43
Packet Pg. 156

alternatives in such instances including Call-n-Rides, station-based vanpools or carsharing, home-to-work vanpools, or private shuttles. Existing express services should
be reconfigured as first-mile connectors to the nearest rail station where current
ridership is low or where the rail connection offers improved service frequency and/or
travel time. RTD should consider remote PnRs rather than walk-up access to improve
performance of these first-mile replacement services.
Route Design Strategies
To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of its operating
resources, it is important to ensure that not only is there a coherent vision for a
complete transit network, but that individual routes can attract ridership as well. The
following route design strategies focus not only maintaining high operating efficiency,
but providing an improved customer experience that will attract more riders and
operating revenue, thus improving effectiveness as well.
Route Streamlining
Deviating routes from the main transit corridors reduces the walking distance and
makes transit more attractive to small numbers of riders but makes it significantly less
attractive to large numbers of riders using the main corridor. The result is fewer total
riders at higher operating cost. 8 The Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan calls for
limiting deviations to just areas that can justify the additional travel time and costs by
high ridership on the deviation – areas such as rail stations, transit hubs, and major
destinations in order make individual routes, as well as the transit network, more
productive and attractive to riders. In cases where the deviation was providing needed
lifeline coverage, alternative service was proposed while also proposing streamlined
corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their
alignments. Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate
more ridership than areas with lower densities. For example, Route 76 serves the
Wadsworth Boulevard corridor where ridership is much stronger between the Olde
Town Arvada and Lakewood City Commons. Cost-effective short-lining has been
proposed in such instances using either an interior short-list (long-line running the full
length with the short-line between Olde Town and Lakewood) or a pattern overlap
(north terminal to Lakewood and south terminal to Olde Town) depending on the offpeak ridership pattern and customer through-riding.
Stop Consolidation
One of the greatest sources of operating delay and on-time performance impacts is
dwell time at bus stops. While closely-spaced bus stops increase the ease in which
riders can access the transit system that convenience comes at the expense of
operating speed and service reliability. Closely spaced stops not only impact route
8

RTD’s out-of-direction standard calls for deviations to have less than 3 minutes increased
travel time impact to through-passengers for each rider served on the deviation to avoid total
route ridership loss. Also, deviations typically cost more to operate due to increased mileage
and slower off-route operating speeds.

Attachment: Proposed Gold & Northwest Cooridors Service Plan (2478 : Proposed Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan)

1.C.3.a

Packet Pg. 157

performance, increase stop maintenance costs, and accelerate bus maintenance costs,
but they can significantly reduce the competitiveness of the service. By finding an
optimal balance of stop spacing to maintain convenient access to transit service while
reducing potential for delay, the efficiency and effectiveness of transit can be
increased significantly. While stop consolidation is not proposed per se as part of the
Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan, it is recommended that RTD continue is stop
consolidation program throughout the bus network.
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it
is more intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the
corridor continuously. If general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of
through travel relative to local mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and
destinations together were consolidated to increase rider convenience by eliminating or
reducing transfers required to complete their trip along a natural transit corridor. In
some cases this results in restructuring the corridor into routes with consistent roles:
one is streamlined to serve the main arterial with frequent service while one or more
are designed to serve the neighborhood interior with less direct service where walk
access to the main corridor is not feasible.
Route Segmentation
In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high
proportion of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those
routes into two distinct routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or
scheduling efficiency were evaluated. This was primarily due to the low number of
riders remaining on the bus and traveling through the point in question. These actions
also resulted in routes with more balanced service levels on either side of this midpoint
based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance
appeared to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route
service were considered. These alternative mobility options included Call-n-Rides,
special shuttles (destination), service routes (tailored for specific trip-making, e.g.,
seniors), or commute oriented programs (e.g., station vans, car/bike sharing). These
options maintain service coverage mobility while reducing RTD’s net subsidy.

With commuter rail serving as the structural spine of the Gold Line and Northwest Rail
corridors, connecting north-south routes will provide the underlying support network
for the collection and distribution of rail riders through these communities. The
performance of the Gold Line and Northwest Rail Line will be directly related to the
effectiveness of these intersecting bus routes; as such, the plan utilizes the following
service design strategies to ensure strong north-south connections:
• Improve service headhways to foster spontaneous-use travel and improve frequent
grid transfer connections to commuter rail service.
• Improve midday service levels to provide additional spontaneous use of transit for
all-day trip purposes.
• Transition any east-west route segments to new commuter rail trips where
appropriate.
Once completed, the Gold Line will attract the majority of east-west line haul travel into
Downtown Denver, deemphasizing the need for high capacity east-west bus routes in the
Gold Line and Northwest Rail Corridors. As line haul travel transitions to commuter rail
service, east-west bus routes in the Gold Line and Northwest Rail Corridors will function
primarily for local trip needs and network completion.

Resource Impacts

These recommendations encompass 353,000 annual revenue hours, 3.8 million annual
revenue miles and 80 peak buses. Tables 13 and 14 summarize the existing and
proposed resource impacts of the Gold and Northwest Corridor Bus Service Plan.
The plan includes notable changes in RTD bus operations:
• An increase of less than 1,000 service hours making the changes effectively
resource neutral.
• An increase of 3,400 Saturday annual service hours, representing a 2 percent
increase.
• An increase in overall weekday service hours, but a decrease in the peak bus
requirement by 21 due to the elimination of peak hour express services with high
resource requirements.
