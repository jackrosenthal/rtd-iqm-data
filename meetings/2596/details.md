### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Centennial Lyft Project

Bruce Abel, acting Chief Operating Officer, started off the meeting by congratulating the APTA RTD team that won the Top Honors at the 2017 International Bus Rodeo.  He stated that they will be recognized at May’s Board Meeting.

Mr. Abel introduced Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, to talk about the Centennial Lyft project.  Mr. Becker stated that in early 2016 the City of Centennial Innovation Team initiated the development of a first/last mile pilot project at the Dry Creek Light Rail station.  He explained how the team wanted to replace the RTD Call-n-Ride with Lyft.  The City of Centennial contracted with Lyft and offered both Lyft and Call-n-Ride to customers as part of the first/last mile plan.  He stated that in conjunction with providing this new service to riders the City of Centennial also hired a consultant to help develop a plan for this service.

Mr. Becker stated that the City of Centennial’s original estimate of how many trips would be provided by Lyft was 300 trips per day; though the total amount of Lyft trips for the six-month period averaged out to be 1,302 or approximately 10 trips a day.  He stated that each trip averaged $4.70, which was a discounted rate from Lyft.  He said that the City of Centennial also had to provide ADA transportation and contracted with Via Mobility to provide lift-equipped vans for approximately 13.5 hours per day, totaling $47,000 for six months.

Director Folska asked if RTD makes a contribution to any first/last mile programs.

Mr. Becker stated said that the Lone Tree Link is funded by Charles Schwab, Level 3 Communications, Sky Ridge Medical Center, and the City of Lonetree.  He said that RTD subsidizes service at Dry Creek.  Bruce Abel added that RTD provided logistical support to the Centennial program but did not provide any financial support.

Director Menten stated that she believes that there is a lot of potential in these pilot programs.  She asked if Jeff could provide her some information regarding the originating data from DRCOG that provided the residency stats.

Mr. Becker stated that information can be found as part of the municipality census data.

Director Broom asked if RTD gets any stats regarding how many people ride the Fitz Simmons shuttle service.

Mr. Becker said that he believes there were about 100 people riding it per day, but that is not current.  He will report back to Director Broom on the current numbers.

Director Lubow asked what the City of Centennial is thinking about doing with this program,moving forward.

Mr. Becker stated that he believes they would like to try it some more but he is unsure what City Council wants to do.

Mr. Abel stated that Daniel Hutton, the program coordinator for the Centennial Lyft pilot program, is now working for Denver South Economic Development. He stated that RTD had been in conversations with Denver South Economic Development on partnering in the future.

Director Lubow asked if we are looking at future additional pilot projects.

Mr. Abel stated that RTD is working with a lot of different entities on potential upcoming projects; no concrete proposals but definitely a lot of conversations.

Mr. Becker gave an example of a potential partnership with Dry Creek where RTD could partner with Lyft or another carrier to assist with transportation needs during peak/non-peak times.

Director Francone asked if Lyft was able to provide the same service that Call-n-Ride offers for a cheaper rate.

Mr. Abel stated that the average fee to ride a Lyft from that location is around $5.50, so that is cheaper; however, when it is an ADA transportation request it costs about $40 per trip where a Call-n-Ride trip would only average $11 per trip.

Mr. Becker stated that RTD must abide by rules and regulations must when transporting riders where Lyft does not need to abide by those rules.

Chair Hoy stated that there are a lot of conversations about the on-demand service.  He stated that it is important for the City of Centennial to figure out why their pilot program did not have the success they had hoped for.   He stressed how a report would be extremely helpful in assessing the lessons learned from this program.

Mr. Abel replied that the City of Centennial is currently doing a study on the program.  General Manager Genova also mentioned that the call center was not factored into the cost of delivery.  He said that technology accessibility to assist in scheduling the rides also needs to be considered.

##### a. Centennial-Lyft Board Memo - May 2017

#### 2. Bus Network Analysis Potential Transit Priority

Mr. Bruce Abel explained that RTD’s service development group conducted a study to identify areas where RTD could identify system slowdowns and areas where RTD can benefit from system improvements.  He said Mr. Becker would present findings in the study.

Mr. Becker said that reliability was a main concern found in the study.

He said one way to improve reliability is to give buses priority in the street right-of-way and in order to do this RTD would need to work closely with their municipality partners.  He explained that RTD previously hired a consultant to create an analysis to help RTD identify the areas where it would be most beneficial. He said the study was conducted throughout a 40,000 block radius and it looked at speed as a measure of delay and reliability along with passenger load to find out where RTD has the most transit users and where the study would benefit the most.

Bus Network Analysis for Potential Transit Priority

Study Goals

- Identify and prioritize corridors for transit priorities

- Transit priorities will:

o        Increase bus service speeds and reduce bus delay

o        Improve bus service reliability

o        Improve customer satisfaction

o        Lead to increased ridership and cost-effectiveness

- Support community investment in sustainable mobility through interagency coordination: Complete Streets, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian

RTD Bus Network

- All RTD bus routes broken down into 40,000 segments for detailed study

- Multi-step screening used to identify and prioritize corridors that best benefit from transit enhancements based on:

o        Speed - measure of delay and reliability

o        Passenger load – benefit the most customers

Speed

- Actual running times used to estimate speed at segment level

- Median speed 17 MPH

- Slower speeds in places as expected

Load

- Visualize areas with highest levels of passenger throughput

- Median load of 300 passengers per day

- High of 18,000 passengers

- Corridor loads also as expected

Index Score

- Captures areas with slowest speeds and highest loads (based on median values)

- Clusters of high scoring areas

- Corridors such Colfax and Broadway

- Use index score to identify short list of corridors

Top 15% Segments

- Captures areas with slowest speeds and highest loads (based on median values)

- Clusters of high scoring areas

- Corridors such Colfax and Broadway

- Use index score to identify short list of corridors

Corridor Continuity

- Identify continuous corridors

- Synergy with current service performance

- Bottom-up analysis

- Downtown focus

Priority Corridors

- Adjust alignments to complement radial and grid network

- Some already being addressed, e.g., E Colfax, US 36, Speer/Leetsdale

- Narrow priorities with city input

o        Downing Street

o        E 17th and 18th Avenues

o        E 12th Avenue

o        Federal Boulevard

o        W Colfax Avenue

o        Havana Boulevard

o        Broadway Street (Boulder)

Cooperative Transit Priority Treatments

- Bus lanes

- Traffic signal priority

- Queue jumps & bypass lanes

- Bus bulbs & bays

- Bus stop accessibility & amenities

Mr. Becker stated that the next step is to a create scope of work for each of the corridors that have been identified, once funding is available. He said that the scopes will be shared with the specific municipalities.

Mr. Able confirmed that RTD is currently meeting with the City of Boulder and the City of Aurora and has a standing monthly meeting with the City of Denver.

Director Folska asked if Denver has the largest transit geographical footprint in the United States.

Mr. Abel confirmed that the city is close to being the biggest.

Director Folska asked if RTD’s corridors are operating on hub and spoke.

Mr. Becker answered that it is a combination of hub and spoke and grid and that RTD has a big grid network. He stated that most people are headed downtown.

Director Folska stated that she has an idea that a combination of the grid and hub and spoke method in the suburban areas can be little wheels that spoke into the bigger wheel.

Mr. Becker said that method is similar to the first/last mile station that functions as a hub where multiple bus routes feed to the main routes.

Director Lubow stated that her initial concern when reading the presentation was the money being spent on the analysis and that the analyst seemed to be very Denver-centric.  She said that she noticed that the proposal would not benefit the people in the far-flung areas.  She mentioned that she spoke to someone at the City of Longmont who had never seen this proposal.

Mr. Abel stated that the analysis is customer-centric and it was based on where RTD has the most ridership and most delays.

Director Lubow replied by saying she understands that ridership is greater within the Denver region but her concern was that money was once again being redirected for Denver-based studies.

Director Anderson mentioned that Boulder County has conducted similar studies that involve diagonal travel to Longmont and bus bulbs.

Director Menten asked who the consultants were on the project and how much it had cost.

Mr. Becker stated that the study cost approximately $150,000 and the consultant was Transportation Management Design (TMD).

Director Francone stated that she recognizes that corridors that tend to have high ridership will get more money to conduct studies; however, she asked that RTD be mindful from redirecting monies from the outlining suburban areas.

Mr. Abel responded that studies of this type can work to the benefit of RTD.  He said that if transit signals become a priority, allowing buses to get through signals more rapidly than cars, then it will allow RTD to carry the same number of people on the buses and lessen the resource investment.  He said that this scenario would free up resources to allow improved services to the outlining areas.

Director Francone stated that RTD can build the best transportation system in the world but doing so will not make a difference unless people can get it.  She stated that she hears a lot from her suburban constituents that they want to travel downtown but cannot get there.  She commented that RTD can use money to smooth out the transportation needs of high ridership corridors or they can use that money to provide an extra bus to suburban areas during the middle of the day.

Director Broom said that people move out to the boondocks to separate themselves from higher populated areas; but noted that transit only works where there is adequate density.  He said that it does not make sense to have buses providing the same level of services to a sparsely populated area.

Committee Chair Anderson stated that transportation starts with local government and staff wants to identify those areas that have congestion and high ridership and make the trip easier.  She said that she applauds staff for looking for efficiencies in RTD’s services.

##### a. Transit priority - RTD Board, May 2017

#### 3. L Line Operations and Service Concept

Bruce Abel stated that the L line concept is not something that the new Board Members have seen.  He said it is a concept that they have shared with the Board in the past, it is a proposal that Operations wants to implement with the new August service changes.  Mr. Abel asked Eric Miller to provide the presentation.

Eric Miller, Senior Service Planner and Scheduler, stated that the L Line is part of the Central Rail Extension (CRE) and the concept will allow operations without construction of the extension to 38th and Blake Station. He said the concept would improve system reliability, on-time performance, and increase flexibility for future service.

How the L Line Proposal Fits with Other Light Rail Changes

- C Line replaces the D Line as base service for the Southwest Lines

- Helps with DUS connections, CU A Line service: every rail corridor has a one-transfer connection

- Special service to CPV events would be covered

with regular service: Rockies, Broncos, etc.

- E Line midday service increase to 15-minutes

D and L Line Change Proposals

- L Line replaces D Line between downtown and 30th & Downing

- L Line is scheduled to offset Route 43, providing even service during off-peak

C and D Line Change Proposals

- C Line becomes the base route for Southwest

- C Line increases to 15-minute base frequencies

most of the day, every day

- D Line turns into peak-oriented (similar to F Line)

E and F Line Change Proposals

- E Line midday service increased to 15-minute frequencies

- Keeps up with E Line growth, consistent service throughout the week, and CU A Line connections

Signal Work Required for 14th & Stout Intersection

- Two additional rail signals for switch movement

- Traffic signal for loop trains for transit signal phase

- Additional train to wayside communication (TWC) loop at 15th Street

Next Steps

- Approval of PUC Application (by end of June)

- Continued coordination with the City and County of Denver for signal work (July-August timeframe)

- Public outreach in advance of runboard process (this month)

- August 2017 service change public hearings (June)

Mr. Abel closed by saying that the D Line currently runs from Mineral to Welton.  He explained that the route is being split into two separate routes; 1) Mineral to Downtown doing the loop and heading back to Mineral, and 2) Welton to Downtown and looping back up to Welton. He mentioned that Welton is a single track component of the RTD network and controls the on-time performance throughout the network, which can be a benefit.  He stressed that staff’s primary concern is not to disrupt services and make sure that services are not compromised at the Auraria Campus.

Director Folska stated that she was concerned that there would be not service on the L Line on the weekends.

Mr. Miller stated that there would still be services and the L Line would run at the same times at the D Line does.

Director Folska said that she was under the impression that Mr. Miller stated that the L Line would not run on the weekends.

Mr. Miller responded that his team is proposing that the D Line not run on the weekends but instead the C Line will run.

Mr. Abel said that the Welton corridor will have the same services as it currently does.

Director Folska said she thought it was interesting that they were separating out the two routes. She asked what the implications would be if RTD was to reopen the station at 29th and Welton.

Mr. Abel responded that there would not be an impact if they were to reopen the 29th and Welton station.

Director Lubow comment that she was not happy with the headway on all the lines being at 15 minutes except the B Line which will be 30 minutes.  She congratulated the team on the potential cost savings of $2 Million if this plan is implemented and she suggested those savings be put in the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) account.

Director Deadwyler stated that she was very happy about the Welton street corridor and thought it would be a great idea to re-open the 29th Street Station. She asked about the loop and said that when services were originally discontinued it was because of the loop at 38th and Downing.  She asked where that loop would be located.

Mr. Miller said the south end loop would take place near 14th Street in front of the convention center.

Director Deadwyler stressed that she would like to see the 29th Street Station reopened.

Mr. Abel said he will include that proposal in future conversations regarding the L Line proposal.

#### 4. Proposed August 2017 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION

No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the public for review and comment.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. A notable modification to Light Rail operations in the Central and Southwest Corridors is proposed in the creation of L Line service plan. Additionally, bus stop consolidation efforts aimed at optimizing bus stop spacing, thereby improving operational speed and reliability are proposed for Routes 40, 105 and services along the Broadway/Lincoln Corridor. Based upon current and past ridership performance a number of services will have minor service reductions.  The Route 46 - South Dahlia will see the largest reduction in early morning and late evening periods.  We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a FasTracks cost of approximately $495,000 and a base system savings of approximately $431,650.

PUBLIC HEARINGS

There are five public hearings proposed to be held in Boulder, Curtis Park, Southeast Denver, Downtown Denver and Littleton between June 7st and June 14th. The public comment period will be concluded June 14, 2017.

Mr. Abel stated that implanting the L Line into the 2017 service changes is included in the plan and can be adjusted if RTD does not get approval from Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and City and County of Denver (CCD).

He also informed the Board that they have already approved G Line services and intermediate stations on the B line.  He stated that the agency will not be coming back to the Board with additional requests for approval on the G Line or B Line.

Mr. Abel asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, to provide more information.

Mr. Carter, stated that the L Line concept is included in the proposal as well as some bus stop consolidations to improve reliability.  He mentioned the introduction of a new route in Boulder, route 236, and some small changes on routes 205 and 206. He stated that there is a FasTracks cost increase of $495,000 and a base systems savings of $435,000.  Mr. Abel reminded the Board that the offsets are annualized for a full-year basis.

Mr. Carter informed Board that there will be five public meetings regarding the service changes: one in Boulder, one in Littleton, and three in Denver.

Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Board that the Service Change proposal goes out to the public for comment and staff will come back to the Board for final approval.

Director Francone asked if Mr. Carter could speak to the changes on routes 116, CB, and EB.

Mr. Carter stated that the changes are geared more towards the bus stop consolidation, shifting some of the stops so they are an equal distance from each other.  He said the change will help with some of the signals between the Broadway and Lincoln area and improve the liability of those services.

Director Francone expressed her happiness with the increased frequency of services.  She also shared that she had met with Mountain Resource Center and Senior Resource Center.  She said that Conifer and Evergreen would like another mid-day bus.   She said that she is not sure if ridership justifies it but noted the increase of population in that area.  She stated that there is a growing veterans population that comes to the Jefferson County Administration building for veterans’ services.  Director Francone asked to meet with Mr. Carter off-line to discuss in detail.

Director Sisk thanked Mr. Carter for taking services from his district due to no ridership, specifically routes 206 and 209.

##### a. Atch A  August 2017 Service Change

#### 5. 16th Street Mall (No Back-up)

Mr. Abel stated that he received a request from the CCD to work around some Meet in the Street activities this summer.  He said that RTD agreed to the following dates: Saturday, July 8th; Saturday, July 15th; and Saturday, July 22nd.  He said RTD will alter shuttle routes to operate from Denver Union Station to Curtis and from Curtis to Broadway.  He stated that the changes would result in fewer disruptions than last year’s events, and stated that only half of the 16th Street Mall would see disruptions.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that he is giving an update on the 16th Street Redevelopment Project.  He reminded the Board that RTD has been spending over $1 Million annually maintaining the 16th Street Mall and CCD is spending $300,000 annually.

He stated that staff has been looking at a number of different studies since November of 2011 to find ways to rehabilitate the transitway where shuttles run.  He said RTD, CCD and Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) have been looking at the broader concept via Meet in the Street events and through consultant studies.

Mr. Van Meter stated that in August 2016 the agency reported that the previous studies that were conducted were being reviewed by Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) and National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA).  He explained how CCD and DDP asked RTD to partner with them on a larger study to encompass the entire mall.  He confirmed that CCD has agreed to pay the full cost of the analysis in relation to NEPA requirements. Through the bid process CCD has selected CH2M Hill to help with the environmental study.  He stressed that he has made certain to RTD’s partners that our interest is only on the transitway where shuttles run, not on the environment surround it.

Mr. Van Meter informed the Board that in 2013, RTD received a grant from FTA in the amount of $10 Million dollars to help with the rehabilitation and construction efforts of 16th Street Mall transit guideway, with 80% of monies from federal dollars and 20% local. He stated that two years ago RTD also applied to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) for another grant for the same purpose.  He explained that RTD has a total of two grants geared toward the improvement of the 16th Street Mall.  He informed the Board that the DRCOG grant is due to expire in September of 2017 and if RTD does not have a concrete plan to use the funds then the DRCOG Board will have to make a decision on the future fund allocation. Mr. Van Meter explained that RTD has not been able to allocate the funds in the grant because there has not been an unanimous agreement among all partners involved in the rehabilitation of the 16th Street Mall. He stated that there are future meetings with FTA and CCD to brainstorm ways to obligate funds for design and engineering work on the transitway on the mall.

Director Folska stated that she liked the idea of the Meet in the Street event being broken up in smaller segments.

Director Menten stated she did not agree with the “use or lose it” analogy.  She said she believes that if RTD does not use the grant monies, the agency has an obligation to return it back to the taxpayers.

Mr. Van Meter reiterated that funds would only be used for the rehabilitation of the transitway only.

Director Broom asked Mr. Van Meter to explain the DRCOG grant process regarding timeline scopes.

Mr. Van Meter explained that, if an agency is on a one-year delay, they will be required to work with DRCOG staff to lay out a plan of recovery.  He said if the agency is delayed by a second year, grant will require a continuation decision by the DRCOG Board and it is their prerogative to cancel the grant. He said that if an agency is allowed another chance, then the Board will establish a deadline and meet with the agency regularly to see progress on the project.

Director Broom asked how many strikes RTD has against the grant right now.

Mr. Van Meter replied that RTD has one strike.

Director Broom stated that he thought that DRCOG offered an option to reinstate that grant at a later time once a decision has been made as long as funding is available.

Mr. Van Meter said that option has not been discussed, though he said that RTD and CCD have developed a very reasonable and aggressive schedule to help retain the grant.  He stated that CCD is motivated by their tax increment financing funds that can be used in support of the project but noted those funds also have a spending deadline.  He stressed that both RTD and CCD have interest in moving the project forward as quickly as possible.

Director Deadwyler asked why RTD is working based on the decisions of the CCD and not making firm decisions as an agency in moving forward.   She stated that she feels CCD is trying to convince us to go in the direction that they want.

Mr. Van Meter stated that RTD and CCD’s decisions align but in receiving federal funding, it is required that we go through the historic preservation offices and other consulting offices to receiving that funding. He stated that the historic value and interest need to be addressed and resolved before the project can move forward.

#### 6. Lost Service Hours Update

Bruce Abel presented lost hours report and there were no questions from Board.

### D. Other Matters

Director Sisk stated that former Mayor Karen Stuart was appointed to the State Transportation Commission.  He said it was a great choice by Governor Hickenlooper.

Director Folska informed the Board that there was a special on Rocky Mountain PBS regarding the entire rehabilitation process of Union Station and their partnership with RTD.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 7:02 p.m.
