Regional Transportation District
Our mission:
To meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.

To:

Operations and Customer Service Committee

From:

Jeff Becker, Senior Manager, Service Development

Subject:

Centennial Lyft Project

Date:

04.17.17

In early 2016 the City of Centennial Innovation Team initiated development of a first/last mile, ondemand, mobile-based public-private partnership pilot project at the Dry Creek Light Rail Station and
Call-n-Ride (CnR) service area to enhance services and ridership with expenses comparable to the
RTD's Call-n-Ride. The service operates in the same service area, days and time span as CnR and is
free, making it directly on par with CnR since a customer still needs a light rail ticket. Customers
must download apps and register with Lyft or the Go Denver multi-modal trip planner and also
indicate if an accessible vehicle is needed. Customers can also call Centennial Customer Service to
book a ride on the apps.
Centennial estimated from DRCOG data that “there are 1,530 residents who live in the Dry Creek
CnR area who commute to jobs near other light rail stations … and 680 employees who live near
other light rail stations and work in the Dry Creek CnR area.” Adding these together and with those
currently using CnR and park-n-ride, the total potential market was estimated to be approximately
4,600 one-way trips per day. Overall it was estimated that the adoption rate of the proposed service
would be 7% or approximately 300 trips per day. The service operated from August 18, 2016 to
February 15, 2017, attracting 1,302 total trips or approximately 10 per day.
Paying market rates for Lyft rides based on their formula which includes a base fare plus trip distance
and trip time, the average cost for these rides was about $5.50. In order to comply with ADA
requirements, Centennial contracted with Via Mobility (a nonprofit in Boulder) to provide a liftequipped van for 13.5 hours per day for a total of $47,000 for the six months. The budget also
included Xerox (Go Denver) hosting, data collection and analysis for $9,000. Not including any other
administrative costs, the total cost was about $63,000 or $48.50 per ride.
For comparison Dry Creek CnR average weekday ridership for the comparable 6-month period was
58 in 2015 and 53 in 2016. In 2015 the fully allocated (including vehicle amortization,
administration, etc.) subsidy was $20.92 per trip or $11.09 for direct operating subsidy only. It is
hard to tell what effect the Lyft service had on CnR ridership, since CnR ridership overall decreased

1.C.1.a

It is worth noting that the average daily Dry Creek Light Rail station activity (total ons & offs) for
August to December 2016 was 2,152. RTD’s overall transit market share (typical of our peers) is
about 6%, but this would be much higher to downtown—say 35%—and less for suburban first/last
mile trips—say 2%. Thus 60 trips represent a realistic 2.8% market share of station activity, as
opposed to the postulated 7% of Centennial commuters near rail stations. Another good comparison
is the Lone Tree Link which began September 2015 to provide free first/last mile service about every
10 minutes between the Lincoln rail station and Charles Schwab, Level 3 Communications and Sky
Ridge Medical Center with a total of about 7,700 employees. It currently averages about 320 riders
per day or (assuming 2 trips per employee) about 160 employees, which would be about a 2% share
of total employees. The employers and City of Lone Tree pay for this service at a cost of about
$524,000 per year or $6.50 per ride.

about 11% year-to-year; however, a soon to be finalized survey report of Lyft riders will shed light
on this. Total first/last mile ridership for both services was about 60 per day.

Bus Service

Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Delete existing westbound-only stop at Alameda/Xenia (no boardings), and add east- and
westbound stops at 8500 East Alameda, better serving multifamily developments.
Replace existing exception stops at Alameda/Leetsdale and Alameda/Forest with one
exception stop at Alameda/Dahlia. Ridership at Leetsdale and at Forest is very low, less
than 5 passengers/day, while Dahlia serves more development and has a safer pedestrian
crossing at a signalized intersection. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 11 - Mississippi Avenue
It is proposed that the westbound trip currently serving Mosier & Raritan at 7:48pm will no
longer serve the Mosier & Raritan loop. New service will be provided on Route 14 at
7:31pm. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 14 - West Florida Avenue
Based increased ridership on the Route 14, it is proposed to add two additional westbound
weekday evening trips departing I-25 & Broadway Station at 6:54pm and 7:24pm. It is
proposed to add an additional eastbound weekday evening trip departing Lakewood
Commons at 6:07pm. It also is proposed to add an additional eastbound Saturday morning
trip departing Lakewood Commons at 5:37am. It is proposed to add an additional
westbound Saturday evening trip departing I-25 & Broadway Station at 7:22pm.
It is proposed to add an additional eastbound Sunday morning trip departing Lakewood
Commons at 8:05am. It is proposed to add an additional westbound Sunday morning trip
departing I-25 & Broadway Station at 9:00am. Cost impacts are estimated to be $43,500
annualized.
Route 34 – Bruce Randolph Avenue
In concert with the new L-Line LRT service to 30th & Downing Station operating every 30
minutes during peak periods, the Route 34 would be rescheduled to also operate a
consistent 30 minute peak frequency, for proper connections with L-Line service. Cost
savings are estimated to be $97,400
Route 35 – Hampden
A 2:52pm eastbound trip is proposed, thus starting PM peak 30 minute frequency one
hour earlier. This change would better serve student ridership, notably from Thomas
Jefferson High School. Discontinuance of the 8:52am eastbound trip, which averages 7
passengers or 10.8 passengers per hour is also proposed. The cost impact is expected to
be neutral.

Packet Pg. 33

Attachment: Atch A August 2017 Service Change (3139 : Proposed August 2017 Service Change)

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
Reschedule eastbound PM peak trips to Aurora Metro Center, to depart Alameda Station
every 30 minutes at 4:59, 5:29, 5:59, and 6:29pm. This would provide a consistent 30
minute frequency at minimal cost, by utilizing current excess recovery on trips terminating
at Alameda Station. Anticipated cost impact is estimated to be $19,500 annualized.

1.C.4.a

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard
As part of the overall effort to improve service delivery and on-time performance, bus stop
consolidation analysis has been conducted on the Route 40 resulting in the following
proposal:

4400 East 48th Ave
Colorado/38th Ave
Colorado/16th Ave, southbound only
Colorado/14th Ave northbound moved to 13th Ave.

Colorado/Harvard Ave northbound
Colorado/Cornell Ave
Colorado/Eastman Ave
Colorado/Girard Ave
Hampden/Elm Street
Hampden/Ivy Way (westbound only)
Hampden/Locust Street (eastbound only)
No cost impacts are anticipated

Route 46 – South Dahlia Street
Discontinue service before 6:00am (5:46am northbound from Ulster/Tufts, 5:10 and
5:40am southbound from 1st/Milwaukee),due to low ridership. Ridership totals 26
passengers, 8.7 passengers/trip and 11.1 boardings/hour.
Discontinue service after 7:15pm (8:01 and 8:31pm from Clermont/Yale, and 7:34 and
8:04pm southbound from 1st/Milwaukee). Ridership totals 25 passengers on four trips, or
6.2 passengers/trip and 10.5 passengers/hour. Cost savings are estimated to be
$127,000 annualized
Route 83D/83L – Parker/Leetsdale Limited
Add Route 83D trips via Dayton and Quebec Way at 10:17am and 12:17pm eastbound,
and 11:09am and 1:09pm westbound. Provides midday service on 83D routing, extends
periods of 15-minute frequency during the midday to the trunk route on Leetsdale Drive
and Speer Boulevard through Cherry Creek. Cost impacts are estimated to be $58,500
annualized.

1.C.4.a

As part of the overall effort to improve service delivery and on-time performance, a bus
stop consolidation analysis has been conducted on the Route 105. The results of the
analysis support the elimination of the following bus stops; due to low usage and very
close proximity to better located and better utilized stops:
Central Park/35th Ave
Central Park/Verbena-Wabash
Central Park/Akron
Havana/10th Ave
2900 S Havana
Hampden/Galena

Anticipated cost savings impacts are estimated to be $107,000
Route 205/205T – 28th Street/ Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Running time adjustments, weekday; terminal relocation and trip time adjustments at
Heatherwood. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 206/206F – Pearl/Manhattan/Fairview High School
Mid-day, discontinue current routing south of 55th/Arapahoe due to extremely low
ridership less than one passenger per hour); maintain AM and PM half-hourly service on
current full route, as well as AM and PM school trippers. Trip time and minor service span
adjustments. Cost savings are expected to be an estimated $78,000 annualized.
Route 209/209G – CU/Table Mesa Station
Discontinue routing south of Baseline/Mohawk due to extremely low ridership; discontinue
‘Golden West loop’ due to no ridership; residents at Golden West Senior Center have
access to their own shuttle, as well as Access-a-Ride. Cost savings are expected to be an
estimated $78,000 annualized.
Route 236 – Boulder Junction/ Table Mesa Station
Responding to requests from the City of Boulder, Boulder County and University of
Colorado Boulder this proposal creates a new local route between Boulder Junction at
Depot Square Station and US36 & Table Mesa Station, mid-day, weekday only, at halfhourly frequency. This routing is in response to mid-day demand between Boulder Junction
and US36 & Table Mesa Station, as well as along the 28th Street corridor; it will result in
connections to/from CU Main and East Campuses to the already existing transit centers.
Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $156,000.

Packet Pg. 35

Attachment: Atch A August 2017 Service Change (3139 : Proposed August 2017 Service Change)

Route 105 – Havana Street
Reduce midday frequency south of Southmoor Station to Ulster/Tufts from every 15
minutes to every 30 minutes, between 9:00am and 3:00pm. Ridership during midday
averages just of 21 passengers per hour, which below the service standard for service
with 15 minute frequency.

1.C.4.a

Route DASH/JUMP
This proposal would break the interlining (sharing of vehicles between separate route
services) on Saturday for on-time performance improvements. The current interlining
practices are providing insufficient recovery time for operations on Saturday. Anticipated
cost impact are estimated to be $47,700 annualized.
Free MetroRide
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to address capacity issues in Union Station.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route L/LX/LNX/LSX – Longmont/Denver
It is proposed to rename the Longmont/Denver services with the two letter and numbering
designations, to provide clear distinction between the proposed light rail L Line service.
The new name for the services are proposed as follows:
L= LD 1
LX= LD 2
LNX= LX 1
LSX= LX 2
The renaming would be consistent with current naming conventions of Regional and BRT
services. No cost impacts are anticipated with this change.
Route SKIP – Broadway
Running time adjustments for better on-time performance and address some capacity
issues at CU start/end times
Broadway/Lincoln Bus Stops – Transit Accelerator Project
In order to improve travel times, reliability, and on-time performance it is proposed to
consolidate stops on Broadway and Lincoln Street for Routes 0 and 0L, optimized at about
¼ mile spacing. Stops will be removed on Broadway at 14th Ave (when Civic Center
Station is reopened), 7th Ave, Ellsworth Ave, Cedar Ave, Center Avenue, and Ohio Ave. A
new stop would be added at Virginia Avenue. Stops will be removed on Lincoln Street at
Walsh Pl, Center Ave, Cedar Ave, and Ellsworth Ave. This will be in conjunction with the
City & County of Denver as part of the NACTO Transit Accelerator Project. The City &
County of Denver will be converting the bus lane on Broadway and on Lincoln Street north
of Speer Blvd to 24-hour operation.
Broadway/Lincoln Limiteds - Routes 0L, 3L, 83L/D, 87L, 100L
It is proposed to standardize the limited stops on Broadway and Lincoln Street between
Colfax Ave and I-25 & Broadway Station to be common among all routes. Southbound
Limited Stops will be along Broadway at 13th Ave, 9th Ave, 1st Ave, and Alameda Ave.
Northbound Limited Stops will be along Lincoln Street at Alameda Ave, 1st Ave, 9th Ave,
and 13th Ave.

Downtown Bus Stops – Routes 0, 6, 52
Due to its proximity to the stop at Broadway & Cleveland Pl, it is proposed to remove the
stop at 17th Ave & Tremont Pl.
Due to its proximity to the stop at 18th St & Stout St, it is proposed that Route 0 would
no longer stop at 18th St & California St.
Seasonal and School Service
Changing to fall service levels for Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP, N and STAMPEDE
Re-instating school trippers on the following services:
Route 1W – West 1st Avenue
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Route 24 – University Blvd.
Route 30L – South Federal Limited
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard
Route 50 – Lakes Crosstown
Route 52 – West 52nd/South Bannock
Route 65 – Monaco Parkway
Route 73 – Quebec Street
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/North 19th
Route 205/205T – 28th Street/ Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Route 206/206F - Pearl/Manhattan/Fairview High School
Route 208/208F – Iris/Valmont

Special Services
BroncosRide
This proposal discontinues the BroncosRide service at East High School. BroncosRide
service at East High operates Sundays only (no preseason or weeknight service). Sunday
ridership averages 47 boarding’s per game. The Route 15L operates on Colfax and provides
a direct alternative service to the Federal and Decatur Station.
On Sundays The 15L
operates every 15 minutes up to 6:00pm, then operates every 30 minutes. Cost impact is
estimated to be a savings of $8,356 annualized.

Call-n-Ride
Longmont Call-n-Ride
As part of effort to reduce trip denials due to increased demand, which has been increasing
over the past year; this proposal recommends adjusting weekday hours on vehicles already
in operation in the Longmont Call-n-Ride. The first adjustment would have 2 buses in service

Broadway/Lincoln Regionals - Routes 116X, CV/CS/CX, EV/ES/EX, P
It is proposed to standardize the Regional stops on Broadway and Lincoln Street between
Colfax Ave and I-25 & Broadway Station to be common among all routes. Southbound
Regional Stops will be along Broadway at 13th Ave and 9th Ave. Northbound Regional
Stops will be along Lincoln Street at 9th Ave and 13th Ave. Route P will no longer serve
Alameda Ave.

1.C.4.a

Orchard Call-n-Ride
It is recommended that the boundary of this Call-n-Ride be adjusted enabling more efficient
operation of the service. Recommendations: 1. Adjust northern boundary from Progress
Place to Belleview Avenue for customers staying at an extended stay hotel just north of
Progress Avenue. 2. Adjust southern boundary to serve north side of Arapahoe Road only.
Currently, Call-n-Ride serves addresses on south side of Arapahoe Road. Crossing Arapahoe
Road has been difficult due to traffic congestion. 3. Discontinue the area west of Monaco,
east of Holly and north of Orchard due to low ridership. 4. Restrict the Call-n-Ride from
serving the area around Fiddler’s Green Amphitheatre on event days due to traffic
congestion. No costs are associated with this change.

Rail Service
C, D, and L Line proposal
This proposal is contingent upon completion of traffic signal construction and PUC
approval of operations along the 14th Street Loop. If construction or approvals are not
completed prior to the August 2017 Service Change, the proposal would be postponed
until the following service change period:
L Line: It is proposed to separate the operation of the D Line into two lines. The D Line
would operate as it does today between Mineral Station and downtown, with all trains
turning at 19th Street. The Welton Street segment would operate as its own service, the
L Line, as proposed in the Central Rail Extension Mobility Study. The L Line would operate
between downtown and 30th & Downing Station, with all trains turning at 14th Street.
This allows service to be better tailored to the two different segments, including vehicle
consist assignments and will increase reliability of service along Welton Street, especially
in the northbound direction.
C Line: It is proposed to increase the weekday service frequency from 30 minutes to 15
minutes and also run later at night, similar to the E Line. Vehicle consists will be a mix of
2- and 3-car trains, similar to the W Line. It is also proposed to operate the C Line on
weekends and holidays instead of the D Line; frequencies and span of service on the C
Line would be similar to the existing D Line.
D Line: It is proposed to reduce weekday peak service frequency from an average of 10
minutes to 15 minutes and increase vehicle consist lengths from three cars to four cars.
The lower frequency during the weekday peak periods would be replaced by the increase
in C Line and new L Line service. It is proposed to reduce weekday midday service from
15 minutes to 30 minutes and cover the reduced service with additional C Line and L Line
trips. It is also proposed to reduce evening and late night service and cover this service
with C Line and L Line trips. This proposal responds to ridership trends, especially on
evenings and weekends, for service to the Union Station area, including airport
connections, and helps with event service in the Central Platte Valley. This maintains the
corridor frequency among the lines in the Southwest Corridor.

Attachment: Atch A August 2017 Service Change (3139 : Proposed August 2017 Service Change)

during the lunch hour rather than one bus. The second adjustment would keep a peak hour
bus in service for the entire year rather than just the school year. Annualized costs are
estimated to be $72,900, including fuel.

1.C.4.a

E Line
It is proposed to increase the frequency of service in the weekday midday period (9:30 AM - 2:30
PM) to a straight 15-minute service. The F Line would continue to run a 30-minute frequency as
it does now (and interlined with the D Line, concurrent with the C and D Line proposal). This
responds to recent ridership growth on the E Line, which is outpacing the other lines. It helps with
connections to the new commuter rail and bus services at Union Station that have recently opened
or will be opening in the future. This proposal brings back the midday service that was lost after
the January 2012 service cuts, creates a less-confusing midday service for passengers, and helps
with special events. Additionally, smoothing out the midday service helps improve operator
workdays.

This change requires 3 trains to operate an additional 3.5 weekday hours for approximately 2,500
annual operating hours. Anticipated cost impact is estimated to be $495,000 annualized.
Rail lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for the University of Colorado A Line and the
R Line on all service days. This will not alter the trips and the same service will be
provided. No changes in hours are anticipated.

Packet Pg. 39

Attachment: Atch A August 2017 Service Change (3139 : Proposed August 2017 Service Change)

This proposal has savings in both operating hours and vehicle miles. Total annual car
hours saved: 5,100 (approximately 1,800 annual operator hours); total annual car miles
saved: 493,400. Cost impacts are estimated to be a savings of approximately $334,000
annualized.
