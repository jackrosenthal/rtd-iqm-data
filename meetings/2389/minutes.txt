Academy. He believes this is something richly deserved and reflects the caliber of staff
working with the Board of Directors.

General Manager Executive Search Committee Update
Chair Sisk shared that the General Manager Executive Search Committee (GMESC)
completed a very long journey last week that he was honored to be a part of. He said at
5:37 p.m. on Friday, December 11, the Board voted to enter into contract negotiations
with Interim General Manager Genova. He acknowledged that IGM Genova faced some
stiff competition from the other finalists; however, IGM Genova’s accomplishments,
credentials, and passion for RTD made him the Board’s selection. Chair Sisk believes one
of the challenges for IGM Genova is that RTD needs to do better. RTD has been at a very
high level but we need to exceed that level. He recognized that this is a tough
commitment but knows that IGM Genova can make that commitment.
Chair Sisk thanked Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of Directors, for all of her
dedication and hard work throughout this process. He recognized the GMESC members
for their time as well. He reiterated that this was a long journey but one that was very
thorough and transparent.

VIII.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Committee Chair Bagley indicated there would be an executive session after the main part
of the Board Meeting for further conversation about the review of Interim General Manager
Genova.

XIV. Motion to Take from Table
A.

2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award

It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option
to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance
through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually
between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board
of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to
exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been
reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist
and no additional positions for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has
reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to
the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
