## VII. General Manager Executive Search Committee Update

Chair Sisk shared that the General Manager Executive Search Committee (GMESC) completed a very long journey last week that he was honored to be a part of.  He said at 5:37 p.m. on Friday, December 11, the Board voted to enter into contract negotiations with Interim General Manager Genova.  He acknowledged that IGM Genova faced some stiff competition from the other finalists; however, IGM Genova’s accomplishments, credentials, and passion for RTD made him the Board’s selection.  Chair Sisk believes one of the challenges for IGM Genova is that RTD needs to do better.  RTD has been at a very high level but we need to exceed that level.  He recognized that this is a tough commitment but knows that IGM Genova can make that commitment.

Chair Sisk thanked Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of Directors, for all of her dedication and hard work throughout this process.   He recognized the GMESC members for their time as well.  He reiterated that this was a long journey but one that was very thorough and transparent.
