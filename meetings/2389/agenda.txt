2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award

It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option
to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance
through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually
between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board
of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to
exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been
reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist
and no additional positions for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has
reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to
the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.

Access-a-Ride service to Transdev On Demand in 2015. The total dollar amount of the
budget transfer is $686,000.

Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board
of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a
contract with the Seniors’ Resource Center for the provision of the “Evergreen Call-nRide” contracted demand response transit services. This contract is for three years
with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount includes $1,597,481 for service
for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years for a total amount
not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract amount also includes
two (2) one-year options in the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel
for a total of $599,262 for option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for
fuel for a total of $616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five

year period is not to exceed $2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a total of
$2,912,935. These costs are based on an hourly rate and include estimated fuel
costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will reimburse the Contractor’s
actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible
proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this
service is scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.
