2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award

It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option
to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance
through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually
between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board
of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to
exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been
reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist
and no additional positions for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has
reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to
the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.

XV.

Unanimous Consent
B.

2015 Year End Budget Transfer for Access-a-Ride

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel
line items of the Via Mobility budgets to the service line item of the Transdev On Demand
budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the assignment of additional
Access-a-Ride service to Transdev On Demand in 2015. The total dollar amount of the
budget transfer is $686,000.
C.

Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board
of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a
contract with the Seniors’ Resource Center for the provision of the “Evergreen Call-nRide” contracted demand response transit services. This contract is for three years
with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount includes $1,597,481 for service
for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years for a total amount
not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract amount also includes
two (2) one-year options in the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel
for a total of $599,262 for option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for
fuel for a total of $616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five

year period is not to exceed $2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a total of
$2,912,935. These costs are based on an hourly rate and include estimated fuel
costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will reimburse the Contractor’s
actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible
proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this
service is scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.
D.
Authorization to enter into fixed-price contract with Cambridge Systematics for a
new RTD Trip Planner (15DJ005)
It is recommended by the RTD Operations and Customer Services Committee that the

C. Updates

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino from the Squire Patton Boggs Denver Office, introduced Patricia
Doersch, Ed Newberry, and Anne Miano from the Squire Patton Boggs
Washington, D.C. office.
Ed Newberry, Global Managing Partner for Squire Patton Boggs, thanked the
Directors for trusting their firm for the past 15 years and for allowing them
to work together turning FasTracks into reality. He noted that throughout
the years RTD has received $2.8 billion in Federal funding. He added that
the job is never done and Squire Patton Boggs is working on figuring out
where the next $2 billion will come from.
Patricia Doersch, member of the firm’s Transportation, Infrastructure and
Local Government Public Policy Practice, and Anne Miano, Consultant at
Squire Patton Boggs, reviewed the Federal Update presentation included in
the Government Relations Committee agenda packet for December 1, 2015.
The presentation included:
 RTD’s special achievements:
o $2.8 billion received in Federal funding throughout the years
o Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) as the 5th New Starts Project
o Leading Voice in Public Transportation
 2016 Openings: CU A Line, Flatiron Flyer, B Line, G Line, and R Line
 RTD’s Federal Priorities: New Starts Projects, Authorization Bill, and
New Opportunities
 State of play on transportation Issues in Washington

Patricia Doersch highlighted that the SERE as the 5th New Start project is
commendable. She noted that the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA)
Award to the SERE Environmental Assessment is one of only eleven
awarded in the history of the FTA. This, she added, speaks to RTD’s quality
in project, staff, and Board leadership.
Anne Miano pointed out that RTD’s projects have changed the face of
Denver over the years. She highlighted that the Authorizations Bill would
probably wrap up by Friday, December 11th. She added that the firm has
worked closely with Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, and
Director Francone, who have reached out to the Colorado delegation
regarding transit matters. She added that some controversial issues may
find their way to the Appropriations Bill.
Patricia Doersch noted that due to the quick turnaround, the bill will probably
have a lot of errors in it and a Technical Corrections Bill would be issued.
This would be an opportunity for Squire Patton Boggs to lobby for technical
improvements on behalf of RTD. She pointed out that Congress cannot find
the will to fully fund the Appropriations Bill; yet do not want to cut costs,
either. She added that she is confident, not certain, that SERE will be
awarded Federal funding due to the enormous local match, which
distinguishes the project from others.
Mike Dino added that as the Board looks forward to the March 2016 visit to
Washington, D.C., they should also consider other sources of funding.
Some examples include the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of
Labor, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Economic
Development Administration. He acknowledged that RTD is a transit
agency; however, so many RTD projects influence Denver in so many
capacities making these other sources a possibility.
Director Lubow asked where the definition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is at in
terms of keeping flexibility and the ability for RTD to receive funding.
Patricia Doersch explained that the FAST Act provides greater flexibility for
BRT as it dropped the requirement for frequent rides on the weekends. The
language that would include the US36 Project in the BRT definition was not
accepted: separated right of way, traffic with toll paying vehicles, etc. She
recalled Directors Francone and Solano’s passionate case to the House and

Senate staffers back in March, 2015. The staffers opposed the position as
they view the New Starts program as the one pot they still control in transit.
They believe that expanding the eligibility would water down the money.

Director Hoy was curious about how the Colorado Congressional Delegation
votes in transit matters since they seem to be very supportive when meeting
with the Directors. Patricia Doersch said that the firm has addressed bill
languages with some of the delegates that was concerning to RTD. She
noted that Congressman Buck and Senator Bennett called Chair Shuster
from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee regarding language in
the bill. As a result, the language was removed. Director Hoy expressed his
surprise at Congressman Buck’s support. Patricia Doersch noted that Squire
Patton Boggs was asked to lobby the “un-lobbyable”. Ed Newberry added
that traditionally there is not a lot of support for transit; however, RTD has
had a great deal of success because of compelling projects and the
excellence of the teams behind the projects, both staff and Directors. This
combination makes it hard to not support RTD.
Anne Miano praised Marla Lien, General Counsel, for her amazing work on
the SERE Environmental Assessment. She added that she is very proud to
work with her as she holds great stature in the transit community. Patricia
Doersch echoed the sentiments on Marla Lien, adding that she is well
respected in Congress.
Chair Sisk said that it is never too early to talk about the March visit to
Washington, D.C. He asked Squire Patton Boggs what the key message for
that visit should be. He hopes this could be discussed during the February
Government Relations committee meeting in order to be well informed by
the time the March visit happens. Chair Sisk thanked Director Francone for
her work with the Colorado Congressional Delegation. He also thanked the
Directors for moving forward with the SERE project which, even though not
unanimous in vote, has moved forward as a regional project with regional
support. He added that the Northwest Rail Line is next to receive funding.
Director Anderson thanked Squire Patton Boggs for all their work throughout
the years and for helping RTD achieve so much for transit in the whole
region. She looks forward to making a difference during the March visit to
Washington, D.C.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 1, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow wondered about the eligibility of the other proposed BRTs
within RTD since most of them will not be operate on a separate lane.
Patricia Doersch explained that there are two types of BRT eligible under
New Start: Traditional and Small Start. The latter one is a corridor BRT not
required to have a separate Right of Way. This program is now under the
FAST Act. The federal contribution is $100 million and the overall project
cost is $300 million.

Chair Folska said it has been a privilege working with Squire Patton Boggs
and praised their incredible professionalism and credibility. She added that
because of their efforts, RTD will open 5 lines in 2016 and will hopefully
open the Northwest Rail Line by 2020. She agreed with Chair Sisk in the
importance of having a message; however, she added that the secret sauce
over the past 15 years has been building relationships with local and federal
stakeholders. She thanked Squire Patton Boggs for being a critical part of
building and sustaining those relationships. She thanked them for bringing
former Secretary of Transportation Slater to meet with the Board in February
of 2015. His story was very inspirational and RTD has benefited from his
legacy in the Department of Transportation.
Committee Chair Folska also thanked CRL Associates and
Brandeberry~McKenna, RTD’s local and state lobbyists, for their work in
2015.

D. Other Matters
Committee Chair Folska reminded the Directors of the January 28, 2016 event for
State Legislators and Board Members at Denver Union Station to continue building
relationships and dialogue.
Committee Chair Folska thanked Chair Sisk for trusting her to chair the Government
Relations Committee through 2015. She thanked Squire Patton Boggs and Sherry
Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, for their work. She noted that without
their efforts RTD would not have been awarded Federal funding.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of 2016 Granite Paver Maintenance Contract Amendment for 16th
Street Mall Transitway Lanes
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to amend the contract for 16th Street Mall
maintenance with the Gallegos Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the
contract end date from the current end date of July 31, 2016 to December
31, 2016 and increase the total Contract value by $1,000,000 to a total of
$3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016 Adopted
Budget.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for
Capital Programs, pointed out that this recommended action is
not an additional request for funding. RTD is committed to
spend $1 million annually in maintenance of the 16th Street
Mall Transitway. The City and County of Denver (Denver)
contributes up to $300,000 per year. The recommended
action asks to extend the contract with the current contractor,
Gallegos, until the end of 2016. The plan is to launch a
Request for Proposal (RFP) process in 2016 to secure a new
contract by 2017.

Director Lubow wondered how the conversation of changing
the mall from granite to cement fits into this recommended
action. Henry Stopplecamp replied that it does not fit in this
conversation. He explained that the recommended action is
for the maintenance of the Mall as required by the InterGovernmental Agreement (IGA) with Denver from three years
ago. This IGA is a continuation of the lawsuit from the late
80’s which called for RTD maintain the Mall transitway for the
next 30 years. The process to look at alternative materials is
under way. Director Lubow asked if that process would
preclude this maintenance cost. Henry Stopplecamp replied
that it potentially could if the recommendation is a concrete
solution. Director Lubow asked for confirmation that we are
waiting for the alternate material process to be done. Henry
Stopplecamp confirmed that was the case.
Director Francone wondered if RTD typically spent the $1
million budgeted for maintenance of the 16th Street Mall.
Henry Stopplecamp replied in the affirmative, adding that it
has been above the budgeted amount in recent years.
Director Francone asked what would happen if the alternative
materials process moved at a speedy pace rendering Gallegos’
service not necessary. Henry Stopplecamp replied that
Gallegos is paid for work performed. He added that in the
event of changing the transitway, there would still have to be
a contract awarded to pull out the pavers. Whenever that
happens, staff would recommend going back to Denver to
agree on next steps.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 1, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jeff Cluphf, Park-n-Ride Construction Manager, added that the
average daily maintenance of the 16th Street Mall is $3,000.
Part of the issues are caused by the 300 freeze and thaw
cycles the 16th Street Mall Transitway sees on an annual basis
combined with the wheel traffic. He added that Gallegos has
been diligently working on the project. Their work has a 2
year warranty, noting that they are vested in the project. He
pointed out that the last contractor could not keep up with the
maintenance so they did not submit a bid during the last RFP.
Jeff Cluphf hopes for competitive bids for the next contract.

Director Bagley made the motion to move this

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development,
reminded the Directors that staff presented the recommended
changes to the policy in June. Staff offered to meet one-onone with the Directors to discuss any comments and/or
concerns in August, and presented a draft to the Board in
November. She noted that there were no comments on this
particular policy. She added that most of the changes from
the draft to the final document are clarifications and language
clean ups.
Director Bagley said that he has carefully read both this policy
and the Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property Policy.
He noted that he spent about 40 minutes with Kate Iverson on
the phone about two weeks ago discussing the documents.
He believes that both of these documents deserve Board
approval.

• Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development,
shared that the main concerns with this policy throughout the
revision process had to do with notice and transparency. The
final version of the policy removes the sole source criteria.
Staff would still work with adjacent property owners first
when dealing with small pieces of property that are not
needed. When an unsolicited proposal is received, staff will
evaluate the agency’s need and the proposal’s technical merit.
If the proposal measures well in these two areas, then staff
would move forward with the competitive process.
Director Bagley noted that there are a few current projects,
such as the Alameda Station and the University of Denver
Station Senior Housing, that are examples of this policy. He
reminded the Directors that price is not the only factor when
evaluating these types of projects. He noted that the
relationship with the community is critical as the community
may benefit from certains developments, such as affordable
housing and other issues pertinent to the area.
Director Folska highlighted the importance of streamlining
processes and procedures to attract viable developers and
build new streams of revenue. She added that finding the
balance of what is great for developers and what is in the best
interest of RTD is a tough job. She praised staff for their work
on this policy.
Director Lubow thanked staff for their openness to comments
and making the document stress the competitiveness and
transparency.
Chair Sisk thanked staff for their work on the policy. He
expressed his satisfaction with the elimination of sole source
from the document. He reiterated the importance of

transparency for the agency. He noted that in the past he has

Director Anderson pointed out that she supports the hard work
that has gone into working on this policy. She added that she
is in favor of the more explicit open process.

B. Citizens Advisory Committee Update
Bob Rizzuto, Co-Chair of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC), thanked the
Directors for the opportunity to present the CAC’s thoughts and receive feedback
on the future direction of the CAC. He noted that Cindy Stovall, Co-Chair of the
CAC, was not able to be in attendance.
Bob Rizzuto reminded the Directors that the CAC was formed in 2005 after the
approval of FasTracks to recommend ideas to the Board from the citizen’s
perspective. As the FasTracks projects wind down, he noted that Committee Chair
Hoy asked the CAC to bring to the Board a recommendation on what the future of
the CAC could look like. The CAC drew feedback from its members, RTD staff,
and from the Directors through one-on-two meetings held earlier in the year.
Bob Rizzuto told the Directors that the CAC proposes that the committee continues
to be a body of 17 members from throughout the area, not per District. The CAC
would be committed to the District’s plan and long term vision. The CAC would
provide region oriented advice while representing the citizen’s perspective on a
wide range of issues, not just FasTracks, while gathering information from the
community and sharing it with the Board. The CAC would also perform any other
tasks as assigned by the Board.
Committee Chair Hoy noted that as the CAC matures the focus needs to evolve and
that it is important to see how the CAC could be the most effective. He said that
Roger Sherman, from CRL Associates, did a great job helping the CAC move
through this process.

Director Bagley thanked Bob Rizzuto and the CAC for their efforts. He echoed
Committee Chair Hoy’s thoughts of seeing how the CAC evolves as it become
active in other issues that RTD faces. He pointed out that he spent two hours on
his meeting with the two CAC members and he could tell the CAC wants to be
engaged as it morphs beyond FasTracks to many other facets of operations and
maintenance, relationship to the public, etc.

Director Francone said that the CAC is an incredible and important asset to the
agency as an informed and dedicated group of volunteers. She is glad the CAC will
still be around. She praised the CAC for their nimbleness and asked Bob Rizzuto to
extend her thanks to the whole CAC.
Director James wondered if the document could be more specific. He pointed out
that the CAC could be very effective promoting better understanding between RTD
and citizens. He suggested a higher involvement of the CAC in service planning as
well as strategic planning in order to provide more input and transparency.
Chair Sisk thanked the CAC. He mentioned that the Directors would like to keep
the CAC engaged in RTD as it is a benefit to the agency and the Board. He noted
that he would like the CAC to still be involved in providing input on FasTracks as
well as providing input into other areas.
Committee Chair Hoy restated the importance of the CAC evolving to serve new
needs.
Director Anderson said that she was in agreement with what has been expressed.
She appreciates the CAC looking into the future. She echoed Chair Sisk’s remarks
about the CAC still being engaged with FasTracks as it is not over. Bob Rizzuto
noted that the CAC is committed to see FasTracks finished.

C. Recommended Actions
No recommended actions were presented.

D. Updates

• U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
introduced Svetlana Greshka, Senior Engineer for the U.S. 36 Project. She
reviewed the U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Update presentation as
included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee agenda packet for
December 1, 2015. The presentation included a general overview of the

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 1, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow thanked the CAC for their dedicated work. She mentioned that the
Directors could not hear too much from the public. She asked the CAC to bring
back to the Board a summary of public feedback on a regular basis.

6.C

Director Folska noted that she could feel the team’s excitement through the
presentation. She asked staff to clarify the news she listened to on
Colorado Public Radio regarding legislature that needs to happen in order for
BRT to function. Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that the Assistant
General Managers knew about the issue before the end of the last legislative
session; the biggest issue was to get the rest of the parties on board. The
issue is that you cannot drive or pass on a shoulder. While the project was
in process, RTD asked the Attorney General how to handle the bus on
shoulder operation as part of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). The
Attorney General replied that the Colorado Department of Transportation
designs the lanes and the sign will say “designated lane”. RTD did not see
the signs until the very end of the last legislative session. The signs read
“Bus on Shoulder”.
Marla Lien said that she immediately contacted the attorney assigned to
CDOT by the Attorney General asking if legal status would be needed. The
attorney, who was very supportive, said that would not be necessary since
it would be an amendment to Title 42, which is basically the operation of
highways. RTD met over the summer with State Patrol, CDOT, and the
Attorney General’s office. State Patrol told RTD over email that they would
not ticket RTD drivers using the shoulder; however, they do not control all
the ticketing since there are also local jurisdictions. State Patrol and the
Attorney General’s office were both in favor on legislation to clarify the
language; however, CDOT was not. After multiple meetings where RTD
stated that we would not operate on shoulder unless there was clarifying
legislation on the legality of riding on shoulder, CDOT decided to go forward
and seek legislation. She added that staff expects a bill to be introduced in
January. Marla Lien stressed that she was not critical of CDOT’s process
as she understood the political implications of such a request.
Director Folska asked Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO,
when the safety campaign would be launched. Dave Genova replied that it
will be launched in mid-January.
Director Bagley recalled that U.S. 36 was one of the pet projects of John
Tayer, former Director for District O. He said he is looking forward to
visiting former Director Tayer in Boulder using the Flatiron Flyer come midJanuary. He is excited to see BRT, something new to RTD, be done in this
era of mobility. He echoed the message expressed in the Longmont TimesCall by Will Toor, former Boulder County Commissioner, supporting BRT for
the Northwest area.

B. 2015 State of the District Address (David Genova)
Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, introduced the Senior Leadership
Team:
 Marla Lien, General Counsel
 Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager (AGM) for Communications
 Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and AGM for Finance &
Administration
 Bob Grado, Acting Transit Police Chief, sitting in for John Tarbert, Acting
AGM for Safety, Security, and Facilities

 Terry Emmons, AGM for Rail Operations
 Henry Stopplecamp, Acting AGM for Capital Programs
He also introduced Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for the Civil Rights Department and
Brian Iacono, Senior Manager for the Materials Management Department.
Dave Genova reviewed the State of the District presentation as included in the
Operations and Customers Service Committee agenda packet for December 8,
2015. The presentation included the structure, 3 Major Accomplishments, 3 Goals
for 2016, and 3 Challenges for 2016 for each department. He highlighted the
following challenges and priorities for the District as a whole:
 Safety as the District’s number one priority

The 2016 openings as a challenge for every RTD department
Human capital retention
Fiscal Sustainability in light of new operating costs, new fare structure,
service planning changes, competing priorities, and project deferrals
Identifying funding to complete FasTracks

He summarized that the General State of the District is financially stable, positioned
well to meet all of the 2016 challenges, and ready to maintain service without
reductions while maintain the State of Good Repair. Dave Genova credited the
leadership of the Board of Directors and the staff as key elements on RTD’s current
position moving forward. He added that he is not aware of any other transit
agency that has had 5 line openings in a single year.
Director Folska thanked Dave Genova for the wonderful, comprehensive look at the
District. She agreed that RTD is in a very unique position in opening 5 new lines in
one year. She noted there had been discussion of safety but she asked that staff
think very deeply about safety and security as we move forward with the new
openings.
Director Lubow thanked Dave Genova for the comprehensive report. She
congratulated the Senior Leadership Team for their great work this year. She
expressed her pride in being a part of the Board of Directors.
Director Bagley asked Dave Genova about working with the private sector to fund
the four uncompleted corridors. He wondered when the Directors would receive
more information on this matter. Dave Genova replied that staff is having several
meetings before the end of the year. Staff will come to the Board either in January
or February of 2016 with more information. If there seems to be some interest
from the private sector, staff may recommend a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a
financial advisor to work with staff. Director Bagley noted the similarity between
this process and the Eagle P3 process in 2010. He assumed that all this
information will be available to the Board. Dave Genova confirmed that the
information will be available to the Board.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for their work and leadership.
that RTD has an excellent team running a successful and busy agency.

She said

Dave Genova noted that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has new safety
rules as well as asset management and State of Good Repair rules that RTD is
already meeting, which he will cover in more detail during updates. There might be
new American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and new Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) requirements. RTD will continue to work with the private sector regarding
technology and FasTracks.

• Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee
that the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his
designee, to enter into a contract with the Seniors’ Resource Center for
the provision of the “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” contracted demand response
transit services. This contract is for three years with two (2) one-year
options. The contract amount includes $1,597,481 for service for the
first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years for a total
amount not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract
amount also includes two (2) one-year options in the amounts of
$564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel for a total of $599,262 for
option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for fuel for a total
of $616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five
year period is not to exceed $2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel
for a total of $2,912,935. These costs are based on an hourly rate and
include estimated fuel costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through”
(RTD will reimburse the Contractor’s actual direct fuel costs). This
proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased
transportation service and fuel line items of the Via Mobility budgets to the
service line item of the Transdev On Demand budget to cover the variation

received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to
provide this service is scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.
Motion:

Director Francone made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Director Francone thanked Brian Matthews, Manager for
Special Services, for all the work negotiating the contract with
the Seniors’ Resource Center in Evergreen. She asked him to
give the Board an idea of the quality of service the Seniors’
Resource Center provides. Brian Matthews noted that the
Seniors’ Resource Center has been contracted for the
Evergreen Call-n-Ride for 10 years. He added that this
contractor is the one with the least complaints received. The
complaints are really not complaints but requests for service
outside the service area. Brian Matthews said that they
provide a high quality service.

• Approval of General Manager Authority Regarding Eagle Project Operations

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the Interim
General Manager to execute all necessary work orders, change orders and
amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the
operation and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the
Eagle Project pursuant to the previously executed Concession Agreement in
accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.

Discussion:

Director Lubow noted that the recommended action seems to
be a change from the original agreement so that the Board
does not need to approve changes that, in the past, were
approved by the Directors. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
explained that the recommended action does not change the
original agreement. She noted that the Board gave authority
to the General Manager in 2009 during the construction phase
to execute contracts or contract amendments. The current
recommended action requests giving authority to the General
Manager during the operations and maintenance phase.
Moving forward, the Board would still be approving changes in
two ways: through service changes and through the budget.
As it stands today the Board would have to approve
everything twice. This would remove the extra approval.

• Authorization to enter into fixed-price contract with Cambridge Systematics
for a new RTD Trip Planner (15DJ005)
It is recommended by the RTD Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General
Manager or his designee to enter into a $763,757.00 fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) for design, development, testing, and
release of RTD’s new Trip Planner.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December 15,
2015 Board meeting.
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications,
introduced Will Adams, Senior Manager for Customer Care,
Ashley Rice, Program Manager for IT, and Dan Jackson, Lead
GIS Architect. Scott Reed noted that the Trip Planner is a
joint project between Customer Care and IT.

Director Francone asked staff to comment on the new
features, including the ability to add more than one stop to the
trip. Will Adams noted that this Trip Planner would have more
functionality than the current one. Customer Care and the
public will have access to the same information, as opposed to
the current system where customer care and the public are
working on two separate platforms. Other functionalities
include improved walking distances, removing stops or routes,
avoiding rail, and multiple trips. Director Francone asked when
the Trip Planner would be live. Ashley Rice replied that the
project will kick off the week of January 10th, 2016 and will
be fully completed by the end of December, 2016.
Director Tobiassen asked staff to confirm that staff would be
testing the Trip Planner for ADA compliance. Will Adams
confirmed that would absolutely be the case. Director
Tobiassen wondered where the Trip Planner would be hosted
and if Sheri Le, Cyber Security Manager, is involved in the
process. Ashley Rice replied that it will be hosted on RTD’s
server and that Sheri Le is part of the Technology Review
Panel working on the project.
Chair Sisk shared his excitement in providing a Trip Planner
that works for the constituents. He asked for more
information on Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS). Ashley Rice
explained that RTD has done business previously with CS in
other areas. She noted that they have always delivered. She
added that CS has over 3 years of trip planner experience and
have completed 6 deployments for Florida, New York, Seattle,
Atlanta, Pennsylvania and Virginia. She added that CS has
real time experience and is one of the leading participants in
real time collaboration and research.
Director Hoy mentioned that these kinds of projects, at times,
drag on and that staff has an opportunity to shine with the
December, 2016 deadline. He wondered how the Trip Planner
will work from a phone/mobile device regardless of its
operating system as most people accessing the Trip Planner
will be on a curb waiting for a bus. Dan Jackson noted that
CS developed the mobile interfaces for New York and Trimet
in Portland. Will Adams added that the contract includes
responsiveness regardless of device. Ashley Rice further
explained that the contract calls for the Trip Planner to follow
RTD’s current web design, which automatically recognizes and
adjusts to the device used to access the website. Scott Reed
noted that RTD has been tracking how people access the

agency’s website and currently the majority use mobile
devices. Staff only expects that trend to continue. The Trip
Planner will be a seamless integration of this process.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Updates

 FTA Safety Update (no back-up)
Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, explained that the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA) has established a variety of new rules for safety
and State of Good Repair. The FTA is linking these two items closely in the
new rules. RTD does not see any new rules that could pose significant
challenges locally. RTD is in compliance with all the new rules, and in some
instances, exceeding the safety and State of Good Repair rules as RTD just
considers these good industry practices.
Dave Genova noted that under the MAP-21’s new safety management plan
approach, the Board will have to approve the safety program every year.
This will translate to more safety and technical briefings during committee
meetings in order for the Directors to feel comfortable making these types of
decisions.
He added that currently the FTA oversees safety through the State
Oversight Safety Program. The FTA is making this program more robust.
This will include a new Safety Certification Training Program, which means
that staff doing safety related work will have to undertake certain training
courses. Dave Genova noted that most staff is up to date with these
courses except for one, which is new.
He pointed out that the FTA’s rule making process was started under the
current administration, so the expectation is that the process will be finalized
by the end of 2016. Overall, Dave Genova noted that there is nothing of
significant concern for RTD under these new rules.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, said that she has not seen the mandates as far
as how the agencies are to use these new rules. However, she noted that
the FTA is moving towards a Performance Based Goal Evaluation, which she

funds under these rules. These may include bills, changes in Metropolitan
Planning Organizations (MPOs) structures, grant structures, etc.
Committee Chair Anderson expressed her concerns about MPOs possibly
being in charge of how the funding may be distributed. She wondered if
RTD should try to have more representation at the Denver Regional Council
of Government (DRCOG) Board if they would be making rules for the
agency.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, and Jessie
Carter, Manager for Service Planning and Scheduling, reviewed an
abbreviated version of the City and County of Denver’s (Denver)
presentation titled “The Mall Experience”. The complete version was
included in the Operations and Customer Service Committee agenda packet
for December 8, 2015. Staff distributed a copy of the abbreviated version
to the Directors. A copy of the abbreviated version is available at the Board
Office. The abbreviated presentation included the current state and
traffic/visitations on the 16th Street Mall, observations and analysis, the 8
principles to guide the process, next steps, findings of the Meet In the
Streets events, and lessons learned. He noted that this item was originally
scheduled for discussion during the November Study Session which, due to
scheduling, was cancelled.
Bruce Abel recognized the following people in attendance:
 Brad Buchanan, Director for Community Planning and Development,
Denver
 David Gasper, Senior City Planner, Denver
 Jason Whitlock, Principal City Planner for Urban Design, Denver
 John Desmond, Executive Vice President of Downtown Environment
for the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP)
Bruce Abel expressed his appreciation for the partnership with Denver and
DDP. He highlighted that RTD is the provider of mobility for the 16th Street
Mall. He mentioned that RTD continues to have dialogue with all the
partners on the roles played and the challenges ahead.
Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Directors that this in an information
item with no action from the Board. This proposal will go out to the public
with the 2016 April changes for public comments. Committee Chair
Anderson emphasized that RTD’s main job is transit. She added that an
important piece is to listen to riders that use the 16th Street Mall Ride and
come back to the Board with the April Service changes. She wondered if
there really were more people because there was no bus. She also
wondered how Denver could attract people when there is bus service.

• 16th Street Mall Update

6.D

Director Folska asked staff to remind the Directors of the 16th Street Mall
ridership. Bruce Abel noted that it is 45,000 on weekdays, 25,000 on
Saturdays and 18,000 on Sundays. Director Folska shared that her concern
is the ongoing cost to market the Meet In the Streets weekends. She said
that at a recent event she had the opportunity to talk to over 70 of her
constituents, as well as The Honorable Paul Rosenthal, Representative for
Denver District 9, and The Honorable Pat Steadman, Senator for District 31.
She noted that no one was against the idea of detouring the 16th Street Mall
Ride during the weekends in the summer; however, there was opposition to
detouring the 16th Street Mall Ride during weekdays. She pointed out that
the Mall Ride is the equivalent of a horizontal elevator. She wondered if the
length of the 16th Street Mall has an impact on people lingering on the 16th
Street Mall. Bruce Abel replied that the 16th Street Mall is over a mile long.
He noted that Denver’s experimentation process is designed to figure out
these logistics. He added that about 8 blocks of the 16th Street Mall have a
median and these are the areas that Denver is experimenting with to
measure different types of activities.
Director James thanked John Desmond and Brad Buchanan for their
attendance at the meeting and allowing RTD to collaborate with Denver.
Director James reminded the Directors that the 16th Street Mall Ride was
created in part because the buses were filling up the streets of downtown.
He agrees that RTD’s job is to move people. He believes it is appropriate to
meet with our partners in Denver in order to create the best environment.
He recalled that when he started as a Director 7 years ago he found himself
as Co-Chair of the 16th Street Steering Committee. The goal then was to
attempt to do what is happening now, but it did not go very far. He
mentioned that he is glad to see the experimentation going on with DDP and
Denver’s involvement. He said that he would strongly support anything that
RTD could do to support our partners in a cost-effective manner. He
believes it is interesting how the 16th Street Mall Ride serves as the heart of
the system that extends to the suburbs.
Director Lasater shared his personal observations during one of his visits
downtown on a Meet In the Streets Sunday. He said that there was a lot of
confusion as the vehicles used on 15th Street and 17th Street to transport
people were the Free Metro Ride shuttles. People did not have the
landmarks they are used to on the 16th Street Mall to know where to get off
the shuttle. He noted that one of the conclusions of the presentation was
that women and children felt safer coming downtown during Meet In The
Streets. He said that while he was downtown with his friends, there was a
lot of panhandling and vagabonds, and that the women in his group only felt
safe because their husbands were with them. He said that in order to
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel added that there is further conversation on specifics under the
next agenda item.

6.D

attract more people to Downtown Denver, more needs to be done about the
vagabonds and the herds of teenagers. He also noted that not having the
16th Street Mall Ride shuttle would be a detriment because that is what
people are used to.

Director Francone wondered what the focus of the 16th Street Mall
revitalization is: reenergize the area, leisure, business, etc. She echoed the
sentiment that RTD’s focus is moving people and that any participation in
this partnership should be done in a cost effective manner. She also visited
the 16th Street Mall during a Meet In the Street event and witnessed the
confusion of not having the 16th Street Mall Ride running on 16th Street.
She asked staff to provide, off line, the cost differential between running the
Mall Ride on 16th Street versus on 15th and 17th Streets.
Director Hoy said that he was a little suspicious of the statistics in the
presentation. He is not sure if there would be this many people on the 16th
Street Mall were it not for the intentional activities during these events. He
agreed that RTD’s focus is moving people. He wondered how adjusting the
16th Street Mall Ride route benefits RTD.

• April 2016 Service Change
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, reminded the
Directors that normally service changes happen in January, May, and
August. The May, 2016 changes have been moved to April, 2016 to
coincide with the opening of the University of Colorado A Line (CU A Line).
He noted that the packet is very light since the CU A Line changes, as well
as the restructuring of bus services around the line, were already approved.
Bruce Abel called the Directors’ attention to a letter from the City and
County of Denver (Denver) asking to divert the 16th Street Mall Ride to 15th
Street and 17th Street for 13 weekends during the summer starting on June
4th and ending on August 28th. He added that this is a large enough request
that it is no longer considered a detour but a service change, thus requiring
Board approval. Staff received today a letter of support from the Downtown
Denver Partnership that will be uploaded to the Operations and Customers
Service Committee agenda packet. He noted that at this time this is not a
recommendation but part of the information to be taken out for public
comment. After considering the public comments, a recommendation will be
brought to the Director’s in January.
Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley clarified that the Free Metro Ride runs during the week, not
the weekend. This would be a differentiation on knowing which buses are
providing what service. He said that he would like to see the numbers on
how many people outside of Denver visited the Meet In The Streets events.
He guesses that the number would be very low as this events are very
different from going to a Rockies game or visiting Denver Union Station.

6.D

Director Walker wondered if the weekend changes would be during the day,
evening, or both. Bruce Abel replied that it would be for the entire service
day. Director Walker said that he was fine with the changes as these types
of changes are part of living in a dense area. He agrees that RTD’s business
is moving people; however, he sees it as moving people where they want to
go when they need to be moved. He noted that part of the lessons learned
process is to step up signage to help people find their way through a city
that is constantly changing.
Director Menten mentioned that one of the proposed eliminations is the
Belmar Call-n-Ride, which is in her District. She noted that she is okay with
this as the ridership is 1.8 per hour when the minimum per RTD service
standards is 3 per hour. She pointed out that currently the subsidy is almost
$58 per rider. She said that she is willing to do the necessary outreach in
her area.
Director Menten noted that Attachment C mentions the cost $126,100 for
the 26 days requested by Denver to divert the 16th Street Mall Ride. Bruce
Abel explained that Attachment C has facts on the 16th Street Mall Ride in
an attempt to communicate the role of the shuttle in our transportation
network. During the 2015 Meet In the Streets events, RTD chose to remain
cost neutral by running the Free Metro Ride less frequently given the larger
capacity of the buses. Street Supervisors were stationed at Denver Union
Station and Civic Center to ensure the buses would meet trains and other
bus routes. Attachment C explains what would happen with an increased
frequency to match the current weekend 16th Street Mall Ride service.
Director Menten noted that the 16th Street merchants reported a slight sales
increase. She wondered as to the potential of RTD seeing some increased
sales tax revenue from this to offset the increase in service. She told staff
that this information could be provided offline.
Director Tobiassen asked staff to do an extra effort to reach out to the
disability community regarding these potential changes to the 16th Street
Mall Ride service. Bruce Abel noted that would be part of the process.
Director Hoy suggested that Denver looked into how Boulder finances most
of their services as they contribute more to their requests. Bruce Abel said
that staff would be willing to bring that up in the conversations.
Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska asked for two items to be presented down the road: the
financial impact on the District for making the Saturday and Sunday
modifications and any unintended security consequences. Bruce Abel noted
that these will be included in the assessment as part of the final
recommendation.

6.D

Director Bagley noted that Denver’s request to expand the rerouting of the
16th Street Mall Ride for 26 days is basically a whole month of service. He
does not think there has been enough research done. He thinks that the
research should be done by RTD in conjunction with Denver. The areas to
be looked into include security, service, marketing, and other alternatives.
He added that this is a good start into looking at how something different
may be done; however, there must be a lot more work to be done for him to
approve rearranging one twelfth of the 16th Street Mall Ride operations.
Committee Chair Anderson suggested testing the same activities with the
16th Street Mall Ride running regular operations and to note what the
difference may be.

• Service Performance 2014 Networked Family of Services
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that
this item is presented in conjunction with the Finance Department. He
introduced Jeff Becker, Senior Manager for Service Development, who was
available to answer any questions. Bruce Abel referred the Directors to the
Service Performance 2014 Networked Family of Services report as included
in the Operations and Customer Service committee agenda packet for
December 8, 2015.
Director Bagley noted that the Access-a-Ride subsidy is $57.30. He
wondered how this number has changed throughout the past 5 years. Bruce
Abel replied that he would have to research the specifics number, but that
the amount has not changed significantly.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee - WIN Update
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, said that she was very
delighted to be updating the Board this evening. She noted that, as the
Board saw during the State of the District presentation during the Operations
and Customer Service Committee Meeting, the WIN program received over
$660K in 2015 from the Federal Transit Authority. She shared that in
addition to the FTA funding, one of RTD and the WIN program’s key
partners, Denver Transit Partners (DTP) and its affiliates, has made an
additional donation to the WIN program for 2016. She stated that DTP has
donated to the WIN program since 2011. Zamy Silva pointed out that even
though there was no WIN goal as part of DTP’s contract with RTD they have
voluntarily worked with RTD to hire WIN participants. She explained that
the other exciting item is that DTP has signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with RTD to utilize WIN participants for the duration
of operations and maintenance of the Eagle P3 project.

Aaron Epstein thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak this evening.
He said that on behalf of DTP and all their affiliates he wanted to share how
proud they were of the work done within the communities in partnership
with RTD. He shared that when DTP was given the opportunity to
participate in the WIN program they thought it was a great idea. He
commented how impressed he was with the vision of former General
Manager Washington for the WIN program that has been carried on by
Interim General Manager Genova. He noted that DTP and its affiliates have
contributed over $400K since 2011 and have received a lot of benefit from
the program. Aaron Epstein pointed out that DTP’s operations and
maintenance contract with RTD is for 29 years so people being hired from
the WIN program will really be developing long-term careers. He said that
to-date already 33 people have been hired on the operations side and he
expects more will be hired in the future.
Director Archuleta inquired how many people had been hired through the
WIN program to-date and if they were full or part-time employees. Martell
Dyles stated that since 2011 there have been 663 people hired from the
WIN program. He shared that number continues to grow and believes it will
be closer to 700 come January, 2016. He said that he would provide the
Board with the breakdown of full and part-time employees.
Director Anderson asked for information as to the number of people that
have been hired from Adams County. She feels that the WIN program is
very Denver oriented; however, there are many people in Adams County that
could benefit from the WIN program and need jobs. Martell Dyles said he
would provide the Board with that information.
Director Francone echoed Director Anderson’s sentiments. She shared that
she met with Martell Dyles recently and one of the concerns she addressed
with him was that people in Jefferson County need jobs too. She believes
from her conversation with Martell that it is in the works to begin rolling the
program out to other counties soon.
Committee Chair Walker noted that RTD does not just move people, we help
build lives. He believes the WIN program makes a real investment in the
lives of the participants which means a lot more than just giving someone a
job. He thinks this is something that should be recognized. Director Walker
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Martell Dyles, WIN Program Manager, expressed that it was very exciting to
receive additional funding from DTP. He explained that this funding will be a
tremendous asset in addressing the many ancillary needs that might not be
covered by the FTA grant. He asked Aaron Epstein, DTP CEO and Executive
Project Director, to speak more about DTP’s partnership with RTD.

6.E

shared that in October when he attended APTA Annual and Rail~Volution
he was approached by several people about the WIN program. He
commended the work of the WIN team and DTP.
Director Lubow asked if the number of people hired from the WIN program
could be provided for every county. Zamy Silva said that staff would
provide the Board with the complete information. She shared that there
would be a lot of outreach throughout the entire District in the coming year.

Other Matters
Director Archuleta shared that he recently represented RTD at the Denver Union
Station Grand Illumination when it was a warm 17 degrees. He also recently
accepted an award from the U.S. Building Green Council of Colorado for the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility.

B. Recommended Actions

• Proposed 2015 Internal Audit Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be
performed in 2016.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, shared
that this year the Internal Audit Department has received a lot
of input from members of the Board and management;
therefore, the draft audit plan was sent out in November to
allow everyone a chance to provide feedback. She said she
would be happy to answer any questions.
Director Bagley noted that in the audit plan there were several
items that indicated the audit was requested by a Board
Packet Pg. 40

Director Deadwyler was absent.

6.F

Director Menten acknowledged that she was one of the
Directors who had requested certain audits and would be
happy to explain her reasoning. She said that she had
requested an audit of Call-n-Ride, marketing and
communications. She explained that as it relates to Call-nRide, she is wondering how we track if customers are
receiving calls back when they leave a message. As to
marketing and communications, she would like to learn how
an initiative is deemed successful.
Director Francone indicated that she too requested an audit of
the Call-n-Ride because she has not had an outstanding
personal experience with the service and also receives
frequent constituent complaints. With respect to marketing
and communications she also asked for an audit of these areas
as this is a huge dollar item within the 2016 budget. She
wants to see if RTD is making the best use of these dollars
and getting the most bang for our buck.
Director Bagley said he appreciates the comments made by
Directors Menten and Francone but he wants staff to provide
a write up before the December Board Meeting.
Director Anderson commented that she did not request any of
the audits but remembers having similar concerns about the
Call-n-Ride in Arvada several years ago. She would often hear
from customers who had called for service but never received
a call back. It turned out the driver was hiding.
Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that he is generally the
requestor of the cyber security audit as he feels this is a very
important area. He suggested that the Board look at auditing
as an information gathering tool that is a very thorough, yearlong process. He encouraged the Board to consider the audits
they would like to see whenever practical, but it is important
to remember that an audit cannot get into the queue mid-year.
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop explained that when the Internal Audit
Department receives requests from individual Directors or
management, those audits are only included in the audit plan if
they are viable audits. She pointed that Access-a-Ride and
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

member. He asked to know the name of the Board member
that requested an audit and why that specific audit was
requested. He requested this be added to the audit plan prior
to the December Board Meeting.

6.F

Call-n-Ride were audit items that came out of the State audit;
however, questions that came from the Board could be
accommodated in the audit that was planned.

Report was included in the December 8, 2015 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Agenda Packet. She asked Jannette Scarpino, Senior
Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, to review the highlights.
Jannette Scarpino explained that the report covers the Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) for the first nine months of 2015. She said that
performance was slightly weaker from the 2nd quarter but overall stable.
She shared that while First Transit Commerce City was the only carrier not
to meet the goal related to passenger accidents, all accidents were nonpreventable. She noted that system-wide on-time performance was not as
good as it was in the 2nd quarter but it was still more favorable when
compared with 2014. Jannette Scarpino pointed out that ridership is below
goal but staff is researching why these figures are negative. She expressed
that related to bus operator/mechanic recruitment, RTD was below goal but
staff is working hard to address the vacancies.
Director Lubow indicated her questions and comments came from
information in the 3rd Quarter Performance Report as well as the 3rd Quarter
Reports included in the December 8, 2015 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet. She expressed her support for changing the
subscription policy for Call-n-Ride services. She thinks that it is good to
have the subscriptions terminate to give other people an opportunity to

Director Bagley reiterated that he does not have any problems
with the requested audit topics but knowing who requested
the audit makes him think more deeply about it.

6.F

Director Lubow noted that staff reported that an advocate had begun
educating people how to use the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride, which has
helped increase ridership. She wondered if perhaps the Citizens Advisory
Committee (CAC) members could be trained as advocates. Bruce Abel,
Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that the CAC had not
been used in that capacity to-date. Brian Matthews, Manager of Special
Services, explained that the advocate was a user of the Call-n-Ride who was
concerned about the service being cancelled. She works at an assisted
living facility and began teaching the seniors how to ride. Director Lubow
thought that perhaps finding volunteers to be advocates might be a good
thing to try for other Call-n-Rides that are struggling.
Director Lubow pointed out that ridership for Access-a-Cab decreased in the
3rd quarter. She thought that the goal was for Access-a-Cab ridership to
increase as opposed to Access-a-Ride as the cost is very different to RTD.
Bruce Abel explained that staff pointed this out as it was a change from
what had been the ongoing trend. He said it is not bad so long as
customers continue to get the services they need.
Director Lubow commented that there have been many no shows for the
Access-a-Cab service. She stated that if there is a no show from Access-aCab and the rider cannot walk anywhere it can be very devastating. Larry
Buter, Manager of Paratransit Services, said that staff continues to work
with the cab companies. The reality is that there are many cab drivers who
will not do a trip once they learn it is an Access-a-Cab trip. He explained
that RTD is working with the cab companies to try and motivate the drivers,
who are independent contractors, but it continues to be an ongoing struggle.
Director Lubow asked if there was any back-up service if Access-a-Cab was
a no-show. Larry Buter stated that if it was a return trip RTD would send an
Access-a-Ride vehicle.
Director Lubow noted that there were a lot of red performance figures for
First Transit Commerce City in the 3rd Quarter Performance Report. She
asked if this was a contractor that consistently has problems. Bruce Abel
reiterated that while First Transit Commerce City was red for passenger
accidents, it was determined that they were all non-preventable. He shared
that in recent months they had also been suffering the greatest from staff
shortages.
Director Francone asked staff to provide her with additional information
offline about the Evergreen Call-n-Ride not having the ability to schedule
trips online.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

make a subscription. She asked that staff ensure everyone knows of this
change in policy.

6.F

Director Folska commented that the Board recently received an email from
Douglas Howey related to ADA. She wondered if Larry Buter concurred
with Mr. Howey’s requests/comments. Larry Buter indicated he had not had
the chance to review the email as it came in late in the afternoon. He said
he would reserve comments until he had the chance to fully review the
email. Director Folska asked that he get back to the Board with his
thoughts.

Heather Copp noted that the October Monthly Financial Status Report was
included in the December 8, 2015 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet. She explained that the Sales and Use Tax
figures were estimated in the packet. Since that time staff has received the
actual figures, which unfortunately indicated the estimates were too
optimistic. She said that currently Sales and Use Tax is about $8.5 million
under budget; however, it appears there will be enough funds in the
operating budget to cover the shortfall but staff will continue to monitor
expenditures. She explained that due to the low figures staff is evaluating
whether there should already be an adjustment to next year’s forecast.
Doug MacLeod, Controller, shared that staff had placed a call to the
Department of Revenue because they were surprised that the Sales and Use
Tax was down so much. He said that staff wanted to make sure there were
no anomalies. Heather Copp noted that there could have been a cause like a
large audit that resulted in an assessment for RTD.
Director Folska said she did not have all the details but recently heard that
the State of Colorado is purchasing new software to audit Sales Tax
revenue. She wondered if perhaps this transition might be the cause of the
low Sales and Use Tax revenues. Heather Copp stated she was not aware
of any new software as a new tax system was implemented only two years
ago. She said she did not think that would be the cause of the low Sales
and Use Tax revenues.
Director Hoy shared that the information we receive from the State related
to Sales and Use Tax has always troubled him as it seems like smoke and
mirrors. He expressed that it does give him some comfort that Ms. Copp
used to work for the State so she knows how they operate. Heather Copp
explained that all taxpayer information is confidential; no entity outside of
the State receives that information. She said that staff will always look into
the Sales and Use Tax when there is an unexpected dip with the State.
Director Lubow asked if staff would keep the Board informed as to any
information they learned from the State. Heather Copp said they would
absolutely keep the Board informed.

• Monthly Financial Status October 2015

6.F

Director Bagley asked that the Board be provided with an updated Monthly
Financial Status Report for October prior to the December Board Meeting.
Doug MacLeod stated it would be updated in the packet.
Chair Sisk noted that the drop in ridership is alarming. He wonders if this is
a national trend or something that is unique to RTD. He asked if staff could
look into this. He also wonders at what point the Board needs to take
action.

Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop noted that the 3rd Quarter Internal Audit Report was
included in the December 8, 2015 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet. She asked if there were any questions.
Director Bagley inquired if there were any findings from the audits that
concerned Ms. Isaac-Heslop. Anne Marie Isaac-Heslop stated she had no
concerns but if she did, she would bring them to the Board’s attention
immediately. She commented that Interim General Manager Genova and the
Assistant General Managers have been very rapid in their responses to the
recommendations. She believes RTD is in a good place.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status
Heather Copp pointed out that this will be the last official Smart Media
Technology Update before the public pilot program launches in January.
She expressed her appreciation to everyone who participated in the internal
pilot programs. She said at this time it appears there will be a good mix of
customers for the public pilot program between full fare and discount fare
and also the sales outlets the customers will be using. As was indicated in
the report, there will be several major decision points during the first three
months and the Senior Leadership team will meet weekly.
Heather Copp noted that under program components the external hosting is
still yellow. She said that staff will be making a decision soon if this aspect
of the Smart Media Technology should be deferred as it does not need to be
brought up until there is a public facing portal. She stated that staff does
not want to have too many things occurring during the go-live period for the
public pilot program. She shared that everything is ready for the new fare
structure to be implemented January 1st as well as everything being installed
for the Day Pass printers. She highlighted that the rider experience is still in
yellow as staff needs to continue to work on messaging and managing the
expectations of what the cards can do. The handheld smart media readers
changed from yellow to green as the contract for iPhones was approved and
staff has received a commitment from Xerox to upgrade the Smart Card
portion of the platform.

• Third Quarter 2015 Internal Audit Report

6.F

Director Folska recognized this was a complicated process that has been
addressed in phases; however, she wondered when it became a public pilot
program. She thought that the plan had been to go-live to the full public on
January 1st. It was her understanding that was why there was such a rush
to get the Day Pass printers. Heather Copp explained that the Day Pass
printers were not needed for the Smart Card implementation but for the new
fare structure. She stated that those would be live on January 1st. She
indicated that the plan for Smart Cards had been a public pilot ever since
she has been with RTD. The goal is to limit exposure so RTD can get
customer feedback on every aspect of the program and manage
expectations.
George Hovey explained that King Soopers has always been one of the
primary Retail Point of Sale (RPOS) providers. Unfortunately we were not
able to install the RPOS machines prior to the holiday due to a moratorium
King Soopers has between Christmas and the Super Bowl. It would be
difficult to open the Smart Cards to the full public when someone can only
buy and reload cards at RTD sales outlets. He said that without a more
robust sales network staff thought it appropriate to do a phased approach.
Director Folska asked if the moratorium was something staff had recently
learned about. George Hovey stated that was something that has been
known since we started discussions with King Soopers. He explained that
staff tried to expedite the agreement for an October launch but it was not
possible.
Director Folska shared that she has recently seen commercials advertising
that Xerox does transit better than anyone. She thinks that if they really do
transit that well then perhaps they can do some messaging with RTD being
the testimonial since we are the number one transit agency in the country.
Director Tobiassen wondered if King Soopers charged RTD for being a retail
outlet. Heather Copp stated that we would be paying 1.25%, which is far
less than the average merchant fee, on all transitions (cash and credit/debit
card).
Director Tobiassen asked if paper media would be available until the Smart
Cards were fully implemented. Heather Copp stated that was correct. She
noted there were some concerns about people not being able to receive the
Smart Card discount using paper media; therefore, the decision was made to
Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 8, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp stated she feels comfortable about the January 1st public pilot
program. George Hovey, Program Management Office Manager, expressed
that the testing to-date has been very successful. Xerox has been very
responsive in addressing any issues. He said he is very optimistic for
making the January 1st deadline.

keep the paper media until RTD has a sufficiently robust system. She said
that the Board would be informed prior to the elimination of paper media.

Recommended Actions
2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award
It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option
to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance
through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually
between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board
of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to
exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been
reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist
and no additional positions for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has
reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to
the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
Chair Sisk explained this item is on the agenda due to the changes with the Virtegic
contract since Joni Goheen had submitted her resignation. The Board report has changed

Motion:

Director Walker made the motion to approve the
amended Virtegic Board report to take to the full Board.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Hoy explained that the changes in the Board
report included reducing the Joni headcount and not
moving the two part-time positions to full-time. IGM
Genova added that the team has renegotiated the
scope with Virtegic and this is the new agreement.
Director Bagley inquired of IGM Genova how does this
reduction in headcount given the 2016 rollout impact
the Agency and if we will be sufficiently staffed? IGM
Genova stated that staff was comfortable with the
changes. Marta Spieki will be moving into Joni’s role
and she has a breadth and knowledge that will be
helpful.
Director Walker expressed that he hopes there is no
missteps during the rollouts but if one occurs, because
of this decision to reduce headcount, the Board will
recognize that we put our customers in risk in terms of
providing information in a timely manner. Director
Bagley noted this was poignantly stated and requested
Director Walker to make these statements in the Board
meeting on December 15.
Director Hoy added that he has worked with Marta and
she is a dynamo. She will be good in this role.
Director Tobiassen agreed with the statements made by
Director Walker. He stated that Virtegic also has a new
person with much depth who will be stepping up to the
plate.
Chair Sisk indicated that he has been having
conversations with Virtegic and communications. It is
unfortunate that this was personal and people took
personal hits. He does not like to see anyone get hurt.
He thinks this is a good solution and he will support
this action.

December Board Meeting Agenda Review
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to move the full agenda
with corrections noted forward to the December 15
Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten inquired how the motion to take from
the table on the Virtegic contract will work. Paula
Perdue explained that the motion that the Executive
Committee approved becomes a substitute motion. At
the Board meeting, a motion will be made to take the
contract from the table. Someone will need to
substitute the motion with the new motion. Assuming
the action to take from the table passes, they will
resume their normal discussions on this action.
Amendments and other changes may be made as
recommended and voted upon.
Director Francone offered to make the substitute
motion since she was the one to request tabling the
action in the last Board meeting.
Director Bagley requested IGM Genova to give him the
votes on each of the recommended actions.
The committee noted two errors on the agenda: The
proposed 2015 internal audit plan did not pass as
unanimous as indicated and the Award of Evergreen
Call-n-Ride contract should have been on unanimous
consent. Paula Perdue acknowledged the errors and
stated her staff would make proper corrections.

Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the
Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract with the Seniors’ Resource Center for the provision of the
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” contracted demand response transit services. This
contract is for three years with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount
includes $1,597,481 for service for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel
for the first three years for a total amount not to exceed $1,696,698 for the
first three years. The contract amount also includes two (2) one-year options in
the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel for a total of
$599,262 for option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for fuel for
a total of $616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five
year period is not to exceed $2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a
total of $2,912,935. These costs are based on an hourly rate and include
estimated fuel costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will
reimburse the Contractor’s actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the
most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for
Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public
Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to
begin January 1, 2016.

Retiree Awards
Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, mentioned that Mike Gil, Deputy
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, was not able to attend the meeting. He
noted that he does not know what RTD would have done without Mike Gil’s years of
service and commitment. He was aware of everything going on in Bus Operations and
even Rail Operations. IGM Genova added that Mike Gil will serve in an adjunct capacity
during the transition period as new leaders are developed. He said that Mike Gil is a
fixture at RTD and he will be greatly missed.
IGM Genova reminded the Directors that Gina Callahan will serve as the Acting Deputy
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations.

Public Participation

Terry Liggins, Denver, spoke in appreciation of RTD staff and the Board for the new
adjustments to the Montbello proposed routes which now provides access to the
only grocery store in the neighborhood. She added that she still has concerns
about the Montbello Park-n-Ride going away; however, she understands the
reasoning behind this as the A line opens. She noted that there needs to be more
discussion on the distance between the routes.
Khadija Haynes, Denver, thanked the Directors for reaching out and having
conversations with the Montbello community. She said she appreciated the effort
in making the changes presented that evening. She noted that RTD may think that
it has been communicating with the community, yet the majority of riders are not

aware of the upcoming changes. The Montbello Organizing Committee stepped in
to help communicate the changes. She said the Montbello Organizing Committee is
interested in working with RTD to aid in the communication piece with the
community.
Mayra Gonzales, Denver, spoke on behalf of the Montbello Organizing Committee.
Over the past 6 months she has been gathering community input on transit in the
neighborhood. She said she quickly found out that people do not know what is
going on. She acknowledged the proposed changes in order to improve access to
the grocery store; however, these changes do not address Park-n-Ride concerns.
She noted that the Peoria Street and Albrook Drive intersection is a heavily
trafficked area and unsafe as the sidewalks are not accessible to those with
mobility devices. She asked RTD to work with the City and County of Denver to
address these issues.
Angelle Fouther, Denver, shared that her husband, Rev. James Fouther, is the
pastor of the United Church of Montbello and that they live in the church’s home.
She serves as the Interim Chair of the Montbello Organizing Committee, which she
helped organized. She thanked the Directors for the opportunity to speak to them.
She also thanked the Directors and Staff for listening, taking the time to go through
the neighborhood and making changes. She underscored the issue of
communication as many people in her community do not know what is going on
when it comes to transit changes. She noted that in a community that is transit
dependent, this lack of communication could be detrimental as people could lose
jobs. She offered the Montbello Organizing Committee as a channel to
communicate changes, processes, and impact.
Mary Yoakaum, Denver, spoke in favor of keeping Route 28 in service. She
understood that ridership is not what it should be and that service may have to be
scaled back. She shared that she has Turner Syndrome, which makes her very
sensitive to cold weather. She noted that one of the reasons why she bought her
house was because it was in front of a bus stop, thus limiting her exposure to the
cold.
Jaime Lewis, Denver, mentioned that he works for the Colorado Cross Disability
Coalition (CCDC). He has worked with Dace West from Mile High Connects in the
past year on the income based fares. He shared that he has received a lot of
feedback from the residents of Montbello due to the proposed changes. He stated
that CCDC concurs with many of the concerns brought forth by the residents of
Montbello, City Councilwoman Stacy Gilmore, Walmart store manager Shelly
Trujillo, and other concerned citizens. He noted that many Montbello residents use
buses for education, employment, access to the grocery store, and maintaining
independence. He recognized that RTD staff has made attempts to communicate
the proposed changes with the community. Jaime Lewis said that CCDC requests
that the changes be postponed until additional outreach, a 6 month impact study,

and a sidewalk audit are performed. He mentioned the unique qualities of the
Montbello community: only one major food provider, no regular high schools, and
disabled people having to walk over half a mile to reach the proposed bus stops.
He noticed Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, addressing a
group of Montbello residents, in which there were as many questions as there were
answers.
Hinton Roberson, Denver, shared that he is a bus operator for RTD and used to
drive Route 153. He said that he liked the revised proposal presented to the
Montbello community before the meeting. He noted that there are still some needs
to be addressed, like riders’ security in the area, the Montbello Park-n-Ride, and
ADA accessibility. He said that he would like to continue attending Board meetings
to learn about what is going on at RTD and would be willing to drive a bus with
members of the Montbello community to the meetings so they would be informed
as well. He added that he is an ex-police officer from Baltimore and he has been
featured on the Denver Post, 5280, and Travel Channel for his work with RTD.
Chair Sisk thanked Hinton Roberson for his service to RTD and for coming out to
speak to the Directors.
Reverend James Fouther, Denver, noted that his wife spoke very well on both of
their behalf. He mentioned that the Montbello Organizing Committee has done a
great job laying out and advocating for the issues. He added that they are grateful
for the changes presented.
Damion Hughes, Denver, spoke in favor of keeping Route 28. He understands that
the revised changes call for weekday service and no weekend service instead of
cancelling the route all together. He thanked RTD for that decision. He noted that
many vulnerable people depend on Route 28. He added that there are opportunities
for ridership as new development is in the works. He pointed out this would be a
great opportunity to reach out to people transitioning in to the neighborhood, such
as people that perhaps may have a negative connotation on transit, and share the
convenience of using Route 28 in light of parking downtown.
Doug Gragg, Denver, complimented RTD on one of the agency’s employees. Doug
Gragg said that he had a conversation with this employee while people watching at
Union Station. It was clear from the conversation that the employee was very well
educated, knew what he was talking about, and had the interest of the agency at
heart. He gave the employee’s business card to Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy
Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, and suggested that the employee
receive a commendation. Doug Gragg noted that for the past three (3) Sundays
with Broncos games, the validating machines were not working at Union Station,
causing a revenue loss. He said that this problem creates greater confusion on
already jammed packed days. He asked staff to fix this.
Shanta Farrington, Aurora, spoke on behalf of FRESC Good Jobs Strong
Community. She noted that Westminster has two major developments in process:

the light rail and the new shopping mall. FRESC has been reaching out to the
community, faith leaders, and business owners. Small business owners have
expressed concerns on the fare hike without an income based structure in place.
She added that due to the rising costs of health care and just the unknowns of life,
business owners are worried about how employees will get to and from work. She
encouraged the Board to reconsider how to incorporate a low fare program into the
current budget in order to allow an equitable factor in the decision making process.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, thanked the Board members who voted for the
implementation of the non-profit program: Tobiassen, Solano, Sisk, Lasater, Folska,
Lubow, Deadwyler, Archuleta, and Anderson. She thanked Directors Archuleta,
Folska, Lubow, Solano, and Tobiassen for their outspoken support. She said that
she is speaking tonight because she sees no firm commitment from RTD to an
income based program. She asked RTD to make a firm commitment because she
feels advocates for this type of program are being pushed back. As a 9to5
Community Organizer, she has had no progress to report to the community. She
shared her happiness over the changes to the Montbello service. She stressed that
the Montbello Park-n-Ride is an important community hub. She encouraged the
Directors to take more time to listen to the community and to not make rash
decisions.
Brad Martin, Aurora, spoke on the light rail construction at Aurora Town Center.
He lives on the north end of the construction and finds it difficult zig zagging
through all the traffic. Due to his disability, it is painful for him to drive through it.
He noted that businesses along Exposition have been impacted, including the
Walmart, which has taken a $4 million hit. The construction is also tearing into the
parking area of various apartment complexes, affecting the neighborhood as well.
Dana Nobles, Denver, recognized that the Board is taking small steps to address the
human cost that the changes in fare and routes incur. She congratulated the Board
members who voted in favor of expanding the non-profit program and encouraged
the Directors to keep moving in that direction. She echoed the sentiment of having
transparent community impact statements for new changes. She pointed out that
the non-profit program will not reach the 68% of low income riders impacted by
the fare increase and the reduction of bus lines. She said she was happy to hear
some of those reductions were being mitigated. She pointed out that as a city and
a community we can do better. She pointed out that prioritizing an income
program, like Seattle did, starts mitigating the human cost. She mentioned that the
majority of riders are low income, and as constituents they deserve to be invested
in. Dana Nobles shared that the ripple effects of an income based programs on
people making strides towards economic security and self-sufficiency are
monumental. She noted that the Board has heard for the past three (3) years that
the community has been asking for a program that addresses the needs of those
who depend on public transit. She said that she is not going away until RTD gives

its best, which means more than listening. It means action and prioritizing human
beings, communities, and their needs.
 Bryce Matthews, Parker, spoke to the letter from the Mayor of the Town of Parker
(Parker) included in the Board meeting agenda packet. He noted that he is the
Comprehensive Planning Manager for Parker. He pointed out that Parker is
appreciative of RTD’s consideration of the town’s connection to the District’s
system. Parker supports the proposed Route 483, which will replace Routes 410
and 153. This route speaks to the town’s desire of full day service and
connectivity to the 9 Mile Station. However, he mentioned that the proposed
schedule will lose local bus service from 20 Mile Road to the Pinery Park-n-Ride.
This loss will have an impact on those depending on Access-a-Ride as well as the
projected growth. Parker would encourage RTD to seek ways to maintain services
to the Pinery Park-n-Ride as well as increasing the frequency of the north leg of
Route 483 to 30 minutes. He said that this change could happen after the opening
of the R Line since many people will be dependent on that line for commuting.
Parker would also encourage RTD to continue the conversation to expand service to
the weekends. He thanked RTD and Director Lasater for all their work and asked
the Board to approve Route 483 with the requested improvements.
 Elizabeth Murphy, Commerce City, spoke to the 3 upcoming FasTracks stations in
South Adams County. She said the community is excited about the possibilities;
however, if they cannot access the stations they will not be able to benefit from
the new development. She thanked the Directors who supported the non-profit
program and asked for further steps towards affordable transit. She added that the
fare increases in 2016 will create further barriers in areas where people already
have barriers to transit. She asked RTD to create a plan of how to incorporate
income based passes into the budget.
Chair Sisk thanked all the public participants for their remarks.

transition plan provided by Dave Genova in May 2015. This transition plan includes seven
(7) goal areas he thought are necessary to work on during the remainder of his term.

legislature while being polished and professional. She noted that Henry Stopplecamp,

FRONT Summit. She thanked staff for their ability to present clearly and field nasty
questions from the audience.

Discussion:

Director Lubow shared that although she appreciates
the work that goes into preparing the budget, she will
be voting no because she would like to stress the need
to prioritize money for a low income fare given the
reduced cost of fuel and other items.
Director Folska echoed Director Lubow’s thoughts. She
would like to see a line item for the low income fare,
even if that would require the Board to balance the
budget. She said the Directors would have to find
money from somewhere, like $5 million from marketing,
to support the low income fare program.
Director Solano said that he will be voting no because
he thinks there needs to be an allocation for the needy.
He acknowledged that this may make the process
longer; however, as a public entity RTD needs to do so.

XIV. Recommended Action
University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail 2016 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan
package as summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately
$16,948,000, exclusive of University of Colorado A Line Operating and Maintenance
costs, and further, to authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action made by staff,
Chair Sisk called on Director Deadwyler. Director Deadwyler made an amendment to the
main motion.
Motion to
Amend the
Main Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to amend the
recommended action concerning the University of
Colorado A and R Line and Rail 2016 Service Changes
Plan, replacing the Montbello Service Plan contained in
the recommended action with the Montbello Final
Recommendation and map dated November 17, 2015.
This revised plan contains modifications to Routes 45
and 121 allowing better access to existing points of
interest in the neighborhood, especially improving
access to area grocery store.
Director Menten seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus
Operations, thanked the Directors for the opportunity to
present the rationale to the service changes in the
Montbello neighborhood. After the committee
meetings, staff continued conversations and analysis
with the community and Director Deadwyler. The
primary issue was access to the Walmart Neighborhood
Grocery at Chambers and Gateway, which is the main
grocery facility in the neighborhood. This
recommendation basically flips the east legs of Routes
45 and 121 as originally presented to the Directors.
These changes will improve access from all directions

to the Walmart Neighborhood Grocery via Routes 121
and 45. Route 45 will also provide access to the Super
Walmart at Tower and Salida and the King Soopers at
Tower and Green Valley Ranch Boulevard. Route 42
will also provide access to the Super Walmart.
Director Folska thanked staff for their responsiveness
and commitment to the constituents. She also thanked
Director Deadwyler for ensuring her constituents were
heard. She wondered what the cost of implementing
these changes would be. Bruce Abel replied that staff
estimates that these changes would require an extra
bus for a cost of $150,000 to $160,000 annualized.
Director Menten asked what funding could be used to
cover this cost. Bruce Abel replied that the 2016
budget includes a line item for system maintenance.
Director Menten thanked Bruce Abel, Jessie Carter,
Manager for Service Planning and Scheduling, Jeff
Dunning, Senior Service Planner/Scheduler for the East
Team, and Director Deadwyler for their work on these
changes. She recalled the challenges of the service
changes during the opening of the West rail line.
Director Anderson acknowledged that many of the
complaints from the community during public
participation are not RTD related. She encouraged the
community to work with the City and County of Denver
(Denver) for sidewalks and lighting improvements. She
noted that the community has Councilwoman Gilmore
on their side. Bruce Abel shared that staff has met
with Councilwoman Gilmore on this subject.
Director Deadwyler agreed with Director Anderson.
She encouraged the citizens of Montbello to work with
Denver for further neighborhood improvements. She
acknowledged that RTD staff would help initiate those
conversations; however, RTD has no authority or
funding for those matters. She thanked staff for all
their hard work, noting that the hardest person they
had to get through was her.

Discussion:

Director Lasater echoed Bryce Matthew’s comments on
behalf of the Town of Parker. He appreciates Jessie
Carter and Jeff Dunning for evaluating the current
Route 410 and recommending the same peak period
frequencies on Route 483 as this will be important for
connectivity even for potential employees that will
work in Parker. He encouraged the Board to discuss at
a later date service from 9 Mile to Parker and service
requests for the weekends. He admonished Parker to
get ahead of the curve and start marketing the Call-nRide service to the potential areas of employment to
get riders to match a potential increased service
request.

2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim
General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated
as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the
period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated
annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of
Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed
$602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been reduced below 2015 levels
with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist and no additional positions for 2016
and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has reduced the budget for the fourth -year 2016
extension by $143,248.32 compared to the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award
are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffing needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s Board adopted goal to Advance/Complete
FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group,
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award, at a rate that was
approximately half that of the previous Public Information Consultant.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or increased from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved three previous option years
through 2015. In the three years of working as the FasTracks public information consultant so far,
the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily performed their work assignments and have remained
flexible in meeting the needs of the public information program during several key staff transitions.
They are also playing a key role in augmenting RTD Public Relations outreach, as FasTracks projects
begin transitioning into base system operational services.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one -year

Packet Pg. 89

14.A

option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 was $686,009.60. The fourth one-year option for 2016 is not to
exceed $602,163.20 bringing the total on this contract to $2,712,108.00. It is crucial that proper
amounts of staff who have direct experience with RTD’s programs, procedures and policies be in
place to provide adequate resources for the unprecedented five rapid transit line openings in 2016,
something with which no other transit agency has ever been tasked.
The FasTracks Public Information Program is implemented through six functional areas: Internal
Relations, Government Relations, Media Relations, Public Involvement, Public Outreach, and Crisis
Communications. The 2016 PIC scope of work is divided into the PI Program’s functional areas.
The 2016 Scope of Work is as follows:

The following basic components are included in the 2016 contract:


The consultant team consists of direct contract project staff including five full -time staff
members and three part-time staff members.



A seven percent Small Business Enterprise (SBE) goal is assigned to this contract.
However, 100 percent of the work effort on this contract is SBE-performed given that
Virtegic is a certified SBE.



Please note that the headcount has been reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination
of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist and no additional positions for 2016 and there is
no increase in hourly rates, which has reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016
extension by $143,248.32 compared to the original fourth-year 2016 proposal.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this fourth and final one-year option are included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for
the FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the fourth and final
one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through
2016. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant staff, and
awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment
is for an amount not to exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016, the final year of the contract.

Packet Pg. 91

14.A

Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program and specific FasTracks design and construction projects, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016. This alternative would
delay and negatively impact the effective implementation of the FasTracks Public Information
Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
fourth and final one-year option to Virtegic Group, Incorporated. Issue another Request for
Proposals for professional services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
for the FasTracks Program and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the Virtegic team is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in
meeting the changing communication needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will
delay and negatively impact the successful implementation of the various strategies and activities
associated with a comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016.

2015 Year End Budget Transfer for Access-aRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the Via
Mobility budgets to the service line item of the Transdev On Demand budget to cover the variation in
costs incurred as a result of the assignment of additional Access-a-Ride service to Transdev On Demand
in 2015. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $686,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, All Aboard Transit, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev On Demand, to provide Access-a-Ride
paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of the service providers (All Aboard, MV,
and Via) operate RTD-owned vehicles to provide the service. These vehicles are “dedicated” to the
provision of Access-a-Ride service. The fourth provider (Transdev On Demand) uses Transdev-owned
vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide the service. These vehicles are not dedicated to the provision of
Access-a-Ride service, but are also used to provide traditional taxi cab service. The current Accessa-Ride contracts were implemented in April of 2014 following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The
current Access-a-Ride service model is a change from the previous service model. Previously, the
service had been provided by four (4) providers (MV Transportation, Global Transportation, Horizon
coach Lines, and Via Mobility Services) all using RTD-provided vehicles.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the three dedicatedvehicle providers (All Aboard, MV and Via) were all planning to hire a portion of the operators that
were employed by Global Transportation. Due to ongoing Union negotiations at the time, the
providers were not able to specify the exact benefits that operators would receive once they
transitioned from Global to a new employer. As a result, a large number of former Global operators
decided to find employment elsewhere. From the onset of the contracts, the three dedicated vehicle
providers struggled to hire sufficient numbers of employees to meet the service demands. Despite
aggressive hiring campaigns, each or the dedicated vehicle service providers continues to request
limitations on the level of service that they are requested to provide. The combination of hiring
challenges due to the low unemployment rate, legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado, and
the ever increasing pattern of traffic congestion, forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center to assign more
and more service to Transdev taxi cab service. It appears that the forces working against the
dedicated vehicle providers being able to hire drivers, has not had the same limiting effect on the cab
industry.
The reliance on Transdev taxi service to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that the dedicated vehicle
providers have been unable to provide has resulted in an increase in the 2015 costs for Transdev and
a decrease in 2015 costs for the dedicated vehicle providers. Consequently, it is necessary to

Packet Pg. 93

15.B

transfer budgeted funds from dedicated vehicle providers budgets to the Transdev budget in order to
pay for service provided through the end of 2015.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Via service and fuel
budgets that can be transferred into the Transdev On Demand service budget.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for
Transdev On Demand service through the end of 2015.
2.

Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Transdev On Demand
service.

Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with the Seniors’
Resource Center for the provision of the “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” contracted demand response transit
services. This contract is for three years with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount
includes $1,597,481 for service for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years
for a total amount not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract amount also
includes two (2) one-year options in the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel for a
total of $599,262 for option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for fuel for a total of
$616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five year period is not to exceed
$2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a total of $2,912,935. These costs are based on an
hourly rate and include estimated fuel costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will
reimburse the Contractor’s actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the most responsive
and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is
scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.
BACKGROUND:
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive, or “Call-n-Ride” service can
be described as shared-ride public transit service provided in a defined service area that requires that
the passenger contact the service provider to arrange for pick-up.
As a supplement to RTD fixed-route service, “Call-n-Ride” service has been operating in Evergreen
since March 2002. This service will continue to supplement and complement existing RTD fixedroute services operating in the area. The service area for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride can generally be
described as the same area as the Evergreen Metropolitan Water District.
Call-n-Ride service will continue to be provided on weekdays from 5:30 AM to 7:00 PM with two
vehicles serving the area. Saturday service will operate 9:00 AM TO 7:00 PM with one vehicle. No
service is offered on Sundays/holidays.

DISCUSSION:
One (1) proposal was received in response to Request For Proposals (RFP) 15DH099 for the provision of
the Evergreen Call-n-Ride demand response service. The proposal was received from the current Call-nRide Contractor, the Seniors’ Resource Center. The limited response to the RFP was primarily due to
two factors: 1) Because of the physical location of Evergreen, it may be impractical for other local
contractors to bid on a service that would require excessive deadhead; and 2) Potential contractors also
feel that it was impractical to try to supervise an Evergreen operation from Denver; locating on-site
operations in Evergreen would most likely be cost prohibitive given this size of the contract. The

Packet Pg. 95

15.C

Seniors’ Resource Center currently provides non-profit transportation services in Evergreen and has an
established operations center in the area.
It is the recommendation of the RTD staff that evaluated the proposal received in response to RFP
15DH099, that RTD award the contract for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride demand response services to the
Seniors’ Resource Center. This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposal according
to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established
for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b)
experience/qualifications (30%); and c) price (35%).
The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services, Pat Heye,
Alternative Service Planner and Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services. The Seniors’ Resource
Center (SRC) has been providing the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service since March 2002. SRC has provided
excellent service to the community as well as to the RTD. After reviewing both the technical and cost
proposals, it was the consensus of the evaluation team that the Seniors’ Resource Center presented an
acceptable proposal and offered a realistic price to provide the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of service under this contract are included in the adopted 2016 RTD budget.
Funds will be requested in future years’ budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to the Seniors’ Resource Center.
2)
Resolicit the provision of the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service.

Authorization to enter into fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics for a new RTD
Trip Planner (15DJ005)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $763,757.00 fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) for design, development, testing, and release of RTD’s new Trip
Planner.
BACKGROUND:
Currently, trip planning is done by individual RTD riders through the RTD website by using a trip planner
powered by Google Transit and also internally by Customer Care agents using outdated TranStar
software. RTD (Customer Care and Marketing) has encountered a number of growing challenges:
 The two current solutions do not allow adequate flexibility to customize planning for a rider’s trip.
As an example, there are very limited means to set acceptable walk distances that meet RTD’s
standards or that properly define potentially hazardous physical boundaries.
 The current trip planners constrain RTD from making desired enhancements and customizations
that are now the standard of the transit industry.
 The two trip planners do not always provide the same itineraries for the same trip request,
resulting in conflicting schedules and routes that confuse would-be passengers.
 The current trip planner limitations result in a significant amount of unnecessary trip planningrelated calls directed to the RTD call center that impact wait times for customers who have other
information needs.
The purpose of this project is to implement a new trip planner that better meets the needs of RTD’s
Riders as well as internal Customer Care department:







To enhance the Trip Planning experience of riders:
o More options to plan trips (enter a stop, etc.)
o Permit users to explore, change, refresh, reverse, email, print, save trip plans etc.

To increase efficiencies and reduce the number of unnecessary trip planning-related calls that
come into the Customer Care call center.
To ensure that riders and Customer Care agents have quick access to the same trip planning
data.
To ensure that the trip planner product is flexible and can be customized and scaled to meet the
changing needs of our riders and RTD as an organization.
To reduce from two to one the number of trip planner tools utilized, funded and managed by
RTD.

DISSCUSSION:
In early 2015, RTD completed an extensive requirements gathering effort with product owners and IT
experts to identify the overall system requirements as well as what requirements could be met out-ofbox versus what requirements would have to be custom-developed.
After a lengthy analysis process, RTD has selected OpenTripPlanner (OTP) as the new trip planning
system for use by both Customer Care employees and our riding public. OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an
Open Source, Multi-Modal Trip Planning System (OS MMTPS) collaboratively developed by a team of
developers from across the globe and coordinated by TriMet, Portland’s transit agency. TriMet’s trip
planner, using Open Trip Planner can be found on their website here: http://trimet.org/.
As an open source product, there are no recurring software licensing costs or the attendant licensing
limitations to RTD. RTD will have access to the source code of the system as well as access to an open
development community. RTD and Cambridge Systematics will contribute back to the developer
community with ideas and new code development (as part of the open-source licensing agreement).
While the Open Trip Planner tool will provide significant, comprehensive functionality out-of-the box, it
will also require customized modifications to meet RTD’s specific and local needs – this development
effort represents a major component of the project’s budget and scope.
RTD’s Information Technology department does not have human resource capacity to develop and
configure the customizations in the timeframe required. Thus, a 3rd party software development service
provider with experience in developing trip planners with open-source products is required. The proposed
contract’s completion is eight months
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of the OpenTripPlanner development, warrant and support is $763,757.00. Funding
for this project is included in the 2015 SBP.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Cambridge
Systematics, Inc. to design, develop, test, and release a single new trip planner system that
meets both the needs of RTD’s riders and RTD Customer Care agents. This is the
recommended action.
2. Continue the use of the existing trip planner tools. This solution does not address RTD rider
needs, will continue to increase demands on Customer Services personnel and requires
ongoing resources and funding to support two separate systems.
3. Advance the development and configuration of the Open Trip Planner utilizing IT resources.
This would significantly delay the delivery of the planner and would require diverting already
busy IT staff from current priority projects.

Subject:

Approval of 2016 Granite Paver Maintenance
Contract Amendment for 16th Street Mall
Transitway Lanes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract
for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end
date from the current end date of July 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract
value by $1,000,000 to a total of $3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016
Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
RTD has maintained the granite pavers on 16th St. Mall Transitway since the mall was constructed in
1982. In 2013 the City and County of Denver committed to participate in the cost of maintenance and
pay RTD 30% of the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an annual maximum of $300,000.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. Gallegos is the current contractor performing
maintenance on the Transitway. Historically, Gallegos has utilized eight employees and material vendors
that supported approximately 10 to 20 jobs for each Work Order (WO). As needed, granite pavers are
purchased from a separate vendor (Cold Spring Granite).
The current maintenance contract was a three year contract that was awarded midyear 2013. This
amendment to extend the end date brings the contract period into alignment with our annual expense
budget. During the initial two years of the contract, the Mall required a greater amount of maintenance
than anticipated, and RTD has expended the total amount anticipated over the full three years of the
contract award. This amendment increases the total contract value to allow for expected activity for the
remainder of the third year of the contract as well as the five month extension to the end of 2016.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The available budget for Mall paver repairs in the 2016 Adopted Budget is $1,000,000, which will cover
the cost of this contract in 2016.

16.E

DBE / SBE GOAL
All work has and will be completed by a single contractor which is self-classified as a Woman Minority
Business Enterprise (WMBE). There was no DBE / SBE Goal established for the original contract.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to amend the contract for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos
Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end date from the current end date of July 31,
2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract value by $1,000,000 to a total of
$3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016 Adopted Budget.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Require a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) be issued for the
next 16th Street Mall Granite Maintenance contract, to be awarded on or before July 31, 2016,
and suspend all Work Orders when contract value funds are exhausted before the current end of
the contract term. This is not recommended as it will result in the deterioration of the mall pavers
with the resulting potential for pedestrian tripping hazards and damage to the mall shuttles,
possibly resulting in the suspension of shuttle service.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts
the attached Resolution which adopts the Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has two policies, Resolution 10, Series of 1984 and Resolution 35, Series of 2002, which
govern the disposition of real property and the joint development of real property. The Board has also
granted authorization for real property transactions under the grants of authority given for the FasTracks
infrastructure projects. As those projects currently under construction come to completion, an updated
policy is needed that provides for a consistent and efficient method of managing RTD’s real property
assets.
DISCUSSION
Staff has presented an overview of the issues and proposed policy as updates in June and August, and
provided a draft of the policy for Board review in November. Minor changes and clarifications have been
made to the November draft and are attached, showing track changes, to this Board report, as
Attachment A.
The proposed resolution repeals the existing resolutions and adopts the attached Policy for Joint
Development and Disposition of Real Property.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The policy identifies process and guidelines for disposition of real property or joint development of real
property, and as such has no financial impact in and of itself. The financial impact of any disposition or
joint development will be considered on a case by case basis as it arises.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action: It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution which adopts the

in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and
operate a regional mass transportation system; and,
WHEREAS: During the course of implementing the regional transit system,
the District has acquired and will in the future acquire various real property
interests for transit related uses; and,

WHEREAS: The District has adopted Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and
Resolution 35, Series of 2002, to govern disposition of real property and joint
development; and,
WHEREAS: The District has grown in size and scale since the adoption of
Resolution 10 in 1984, and a revised policy is needed to allow the District to
efficiently and effectively manage its real property assets.

I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. During the course of
implementing the regional transit system, the District has acquired and will in the future
acquire various real property interests for transit related uses. As the District’s needs change
over time, real property once needed for transit purposes may no longer be needed and may
be disposed of, or may be utilized more efficiently and effectively if combined with transit
supportive uses in a joint development project. This policy replaces prior District policies on
disposition and joint development, including Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and Resolution 35,
Series of 2002, and identifies procedures for authorizing the disposition of excess real property,
or the joint development of District real property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has no current or future transit
interest.
3. Fair Market Value: The price at which property would change hands between a willing
buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell, and both
having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
4. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project
costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
5. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.

POLICY FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY:

6. Project Property: Any real property or improvements included in the costs of an FTA(FTA) guidance.1
7. Permanent Real Property Interest: Fee simple, permanent easement, long-term
leasehold thirty years or more in duration, and/or inclusion in a condominium or
common interest community.
III. Policy:
1. District Initiated Dispositions or Joint Development:
The following procedures apply when the District initiates a disposition of excess property
or a joint development of real property.
a. The General Manager and CEO (“GM”) shall review existing Management
Directives, and establish additional administrative processes and procedures as
necessary to plan for the disposition or joint development of District property,
and to secure FTA concurrence for real property matters, where applicable. The
processes and procedures shall define how fair market value is determined.
b. All property dispositions and/or joint developments shall require Board approval
unless the disposition or joint development meets the delegation of authority
criteria defined in Section III.3 below.
c. For excess real property only, if the property is configured in a way that it cannot
be developed as a stand-alone development due to factors such as its size, shape
or access, and there is a single contiguous property owner with an interest in
acquiring the District property, the District may elect to negotiate directly with
that contiguous property owner.
d. All other joint development and disposition that is initiated by the District shall
be competitively advertised.

development of District Property shall follow the procedures outlined in the Unsolicited
Proposal Policy for Real Property.
3. Delegation of Authority:
a. Any grant or disposition of a permanent real property interest by the District
shall be approved by the RTD Board of Directors, provided however, that the
Board, by adoption of this policy, hereby delegates authority to the GM/CEO to
grant or dispose of the following types of property interests:
i. All access and utility easements over, under, above, across and through
District property, and benefitting District property;
ii. Dedications of Right of Way to local jurisdictions;
iii. Non-permanent grants of property interests including but not limited to
temporary construction easements, licenses, and all leases under 7 years
in duration;
iv. All property interests with a fair market value under the GM’s delegated
contracting authority.2
b. This provision does not preclude the GM from seeking a separate delegation of
authority from the Board for specific projects or circumstances, and does not
modify any prior delegations by the Board.
4. Annual Reporting:
a. The GM/ CEO shall provide an annual report to Board summarizing all
permanent property interests granted to third parties during the prior year,
including location of the property, type of interest granted, and value received.
5. Federal Transit Administration requirements:
a. All Project Property in which there is a federal interest shall follow relevant FTA
requirements before a transfer of that property interest can be completed.
b. If there are conflicts between this policy and any applicable Federal
requirements, the Federal requirements shall govern.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts
the attached Resolution
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has no formal policy that holistically addresses unsolicited proposals for joint development
or unsolicited offers to acquire excess real property. RTD’s unsolicited proposal policy for goods and
services explicitly excludes real property while RTD’s Strategic Plan for Transit Oriented Development
provides general guidance for reviewing unsolicited development proposals, but needs additional
clarifying regarding process for selection of a development partner.
DISCUSSION
Staff has presented an overview of the issues and proposed policy as updates in June and August, and
provided a draft of the policy for Board review in November. During the November update, and in
comments provided to staff, Board Directors have expressed concerns about the sole source criteria
identified in the joint development context, and have asked for some additional process clarifications. A
comparison version showing tracked changes for the proposed changes to the policy is attached as
Attachment A.
As a result of those comments, staff recommends the following modifications to the policy draft
provided in November.
1) For joint development proposals, the District will accept unsolicited proposals, but will
advertise all joint development opportunities competitively. A chart illustrating the unsolicited
joint development proposal review process is attached to the policy.
2) For excess real property, the District may enter into negotiations with a contiguous property
owner without a competitive solicitation when the District property is configured in a way that it
cannot be developed as a stand-alone parcel due to factors such as size, shape, or access.

The proposed resolution repeals Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TOD and adopts the attached

UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL POLICY FOR REAL PROPERTY
I. Background and Purpose:

General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. In 2010, the District
adopted the Revised Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution 17 Series of 2010), in order to enhance
the value and effectiveness of transit in the district by increasing ridership, and providing
opportunities for enhanced transit infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to encourage
innovation in leveraging RTD’s real property assets while establishing a consistent process and
transparent criteria for review and acceptance of any unsolicited proposals.
This policy replaces Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for Transit Oriented Development

from third parties wishing to acquire excess District Property or proposing a joint development
of District Property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has determined there is no current
or future transit interest.
3. Exclusive Negotiation Period: period of time which is granted to an entity to exclusively
negotiate with RTD staff the terms of a property disposition or joint development prior

otherwise established by the General Manager/CEO) will review the property to
determine if there is a current or future transit interest and if the property is
available for disposition.

a. Upon determining that District property is excess and available for disposition,
the District will arrange for an appraisal of the property to determine its Fair
Market Value. For Project Property, RTD must also secure Federal Transit
Administration concurrence prior to disposition.
b. Upon completion of an FMV appraisal and receipt of FTA concurrence (if

ii. Notice will identify any factors, in addition to offering price, to be
included within the evaluation of offers received. In addition to offering
price, the District may also evaluate cost savings through off-loading of
maintenance obligations as well as other value to the District.
iii. The notice period will be no shorter than 30 days and no longer than 60
days.
c. Excess property is offered AS IS, WHERE IS and WITH ALL FAULTS. It is the
District’s expectation that for unsolicited offers to acquire excess property, the
offeror will bear all costs associated with the acquisition including title

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager
and CEO

Date: December 1, 2015

From:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager,
Rail Operations

GM

Date:

December 1, 2015

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2015

Subject:

Approval of General Manager Authority
Regarding Eagle Project Operations and
Maintenance Annual Costs

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached resolution authorizing the Interim General Manager to execute all necessary work orders,
change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation
and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously
executed Concession Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors passed Resolution 10 authorizing the General Manger to
execute a Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project. The Eagle Project includes the East Corridor,
Gold Line and a portion of the Northwest Rail Line. A copy of that 2010 resolution is attached as
Exhibit A. The Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project extends to December 31, 2044 and includes
the design, construction, finance, operation and maintenance of the Project during that time period. The
authority provided by the Board in June 2010 allowed the General Manager to negotiate and execute all
necessary agreements, work orders, change orders and amendments for the construction phase of the
project in accordance with Resolution #10 and within the amount of $2.386 billion.
The attached resolution authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and execute all necessary work
orders, change orders and amendments for the operations and maintenance phase of the Concession, all
within the Board approved annual budget, and pursuant to any service changes authorized by the Board
for each runboard. Because capital expenditures are generally included in the annual budget and
programmed in the Strategic Budget Plan for years prior to approval, and the budget and runboard
changes are approved by the Board, this grant of authority will avoid the need for a separate Board
action for contract amendments or change orders to implement those Board approved expenditures and
changes.
DISCUSSION
Operations and maintenance of the Eagle Project is included in the Board approved Concession
Agreement. Payments for operation and maintenance are included in annual availability payments to be
made to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) under the Concession Agreement. A portion of each year’s
availability payment for operation and maintenance will be a part of the RTD annual budget. A portion

Packet Pg. 122

16.H

of the availability payment will be made directly by a trustee out of RTD sales tax receipts. Availability
payments under the Concession Agreement will commence in 2016.
It is anticipated that over time there may be a need to request that items serving the Eagle Project be
built or modified, and to modify service just as RTD monitors and adjusts all of its services to adapt to
customer needs. These changes will, if necessary, be negotiated as contract amendments, separate
agreements, or change orders with DTP or its subsidiaries. Each year staff will include the annual
appropriation amount of availability payments in the RTD annual budget, whether solely for the originally
contracted costs, or for additional capital or increased or modified service. Without the attached
Resolution, contract amendments, change orders or separate agreements in excess of the General
Manager’s Authority would need to be individually approved by the Board, in addition to the Board’s
approval of the budget and RTD service changes. Following approval of the budget and service changes
by the Board, staff will notify DTP and or its subsidiaries of such approval requiring them provide the
required commuter rail operations and maintenance, and any additional capital requirements for the
coming year. This process is clearly defined in the Concession Agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed within the budget approved by the Board for 2016 and each
subsequent year through 2044.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General
Manager to execute all necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with Denver
Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation and maintenance and any additional
capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously executed Concession
Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.
2. Decline the recommendation and require staff to seek approval each year or for each change
as frequently as may be required.

RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2015
GENERAL MANAGER AUTHORITY FOR ALL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE
PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THE EAGLE PROJECT CONCESSION AGREEMENT
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution 10, Series of 2010 the RTD Board of Directors
authorized entry into a Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for the
design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the Eagle Project which
includes the East, Gold and a portion of the Northwest Rail lines; and,
Whereas, it is expected that the design and construction of the Eagle Project will be
completed in 2016; and,
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution 10 annual appropriations will be made for a
portion of the availability payment to DTP each year for the operation and maintenance of
the Eagle Project; and,
Whereas, the Board may authorize service adjustments and capital expenditures
that require modifications to the availability payments or other payments to DTP or its
subsidiaries; and
Whereas the Board retains oversight of all payments and their purposes through the
annual budget process and the service change process,
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
The General Manager is authorized to execute contract amendments, change orders
and other necessary modifications to the Concession Agreement or enter into contracts
with subsidiaries of DTP throughout its duration to implement capital and service changes
included in the RTD annual budget and service plans.
Made and adopted this ___ day of December 2015.

Proposed 2016 Internal Audit Plan

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2016.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the internal
audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit plan
and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of twenty (20) audits are planned including
IT audits. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.

Do not approve the proposed plan. This is not recommended. The plan was developed including
input from numerous sources throughout the District and also includes the audits annually
required by the Board. Delaying the start of audit work will limit the days available for fieldwork
and could require a reduction in overall audit presence in the District.
