BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Strategic Plan Scorecard – Financial Metrics

October 7, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
October 22, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt to the Strategic Plan Agency Performance Scorecard, thereby
incorporating revisions to metrics related to the Strategic Priority of Financial Success.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals.
In alignment with this effort, staff developed a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard), which launched in May 2024. The performance dashboard provides answers
to these questions and serve as an easily accessible repository for performance data related to the
Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also be expanded over time to house information related
to the agency budget and financial reports, people power statistics, and other key measurements. The

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

performance dashboard enhances agency transparency and supports the Performance Committee’s
efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
Further, staff has developed a separate annual scorecard related to agency performance driven by an
operational vantage point. Related to this scorecard, staff has developed tactics and leading indicators
that stem from Strategic Initiatives related to agency performance.
DISCUSSION
As noted in the Strategic Plan document, and as contemplated by the Board and staff in 2021,
performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency metrics,
and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success outcomes is an
essential element of the Strategic Plan.
During the Performance Committee meeting on Monday, September 16, 2024, staff discussed potential
performance metrics related to the Strategic Priority of Financial Success, including:
•

•
•
•
•
•

Financial Trust Index: A weighted composite index measuring financial trust, calculated as
follows:
o Percentage of compliance with the nine ratios utilized by the Office of the State Auditor in
assessing financial health (50% of weighting):
▪ Cash to Liabilities
▪ Working Capital
▪ Asset Sufficiency
▪ Unrestricted Net Position
▪ Net Position
▪ Debt Burden
▪ Principal Payments to Total Outstanding Debt
▪ Tax Revenue per Capita
▪ Expenses per Capita
o Standard and Poor’s bond rating (20% of weighting)
o Average of Community Survey responses related to trust in financial management,
specifically in relation to the following prompts (30% of weighting):
▪ RTD manages its financial resources well
▪ RTD is a good financial steward of public funds
▪ The community's investment in transit provides value
▪ RTD's financial reporting is understandable and transparent
Budget Variability: % deviation from adopted budget
Cost per Revenue Hour: Inflation-adjusted operating cost per revenue hour
Debt Service Coverage: 1.2x coverage maintained
Monthly Reserves: Three months' operating reserves maintained
Fare Value: Percentage of customers who agree or strongly agree that fares are reasonable, as
measured by annual Customer Excellence surveys

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

The metrics are incorporated into the Agency Performance Scorecard for the Performance Committee’s,
and subsequently the Board’s, consideration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the Agency Performance Scorecard
revisions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
General Manager and CEO 360° Assessment Tool and
Final Assessment Form Project Check-In

October 7, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, Board meeting, the Board approved the 2024 General Manager and CEO
Performance Assessment Framework. The approved framework was developed in conversations
between past Chair Lynn Guissinger, current Chair Erik Davidson, the Performance Committee, the
Executive Committee, the Chief People Officer (CPO), and the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO).
Throughout those conversations a consensus was reached to retain an external consultant to work with
the GM/CEO and the Performance Committee to develop and conduct a 360° Assessment of the
GM/CEO position as well as assist the Board in the development and execution of its final performance
assessment of the GM/CEO.
On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for consulting services related to the
development and execution of a total Compensation Study, 360° Assessment instrument, and final
assessment tool, and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a contract for such services. The Board
Office worked with the CPO and RTD’s Contracting and Procurement Division to solicit, via a request for
quotes, qualified firms to develop and deploy a 360° Assessment Tool, as well as create and administer
the final GM/CEO performance assessment. On Tuesday, July 9, 2024, RTD entered into an agreement
with RKL Virtual Management (RKL) to develop and conduct the 360° Assessment and assist the Board
with the final performance assessment of the GM/CEO.
The RKL Team attended and presented at the Performance Committee’s meetings on July 22, 2024,
August 8, 2024, and September 9, 2024, to provide updates on the projects they were selected to
complete. To identify the performance components to be evaluated by the 360° Assessment Tool, RKL
reviewed the GM/CEO’s job description, RTD’s organizational values, interviewed all members of the
Performance Committee, and spoke with GM/CEO Johnson. Additionally, RKL conducted a brief survey
to collect additional feedback from all Directors. Through the feedback received, RKL developed an initial
set of questions to be included in the 360° Assessment Tool, which drive at how the GM/CEO is
performing relative to the Board-approved 2024 General Manager and CEO Performance Assessment
Framework. The initial set of questions has been distributed to Board members and GM/CEO Johnson for

Packet Pg. 8

1.D.1

collective input. The set of questions before the committee now reflects significant collaboration
between RKL, GM/CEO Johnson, and Board members.
Raters completing the 360° Assessment tool have been set. Three Directors were selected by Board
Chair Erik Davidson and Performance Committee Chair Catlin. Five direct reports to the GM/CEO and
four external raters recommended by the GM/CEO and reviewed by the Committee were randomly
selected at a meeting on Thursday, September 26, 2024, with representatives from RKL, the Board, and
a delegate from the GM/CEO’s office present.
On September 19, 2024, the Board Office circulated a draft final assessment tool to the Board, the
GM/CEO, and the CPO. This draft will eventually become the assessment tool each Director can
complete to assess the GM/CEO’s performance during the current performance cycle. Feedback on this
form was due to the Board office on Wednesday, October 2, 2024. RKL is now in the process of
incorporating that feedback and is seeking any additional feedback during the October 7, 2024,
Performance Committee meeting. The final assessment each Board member will be able to complete will
be distributed to Directors at the end of October 2024. In the meantime, RKL will continue to work with
the Board Office, Board leadership, the GM/CEO, and the CPO to finalize the assessment form. The form
will focus on assessing results in the performance areas agreed to in the Board-approved 2024 General
Manager and CEO Performance Assessment Framework.
DISCUSSION
Attached to this report is an RKL-created document listing the questions on the 360° tool, which were
developed through a collaborative process with RKL, the Board, and the GM/CEO. During the
Performance Committee meeting scheduled for Monday, October 7, 2024, the intent is for the
Committee and GM/CEO to reach final consensus on the 360° Assessment Tool and address any major
outstanding concerns.
The 360° Assessment Tool will be distributed to the agreed upon raters on Wednesday, October 9,
2024, to be returned no later than Wednesday, October 23, 2024. The results of the 360° Assessment
will be provided by RKL to the Board Office and GM/CEO no later than Thursday, October 31, 2024.
RKL will then present the results of the 360° Assessment Tool during an executive session on Monday,
November 18, 2024.
Also included as an attachment to this report is the draft final assessment tool to be used by the Board
to formally assess the GM/CEO. Given the timing of when feedback was requested, the attached form
has not incorporated any feedback received to date. The final assessment form will be finalized by Board
leadership and the GM/CEO in the coming weeks. The final assessment form will be distributed to all
Directors on Monday, October 28, 2024, and will be due back by Wednesday, November 6, 2024. RKL
will present the results of the final assessment during an executive session on Monday, November 18,
2024. The Committee and the GM/CEO are asked to provide additional feedback on the draft Board
assessment form.

Packet Pg. 9

1.D.1

This discussion aligns with all four strategic priorities (Customer Excellence, Community Value,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success) as the GM/CEO’s performance is directly tied to the
agency’s success in fulfilling its strategic priorities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from this discussion.

Rating Definition
The GM/CEO’s performance is critically deficient and does not meet expectations.
There is a fundamental lack of understanding or ability. Urgent need for
immediate improvement and possible reconsideration of their fit for the role.
The GM/CEO’s performance infrequently meets the minimum expectations and is
often not effective. The ability to consistently meet expectations is not evident.
Targeted development plans or coaching might be necessary.
The GM/CEO generally understands what is expected but does not apply this
understanding effectively in a leadership capacity. Performance meets basic
expectations occasionally. May benefit from structured development
opportunities to enhance performance delivery.
The GM/CEO reliably meets a standard level of performance. They demonstrate a
satisfactory skill set that keeps the Agency on track, but there is identifiable
potential for further growth and development.
The GM/CEO often performs above the expected standards by demonstrating
foresight, strong leadership, and ability to achieve better-than-expected
organizational outcomes.

Performance Category: Board Interaction

GM/CEO Annual Performance Evaluation
Evaluated by the Board of Directors

This evaluation form is designed to assess the General Manager/Chief Executive Officer’s (GM/CEO)
performance over the past year. The form is divided into three sections and each section is allocated a
maximum point value:
1. Performance based on Core Job Functions & Agency Values (64 maximum points);
2. Performance based on achievement of Short-Term Goals (36 maximum points); and
3. Open-ended feedback (no points).
Section 1 Description
The Core/Base Job & Agency Values section is split into three performance categories, each with a
specific maximum point allocation:

T

1. General Transit Management/Internal Relationships (34 maximum points),
2. Board Interaction (20 maximum points); and
3. External Relationships (10 maximum points).

AF

In the first section, Directors will be asked to rate the GM/CEO’s performance represented by the three
performance categories within Core/Base Job & Agency Values using the rating scale in the table below.

Exceeds
Expectations

Did not meet expectations due to performance issues, skill

Met all goals or performance expectations.
Clearly surpassed goal or performance expectations. Actions
lead to highly impactful results that were beyond
expectations.

Scoring Procedure: RKL will calculate the sum of the total scores for each performance category and
divide by the total possible score of each performance category. The resulting percentage will be
multiplied by the total number of points allocated to that performance category to calculate the final
score.
For example, if the GM/CEO receives a rating of 2 for each item under the General Transit
Management/Internal Relationships performance category, the GM/CEO’s category score will be 30 out
of a total possible point value of 45 or 67%. Sixty-seven percent of the total point value assigned to this
performance category results in a final category score of 23 out of 34.
Additionally, Directors will be provide the opportunity to provide open-ended comments at the end of
each of the three performance categories.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Customer Excellence Survey Results – Bus and Rail

October 7, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
45 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Plan), the Board established four Strategic Priorities and the
associated Success Outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Community Value: RTD Strives to be a strong
community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver Metro region
while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently
deliver high-quality customer service

Success Outcome
Establish baseline for community value index and
increase by 5%

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and
retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce

Establish baseline for employee net promoter
score and increase by 5%

Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the
management of all financial resources

50% of outcome is that RTD spends less money
than it receives; 50% of outcome is that the
community believes that it sees value in RTD’s
spending

Establish baseline for customer net promoter
score (NPS) and increase by 5%

RTD contracts with a third-party survey consultancy to conduct annual surveys to gauge agency
performance related to the Strategic Priorities of Customer Excellence and Community Value. The
consultancy administered community and paratransit customer surveys in June and July 2024.
DISCUSSION
Methodology. To gauge the agency’s 2024 performance related to Customer Excellence, survey teams
were deployed throughout the transit system between Wednesday, August 21 and Tuesday, September
1, 2024. The consultancy’s sampling plan was inclusive of the entire service area and included all bus
routes and light and commuter rail lines.
Surveys were conducted via intercepts of customers utilizing bus and rail services. All surveys were
available in English and Spanish. Language assistance services were made available in an additional 20
languages. Lastly, for customers who are blind or visually impaired, assistance was made available
through the agency’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office to complete the surveys.

1.D.2

Customer Characteristics. Respondents are representative of the Denver metro area. The services the
agency provides are important to the region’s economy, with work being the primary trip purpose for
bus and rail customers. With respect to demographics, the agency’s bus and rail customers are most
likely to be males between 18 to 39 years of age. More than half of surveyed customers identify as
White or Caucasian. Additionally, 20-21% of customers identify as Hispanic, Spanish, or Latino/a/x, and
14% identify as Black/African American. Additionally, 62% of bus customers and 54% of rail customers
have a household income of less than $50,000.
Survey Results: Satisfaction Measures and Customer NPS. Overall satisfaction for bus and rail services
decreased somewhat year over year. A total of 68% of bus customers and 63% of rail customers are
satisfied or very satisfied with RTD’s services in 2024, down from 76% and 78%, respectively, in
2023. In comparison to the national averages, RTD’s bus customers are 10% more satisfied, and rail
customers are 2% more satisfied.
The survey intercepts were conducted near the end of the first phase of the Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project (project), following several months of service delays and speed restrictions
related to preventative maintenance and state of good repair efforts. Half of bus customers and a
majority of light rail and commuter rail customers reported being impacted by these efforts, which likely
influenced their overall satisfaction with RTD’s service. Notably, exactly 50% of bus customers and
47% of rail customers reported they experienced no impacts. Further,19% of bus customers and 17%
of rail customers stated that the impacts were either somewhat or very positive. These results may
indicate these individuals recognize the value of asset management efforts to ensure the long-term
stability of the transit system.
Compared to 2023, Customer NPS results are higher for bus service and lower for rail service. The
overall Customer NPS is 13, meaning the agency has more promoters than detractors, and bus and rail
scores remain well above the national average.

Key Takeaways
§ RTD is setting the standard for customer experience with bus
and rail service in most areas

§ Overall satisfaction decreased on rail service, but the overall
Customer NPS score increased slightly due to increases in the
NPS for both bus and light rail

§ A high percentage of customers were negatively impacted by
the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project

§ Top opportunities for improvement by mode:
• Bus/light rail: Travel time
• Commuter rail: Frequency of service
