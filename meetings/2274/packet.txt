BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 8, 2015

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

April 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Increase
General
Counsel's
Settlement
Authority to Colorado Governmental Immunity
Act Claim Limits

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Counsel to settle claims made against the District up to the limits provided in the
Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA), C.R.S. 24-10-114.
BACKGROUND
Until 2013 the General Counsel had authority to settle claims against the District for amounts for which
the District could be liable under the CGIA. Resolution No. 19, Series of 2007 granted the General
Manager authority to approve and execute settlements of claims against the District in an amount not to
exceed $250,000 per claimant.
The General Manager delegated settlement authority to the General
Counsel. CGIA limited liability for tort claims, a category that covers most personal injury claims, to
$150,000 per person. In 2013 the CGIA was amended and individual claim limits were increased to
$350,000, adjusted every four years by the consumer price index for the Denver-Boulder-Greeley area.
The amendment applied to claims which accrued after July 1, 2013 and for which suits could be
brought starting in 2014.
DISCUSSION
RTD presently has 340 open liability claims. Claims are opened and closed on a revolving basis but
eventually all open claims will be subject to the new CGIA limits. RTD is self-insured for most liability
and manages claims with its in-house risk management and legal staffs. The types of liability claims
which can be brought against the District are limited by CGIA and include operation of vehicles, and
under limited circumstances, walkaways and some facilities. In addition, RTD is liable for claims in
contract or arising out of federal and state statutes. Increasing the General Counsel’s authority will
allow these claims to be settled within the claims budget to the level which most routine types of claims
require. Granting this authority is in keeping with how other types of claims are delegated. Claims
arising out of a project for which the General Manager has been granted budgetary authority are not
brought before the Board. RTD legal and claims staff subscribe to publications such as the Jury Verdict
Reporter, try cases in federal and state district courts, and attend alternative dispute resolution meetings
where experienced judges and attorneys discuss the potential value of claims.
Staff is continually
educated regarding potential outcomes should cases go to trial. The alternative to delegation would be
to bring claims before the Board which would be primarily reliant on counsel’s assessment in authorizing
settlement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from increased settlement authority. Following the change in CGIA
limits RTD began increasing self-insured reserves to account for potential settlements or judgments
under the new statutory limits, has an actuarial study performed each year and has its reserves audited
to ensure they are adequate.

1.B.1

ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Counsel to settle claims made against the District up to the limits provided
in the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA), C.R.S. 24-10-114.
2.

Do not authorize the General Counsel to settle claims against the District for the limits provided in
the CGIA. The General Counsel’s authority would in that case not exceed $250,000 which has
been delegated by the General Manager to the General Counsel. Claims in excess of that amount
would be brought to the Board for settlement authority.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 9, 2015

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

April 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Authorize to execute a budget transfer to
purchase thermal printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in an amount up to
$1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project in order to purchase and install the equipment necessary
to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed fare structure.
BACKGROUND
RTD has proposed a modified and simplified fare structure to the Board to be enacted in January 2016.
Under the new fare structure, it is proposed that transfers be eliminated and a day pass be offered to
customers for purchase on board RTD buses. The day pass is proposed to be priced at two times the
single fare and would allow a customer to have unlimited rides during a service day, thereby not
requiring a rider to purchase a fare at each transfer.

DISCUSSION
In order to make the day pass widely available to RTD’s patrons, the ability to purchase day passes is
needed at the location where a patron accesses RTD’s services either on buses or at rail platforms. RTD
currently has the ability to sell day passes at rail platforms through ticket vending machines (TVMs) and
at sales outlets but currently does not have the ability to offer day passes to patrons who purchase their
first fare upon entering a bus. In order to offer a day pass on buses, a thermal printer would be installed
in each bus whereby a customer would pay for the day pass through the farebox and the operator would
produce a day pass from the thermal printer. The day pass will be printed on watermarked paper and
would clearly indicate the service day for which it is valid.
Although the Board has not yet authorized RTD to implement the new fare structure, authority to enter a
contract for the purchase and installation of thermal printers is being sought at this time due to the lead
time necessary to complete this procurement to meet the January 2016 fare structure implementation. If
the final Board action approving changes to RTD’s 2016 fare policy does not include a day pass, thus
negating the need for thermal printers, this funding will not be used.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of installing thermal printers on each of the approximately 1,000 buses in the RTD
fleet is $1,900,000. This cost includes the equipment as well as the connections and installation
necessary to tie the printers into the RTD network.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

The funding necessary for this procurement would come from a portion of the Certificate of Participation
(COP) proceeds that were authorized by the Board to be used for the replacement of Mall Shuttles.
Therefore, there would be no need to seek additional funding for this procurement and no budgetary
impact other than the transfer of funds from one project to another. These funds will be backfilled
through the 2015 amended budget process.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer in order to purchase
and install the equipment necessary to accommodate the sale of fare media under the proposed
2016 fare structure. This action grants authority to execute a budget transfer in an amount not
to exceed $1,900,000 from the Mall Shuttle project. This is the recommended action.

2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a budget transfer. This action
would result in RTD’s inability to procure needed day pass fare media equipment in time to
provide the ability for patrons to purchase day passes on buses and avoid multiple fare payments
for transfers. This is not the recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 9, 2015

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

April 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to execute a lease amendment
for Smart Card and / or thermal printers

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the First Amendment to
the Lease Purchase Agreement related to the Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND
In 2013 the District issued Certificates of Participation (COPs) to fund the acquisition of buses and
ticket vending machines. The original plan for use of these funds included the acquisition of new
Mall Shuttle buses. Since 2013, the anticipated Mall Shuttle bus manufacturer has gone bankrupt
and the timeline to replace the Mall Shuttles has been delayed.
Also during this time, staff has identified a need for funding in the amount of approximately
$5,700,000 for the following two projects:
1. Expansion of the Xerox contract related to the smart card project ($3,800,000).
2. Thermal printers to support the proposed new fare structure including the purchase of day
passes on buses ($1,900,000).
This action item discusses the amendment of the Lease Purchase Agreement related to the
Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A and the reallocation of some of the funds originally
planned to be spent on Mall Shuttles.

DISCUSSION
The District’s Bond Counsel, Butler Snow, has provided the attached Resolution which authorizes the
execution and delivery of the attached first amendment to the lease purchase agreement related to
the Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A and would allow the District to fund the smart card
and thermal printer expenses identified above. Since the Board previously approved the funding of
the Xerox project in March but has not yet approved the thermal printers, this amendment to the
lease is structured in such a way that either or both projects can be funded with the existing Mall
Shuttle funds following Board approval.
Although the approximate cost of the two requests above is $5,700,000 the Resolution provides for
funding of up to $6,000,000. This allows for the possibility of future board action approving some
additional related project costs without the need to amend the lease a second time.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.3

This first amendment to the Lease has been approved by the trustee bank. Bond counsel will provide
the trustee with an opinion that the First Amendment is authorized by the Lease as required by the
Indenture of Trust.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Any 2013 COP Mall Shuttle funds that remain after funding one or both of the two projects above
will be used for bus acquisitions as originally anticipated, possibly even mall shuttles if an appropriate
manufacturer is identified. Any additional funding that may be needed for Mall Shuttles as a result
of this lease amendment is anticipated to be obtained through future COP issuances.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2015, authorizing the execution and delivery of a first amendment to the lease purchase
agreement relating to the 2013 lease purchase agreement and authorizing the General
Manager to take action in connection therewith. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2015, authorizing the execution and delivery of a first amendment to the lease purchase
agreement relating to the 2013 lease purchase agreement and authorizing the General
Manager to take action in connection therewith. This is not the recommended action as it
would not provide the funding previously approved by the Board in March, 2015 for the
expansion of the Xerox contract in relation to the smart card project.

the amendments set forth in this First Amendment do not materially adversely affect the interests
of the Owners of the 2013A Certificates; and
WHEREAS, the Trustee has given its written consent to the execution and delivery of
this First Amendment; and
WHEREAS, the District and the Corporation desire to amend and supplement the Lease
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this First Amendment.
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and the
representations, covenants and warranties herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1.1
The acquisition and installation of thermal printers, equipment
related to the SmartCard project and other necessary fare collection equipment (collectively, the
“Additional Fare Collection Equipment”) in the maximum principal amount of $6,000,000 shall
constitute a Cost of the Project under the Lease and the Trustee shall be authorized to disburse
moneys on deposit in the Project Fund to pay the costs of acquiring, installing and implementing
the operation of the Additional Fare Collection Equipment.
Section 1.2
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the
Lease or in the Indenture, the Additional Fare Collection Equipment shall not be included as
2013A Leased Property under the Lease. The District shall retain ownership of the Additional
Fare Collection Equipment and such Additional Fare Collection Equipment shall not be subject
to the terms and provisions of the Lease.
Section 1.3
Exhibit C to the Lease, which sets forth the Release and
Amortization Schedule, shall be amended and restated in whole, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C and by this reference made a part hereof. Under the provisions of the Lease, upon the
payment of the principal component of Base Rentals under the Lease in the total cumulative
amount of at least $10,110,000, corresponding components of the 2013A Leased Property are to
be deemed amortized and released from the provisions of the Lease, as further provided in
Section 12.3 of the Lease and Exhibit C to the Lease. Under the terms of the Lease, the payment
of the principal component of Base Rentals in the total cumulative amount of $10,110,000 is
expected to be made on or prior to May 15, 2015. The Additional Fare Collection Equipment is
expected to be acquired with moneys on deposit in the Project Fund subsequent to May 15, 2015,
and therefore the Additional Fare Collection Equipment will not become 2013A Leased Property
under the Lease but will be deemed to be amortized and released for purposes of Exhibit C and
Section 12.3 of the Lease.
Section 1.4
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in the
Lease or in the Indenture, (a) the District and the Corporation shall not be required to assign to
the Trustee any rights under any contract relating to the manufacture of the Additional Fare
Collection Equipment; and (b) if directed in writing by the District, the Trustee shall be
authorized to disburse money from the Project Fund to make payments under any contract
relating to the Additional Fare Collection Equipment without such contract being assumable by
the Trustee.

RESOLUTION NO. ___, SERIES OF 2015
AUTHORIZING THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF A
FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE PURCHASE AGREEMENT
RELATING TO THE 2013 LEASE PURCHASE AGREEMENT;
AND AUTHORIZING THE GENERAL MANAGER TO TAKE
ADDITIONAL ACTION IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.
WHEREAS, the Regional Transportation District in the City and County of
Broomfield, the City and County of Denver and the Counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Douglas, Jefferson and Weld in the State of Colorado (the “District”) was created by the General
Assembly of the State of Colorado in 1969 by Chapter 231, Laws of Colorado 1969, which is
currently codified as Sections 32-9-101 through 32-9-164, inclusive, of the Colorado Revised
Statutes (the “Act”) and the District’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and officers from time to
time, including the present incumbents, have been duly chosen and qualified; and
WHEREAS, the District is authorized by the Act to develop, maintain and operate
a mass transportation system and in connection therewith to purchase or otherwise acquire real
and personal property; and
WHEREAS, the District has previously entered into a Lease Purchase Agreement,
dated as of May 9, 2013 (the “Lease”) between the District and RTD Asset Acquisition

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 8, 2015

From:

Doug MacLeod, Controller

GM

Date:

April 8, 2015

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2015

Subject:

Adoption of 2016 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2016 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. There are 23
specific performance measures in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the context of its
mission statement. A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is
presented to the Board of Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance
measures for 2016 are brought to the Board of Directors for approval at this time because the
measures are used in development of the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and 2016 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2015 to 2016 are listed below:
 Goal 1.4 Reduce the number of light rail accidents
o Reportable Light Rail/Auto Accidents per month is removed while Reportable Light Rail
Accidents per 100,000 miles – Preventable is retained. The first measure is considered
no longer relevant as the focus should be directed to preventable accidents. The
revised measure is now the equivalent in Rail as for Bus (Goal 1.1).


Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on time performance
o The goal for system-wide on time performance is reduced for Local On-Time Bus Service
from 88.0% to 86.0% and similarly reduced for Regional & Express On-Time Service
from 94.0% to 92.0%. On-time service data has been collected since 2011 using
Automated Passenger Counters which have a GPS component. This automated
collection method has enabled the collection of far more accurate data regarding
scheduled and actual on-time performance.
Data counts alone have exceeded
18,000/day vs. 240/day using the previous observational method.
The new data
capture methodology has shown on-time performance consistently in the 83%-86%
range for local service. A peer review survey indicated actual on-time performance of
82% on average.



Goal 3.3 Improve miles between road calls

Packet Pg. 21

1.B.4

o

The goal for Mileage Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls is increased from
26,000 to 28,000 miles. The improvement is expected due to the new bus vehicles
that dominate the bus fleet and require fewer maintenance road calls. A lost service
maintenance road call is a maintenance-related problem that results in a revenue vehicle
being traded, towed, or repaired on the street causing a service delay of 1 minute or
more. Mileage between lost service road calls is calculated by dividing actual miles
operated by the number of lost service maintenance road calls.



Goal 6.1 Maintain all required recovery ratios
A yes/no indication of whether the required SB154 Cost Recovery ratio is met is added
along with the ratio’s definition. The definition of the Operating Cost Recovery ratio is
also added (this ratio is not required by law but has a Board-approved goal of 20%).
The difference between the two ratios is essentially the use of a wider revenue base
that includes federal grants and investment income in the SB154 ratio’s numerator. The
required SB154 ratio is 30% and the calculation will be provided with the Financial
Status Reports at each quarter-end only.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall Ridership Increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2016 Annual Budget in November 2015 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model and it is carried as a placeholder at this time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2016 Annual Budget in November 2015 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

It is noted that we will develop a performance protocol for commuter rail linked to the concessionaire
agreement with Denver Transit Operators and such measurement report will be brought to the Board
for review at a later date.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2016 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2016 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2016 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2016 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2016 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2016 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2016 Requested Budget.

3. Do not adopt the 2016 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2016 Performance Report.

Board Meeting Date: April 14, 2015

Subject:

Review of 2016 -2021 SBP Development
Process and 2016 Budget Assumptions

BACKGROUND
Staff has prepared the attached presentation to give the Board the opportunity to offer early,
substantive input in the development of the RTD 2016 Annual Budget. The purpose is to provide a
framework for conversation and to confirm Board approved parameters for decision making in the
development of the 2016 Budget and 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
DISCUSSION
The Strategic Budget Plan is RTD’s six year financial plan for the Base System. It is updated
annually and provides important cash flow planning information used to develop the upcoming new
capital budget and overall scope of program activity, including hours of service the District can afford
to provide. (See attached power point presentation.)
In the early stages of the development of the SBP and annual Budget, staff looks to the Board for
guidance regarding key budget objectives and assumptions that are to be used in the generation of
the financial plans. This is to inform the Board that staff intends to use these existing guidelines
unless overriding instructions are received. Parameters currently considered in the preparation of the
District’s 2016-2021 SBP and 2016 Budget are:
(1) fiscal management, including requirements to operate per specified performance goals and
to maintain a balanced budget
(2) continued development of Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund
(3) continued implementation of Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations
(4) optimization of service levels for bus and light rail systems
(5) fuel lock for budget certainty
(6) State of Good Repair (SOGR) of facilities and equipment
(7) prioritization of capital and expense projects
(8) Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiated costs through 2017
(9) planned fleet expansion/replacement and Certificate of Participation (COP) financing
(10) cost allocation to West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, and I-225 Rail Line
based on resource drivers
Material uncontrollable variables which significantly impact RTD’s budgeting process and financial
planning can change, however. The following items will affect RTD in the development of the 20162021 SBP and 2016 Budget:
(1) sales and use tax revenues
a. current quarterly CU-Leeds School forecast (March 2015) for sales and use tax
indicates an increase in 2015 of 7.1% above 2014 collections

Packet Pg. 34

1.C.1

b. actual sales and use tax year-to-date February 2015 increased 9.5% over same
time prior year
c. forecast for 2016 is an increase of 4.8% over 2015
(2) fuel costs
a. diesel fuel is locked in 2015 at $2.95/gallon
b. 2016 diesel futures estimate is $2.12/gallon at this time
c. current contract is in its first option year (second contract year); RTD must exercise
the second and final option prior to lock
(3) inflation rate/Consumer Price Index
a. using Moody’s CPI forecasts and not Colorado Legislative Council, now agree with
FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE)
b. Denver/Boulder area: Moody’s CPI forecasts applied to operating and maintenance
costs/expense and capital project costs
2015: 1.1%
2016: 3.1%
2017: 3.5%
2018: 3.3%
2019: 3.1%
2020: 2.8%
2021: 2.8%
c. National: Moody’s CPI forecasts applied to fuel costs
2015: 0.6%
2016: 2.6%
2017: 2.7%
2018: 2.7%
2019: 2.5%
2020: 2.3%
2021: 2.2%
(4) fare increases
a. continual review with Board of periodic fare increases
b. per policy, the Board will consider a fare revenue increase of 10% every three
years; scheduled increase for 2014 was deferred to 2015 and then to 2016
c. assumption is, therefore, a 10% fare rate increase in 2016
d. no fare rate increases have occurred since 2011
e. proposed new fare structure is targeted to meet 2016 fare revenue in SBP
(5) additional grant revenues as they become available within Board policy
(6) economic conditions in Colorado and the District
(7) impact of State legislation and audit adjustments on sales and use tax revenue

CONCLUSION
Staff is seeking agreement to proceed with the guidelines and parameters identified to develop a first
draft of the SBP, which staff tentatively plans to present to the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee at the Budget Study Session on April 28, 2015.

Internal Audit Charter

Internal auditing is an independent objective assurance and consulting activity
established within the Regional Transportation District to examine and evaluate its
activities. The objectives are to assist management in the effective discharge of their
responsibilities by providing them with analyses, appraisals, recommendations, counsel,
information concerning the activities reviewed, and by promoting effective controls at a
reasonable cost.
Audit Scope
The scope of internal auditing encompasses the examination and evaluation of the
adequacy and effectiveness of the RTD’s system of internal controls. It includes:







Reviewing the reliability and integrity of financial and operating information and the
means used to identify, measure, classify, and report such information.
Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with those policies, plans,
procedures, laws, and regulations that could have a significant impact on operations.
Reviewing the means of safeguarding assets and, as appropriate, verifying the
existence of such assets.
Reviewing and appraising the effectiveness and efficiency with which resources are
employed.
Evaluating operations or programs to ascertain whether results are consistent with
established goals and objectives.
Ensuring that risks are appropriately identified and managed across RTD.

Independence and Accountability
All internal audit activities must be free from undue influence or interference in the selection
of activities to be examined, determination of the scope or methodology of work, and in
communication of the results in accordance with the standards of independence as set forth
by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
The Manager of Internal Audit reports administratively to the Assistant General Manager of
Communication with complete and independent direct access to the General Manager and
CEO for audit related purposes. The Manager of Internal Audit is accountable to the Board
of Directors through its Financial Administration and Audit Committee (FAAC). The

(5) December 2014 was high due to payments made on 2014 year-end accrual of expenses
(6) Increase is mainly due to the planned draw down of funds from the TIFIA loan
(7) Primarily represents the long-term liability to DTP for Eagle which will continue to grow until TABOR payments begin after construction
(8) Negative position is due to timing difference related to paying contractial obligations first then draw grant and debt proceeds to replenish the reserves. Base system negative position primarily due to
the accrual of the Net Pension Obligation
(9) Increase is due to the increase to fund balances per the 2015 adopted budget
