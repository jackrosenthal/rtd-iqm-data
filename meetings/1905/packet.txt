BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 26, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 26, 2014

Board Meeting Date: April 10, 2014

Subject:

Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage
Tracks

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve funding
for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks
are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by the overall FasTracks program. The storage
tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail system.
BACKGROUND
The District’s original plans for FasTracks expansion included the addition of a new light rail vehicle
(LRV) maintenance and storage facility. As the scope of the FasTracks Plan was refined, the decision
was made to expand the existing Elati LRV maintenance facility instead of adding a new facility to save
costs. All LRV maintenance and mid-day and overnight storage is currently performed at the Elati and
Mariposa maintenance facilities. This setup was able to successfully support the opening of the West
Rail Line without negatively impacting the operations of the current system. However, the planning for
and opening of the West Rail Line made it evident that this system is not expected to be able to support
the I-225 Rail Line without impacts to the reliability of current light rail operations.
The I-225 Rail Line is located much farther from the existing maintenance facilities so it is difficult to
support mid-day and overnight storage of the entire I-225 LRV fleet without causing disruptions to the
existing service. The light rail system will not be able to support all pull-outs from Elati and Mariposa
with the addition of the I-225 trains. This would require the signal system to constantly operate over
capacity (yellow signals) which reduces system reliability. In addition, the overnight maintenance
window would be severely impacted making it nearly impossible to do maintenance work on the line
during that period.
DISCUSSION
Rail Operations has identified additional train storage capacity as a critical element in being able to
maintain reliable service on the existing system and future corridors. Rail Operations, Planning and
Capital Programs staff worked together to develop a solution that would solve the operations needs
without major budget or schedule implications to the I-225 project and entire FasTracks program.
This solution is to add the following infrastructure to the I-225 Rail Line: 1. Additional storage tracks at
the Peoria Station with capacity to store 18 LRVs on the tail tracks and 2. One layover track adjacent to
the 13th Avenue Station that will allow for emergency storage of LRVs. The infrastructure improvements
at the Peoria Station will also include a small building to be used for train operator reporting and storage
of equipment used for interior LRV cleaning.
The Peoria tail track storage coupled with the small building will allow for up to 18 LRVs for the I-225
Rail Line to start and end their day on the corridor and relieve the stress that would have been put on
the existing system by requiring all trains to pull in and out of Elati and Mariposa every day. No major
maintenance or exterior cleaning will be performed at Peoria as this can all be handled at Elati. Train

Packet Pg. 4

2.12.A

schedules will need to be written so that the LRVs stored at Peoria constantly rotate so all LRVs can be
serviced at Elati on a regular basis.
This is a necessary project to support light rail asset management and state of good repair. Without
these storage tracks, RTD will incur significant operations costs. The signal system would likely require
upgrades to support the number of trains that would need to deadhead from Elati to the Southeast and I225 corridors. In addition, there would be ongoing costs associated with increased mileage on the LRVs
and overhead contact system (OCS). Special accommodations would also be necessary for overnight
maintenance along the line which would require the added cost of providing service with bus bridges due
to the limited maintenance windows.
It is important that this item be funded now as performing this work while the I-225 Rail Line is still
under construction will be significantly less expensive and less disruptive to ongoing service than waiting
until the line is complete. In addition, many of the components of this work such as special track work
(switches and crossovers), signal equipment and power facilities are long lead items that require early
action in order to complete this work by opening day of the I-225 Rail Line.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $12 million capital cost to construct the light rail storage tracks will be funded from the overall
FasTracks program because these improvements are necessary to support the entire light rail system. It
is anticipated that the payback period for the $12 million capital expenditure will be 7-10 years through
potential reductions in ongoing operating and maintenance costs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the
I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by
the overall FasTracks program. The storage tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail
system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to approve funding for the
construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project. This will have negative
implications for light rail system reliability and increased operating costs. This is not recommended.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: April 10, 2014

Subject:

Adoption of 2015 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2015 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 23 performance measures
in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2014 to 2015 are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
o The goal for Average Facilities Maintenance Complaints per Month is increased to <
20.0 from < 14.0 per month to reflect more accurate reporting on these measures and
system growth in facilities that is challenging our resources.



Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on time performance
o The goal for Local On-Time Service is changed from 88% to 86%. The goal for
Regional & Express On-Time Service is changed from 94% to 92%. These goals are
changed to reflect actual performance since 2011 while still setting a target for
improvement. These are more realistic goals when compared to our agency peer group.



Goal 4.1 Reduce average customer response time
o Average TIC Call Wait Time is revised to “Average TIC Speed of Answer”. The new
manager in TIC determined that the TIC call wait time was not being measured
accurately, and it is proposed that speed of answer is a more relevant and measurable
goal. Speed of answer measures the time from ring to answer and includes hold time.
The goal of < 75.0 seconds remains unchanged.
o Response Time on TIC Customer Inquiries was established at < 1.0 day and is found to
be no longer relevant. Response time on TIC customer inquiries is actually immediate in
that all TIC calls are answered as received. The measure is removed.



Goal 4.2 Improve level of customer complaints

Packet Pg. 13

2.12.B

o

Regarding Average Response Time to Customer Complaints, it is proposed that Initial
Response and Final Resolution be consolidated into one measure entitled “Average
Cycle Time”. This is the average number of days between when a customer contact is
entered for action and when the action is completed (closed). It is a measure of the
number of days required for RTD departments to research and resolve issues reported to
RTD by customers. The goal will remain at < 10 days and it is proposed that the
measure be reported by category as follows:
 RTD Transportation (Bus and Rail)
 RTD All Other Departments
 First Transit – Commerce City
 First Transit – Denver
 First Transit – Longmont
 Veolia



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall Ridership Increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2015 Annual Budget in November 2014 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model and it is noted as a placeholder at this time. It is a forecast.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2015 Annual Budget in November 2014 and are noted as placeholders until that point.
These are forecasts.
o EcoPass Revenue is eliminated from this measurement because it is considered no
longer relevant and the category has had zero to negative growth as large contract
users have been converting to other fare media such as FlexPass.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2015 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2015 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2015 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2015 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2015 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2015 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2015 Performance Report.

enforcement campaign, TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington

Date: April 3, 2014

From:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

April 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: April 10, 2014

Subject:

Approval of contract award for Light Rail
Training Simulator

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to approve a contract with OKTAL in an amount not to
exceed $1,543,000 to procure and install a Light Rail training simulator at the Elati Light Rail Facility.
BACKGROUND
Rail Operations identified the need for a simulator in 2010 but funding was not available but funding
became available in 2013 via the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) process.
The complexity of our system, the number of trains we run, and the difficulty that our trainers have in
getting time on the mainline to train new operators without interfering with regular service makes this
tool extremely important. It allows new operators to become familiar with the vehicle and the operating
environment without risk to people or property. It also allows instructors to observe and correct operator
behavior and techniques in a controlled environment. The tool is flexible enough to expand as the system
expands and will pay dividends for years to come.
The procurement process began in December 2013. This process resulted in the receipt of six (6)
proposals. Several proposers set up demonstrations of their products at the Elati facility to aid in the
evaluation process.
DISCUSSION
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was advertised and made available to prospective proposers December
17, 2013. In January of 2014 a briefing for interested proposers was held and written questions from
prospective proposers were received. In February 2014 responses to written questions were sent to
prospective proposers. Proposals were due on February 19, 2014 2:00 p.m. to Contracts and
Procurement, RTD, 1600 Blake Street, Denver, Colorado.
Proposals were received from six (6) potential suppliers with oral presentations, if necessary, by selected
finalists the week of March 3, 2014. Final selection to be made no later than April 15, 2014.
As a result of this process we recommend that the RTD Board of Directors authorize General Manager,
or his designee, to accept the proposal from OKTAL, one of the world leaders in this technology.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project was included in the 2013 capital budget for Rail Operations. The price proposed
by OKTAL does not exceed the budgeted funds of $1,543,500 for this project.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Award the contract to OKTAL as recommended

Packet Pg. 26

2.12.C

2) Cancel the procurement and resolicit. This not recommended since this will cause additional
delays in the acquisition and installation of this vital tool.
