Lakewood the 2.5% = $5.2 million.

Lakewood. This IGA does not commit any present funding by either Party.
Implementation of this IGA implies future financial commitments by both
Parties subject to future RTD Board of Directors and Lakewood City Council
approvals, and is subject to each respective agency’s legally required

 Recommendation for Selection of Outside Legal Counsel – PPP Concession
Agreement
Director Brohl asked about possible conflicts of interest because Freshfields is
representing BART in the PPP as well. Marla Lien explained the process and that
it isn’t really a direct conflict of interest. Every application is considered on a
unique basis. The District is looking for expertise in drafting long term contracts
and that is what we need the legal assistance with.
Director Chacon gave her concern about a diversity component in the contract.
Marla Lien responded that the DBE office did not put a DBE component on it.
Both companies provided their EEO1 reports. Freshfields ranks high on a diversity
scale on a national level.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract in the
amount of $1 million for the 2008 work effort to the firms of Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and Kaplan Kirsch & Rockwell LLP (Freshfields) as the
most qualified firm in outside legal counsel to RTD to assist in all steps necessary
to draft a concession agreement to procure a concessionaire and for construction
of the Gold and East Corridor commuter rail lines and commuter rail maintenance
facility through a Public Private Partnership (PPP). Funds in the amount of $1
million are included in the 2008 FasTracks Budget.
Motion: Director Brohl made a motion
for full approval before the
