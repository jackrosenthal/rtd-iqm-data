C. Updates

• Federal Update - Former Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater
Committee Chair Folska introduced Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs who
gave a brief update on recent Federal developments.
Mike Dino said that the President’s 2016 Fiscal Year Budget was released.
In it, RTD was allocated $92 million under New Starts Full Funding Grant
Agreements for the Southeast extension. He noted that the President’s plan
to fund transportation is not too dissimilar from what is being discussed in
Congress: repatriating oversea profits and raising the gas tax.
Mike Dino pointed out that the President’s proposed budget also includes a
significant addition to the TIGER and TIFIA programs, increasing the
awarding possibilities for RTD and Colorado. He said that the President’s
budget is an indication of where his priorities are.
He noted that Squire Patton Boggs in Washington, DC, is coordinating with
the Directors and staff to ensure the visit during the APTA Legislative
Conference in March, 2015 will build on last year’s trip.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Mike Dino for the update.

Secretary Slater started his comments by expressing how pleased he was to
be in the Mile High City, which has never been short on vision and
determination, always providing for the citizens. He noted that
transportation is more than just concrete, asphalt, and steel. It is about the
roads we all travel to become who we are and serve in the capacity that we
serve.
Secretary Slater said that he had a chance to experience all the work RTD is
doing on his way from the airport and while touring Denver Union Station
(DUS). He mentioned that his colleagues at Squire Patton Boggs keep him
informed of RTD’s work.
Secretary Slater noted that this week, President Obama unveiled his $478
billion budget, giving communities like this one funds to move forward.
Secretary Slater trusts that Congress will have a discussion that can lead to
common ground, then higher ground, regarding transportation. He quoted
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who said he is, “looking
forward to working with the president in all budget matters”.
Secretary Slater pointed out that current Secretary of Transportation,
Anthony Foxx, met with former Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta
and Google CEO Eric Schmidt on Monday, February 2, 2015. It was at
Google’s headquarters that Secretary Foxx launched “Beyond Traffic: Trends
and Choices,” the Department’s 30-year draft framework on the future of
transportation. The conversation included the development of technology,
such as driverless vehicles. Secretary Foxx mentioned that in 30 years
Omaha, NE would be as congested as Los Angeles, CA unless transportation
challenges are dealt with today. Secretary Slater noted that not dealing with
these challenges leads to gridlock, which is wasted time, wasted dollars,
and wasted lives.
Secretary Slater commended RTD for its partnerships with different metro
Denver communities and agencies. He said Denver is one of the most
dynamic, visionary cities in the world when it comes to transportation,
including bike systems. He encouraged RTD to continue doing what it’s
been doing: delivering projects on time or early and under budget. This, he

Committee Chair Folska said it was an honor to introduce former Secretary
of Transportation Rodney E. Slater. She noted that he has an extraordinary,
humbling, and inspiring background. Committee Chair Folska asked Director
Francone to read Secretary Slater’s bio, given that February is Black History
month and considering his contributions to transportation and the
community. A copy is available at the RTD Board of Director’s office.

6.A

Secretary Slater exhorted the RTD Board to continue working together by
being transparent, expressing their opinions, and leaving the table as a
united body. He emphasized that unity does not mean uniformity, but
working through issues. Secretary Slater encouraged the Directors to keep
engaging with the Governor’s office and the Denver Mayor’s office. He
prompted RTD to keep dreaming big and working together just like with the
DUS project, which has brought about new development and life to the area.
Secretary Slater said that there needs to be more projects like DUS so other
cities can believe the best days are ahead of them.
Secretary Slater thanked the Directors for being at the meeting. He thanked
RTD for allowing him to work with the agency during his tenure as Secretary
of Transportation. He was grateful he gets to work again with RTD during
his tenure at Squire Patton Boggs.
Committee Chair Folska thanked Secretary Slater for his remarks.
Director Walker said that he was able to watch the last 20-30 minutes of
Secretary Foxx speech at the Google headquarters. Two things stood out to
him:
 “We cannot keep budgeting for a number, budget for a desired
outcome”
 “Google could not be where they are today if they had a ten month
budget”
Director Walker noted that these two points are encouraging for agencies,
such as RTD, who are in the process of putting together a long term
strategic plan.
Director Walker asked Secretary Slater what he thought would be the impact
of driverless vehicles, such as the Google driverless car, to transit agencies.
Secretary Slater replied that this technology would revolutionize transit
agencies. He said that currently there is technology for maps pointing out
areas of congestion. As drivers embrace this technology, including the cars
that utilize it, it would afford them to alter their routes, thereby improving
the flow of traffic for transit vehicles on fixed routes. He noted that other
technology available includes self-parking cars, backing up awareness,
cameras, truck-locking technology providing fuel efficiency and safety, etc.
Secretary Slater added that some people are even talking about the
Hyperloop as a form of transportation, which is almost like flying through
space. There are many people that say this is not possible but there was a
time when flying was considered impossible.

said, is the powerful punch that prompted the President to include two RTD
projects in the budget.

Director Tobiassen expressed his intrigue by Secretary Slater’s comments on
Google. Director Tobiassen noted that his current day job is in the
Department of Defense (DOD), who has recently began to work with Google
as well. Director Tobiassen said that the DOD is stakeholder-centric.
Google’s conversation brings a user-centric point of view. Director
Tobiassen asked Secretary Slater his thoughts on the user-centric paradigm
as it relates to RTD and transit agencies, which are traditionally stakeholdercentric. Secretary Slater used DUS as an example of a project that was
stakeholder-centric in its plan and design yet user-centric in application. He
noted that the development around DUS, such as apartment buildings with
multi-use facilities on the first levels (groceries, cleaners, other quality of life
essentials), allow for a compact, user-centric community.
Secretary Slater added that the Federal Highway system was originally part
of the DOD. He noted that President Eisenhower had defense at the center
of the transportation network as a way to better deploy troops. Secretary
Slater pointed out that during his tenure as Secretary of Transportation,
President Clinton signed an executive order allowing for more civilian use of
GPS technology, which at the time was only used for military purposes. He
said that aviation originally was for defense purposes but it was not until
after World War II that it was used for mail and other user-centric purposes.
Director Francone noted that District N, which she represents, is fairly large
in size and accommodates both mountain and urban population. She asked
Secretary Slater his thoughts on best serving such a varied population.
Secretary Slater thanked Director Francone for the introduction she read
earlier. He noted that transportation brings different communities together
by giving users choices, thereby giving them opportunities. He noted that
RTD services are already doing this. He encouraged Director Francone and
the Board to continue going out to the community they represent and being
a part of the community they represent. Secretary Slater suggested asking
the constituents how RTD can be more user-centric, encouraging the agency
to continue doing community forums. He proposed that engaging in this
manner would allow for discovering blind spots that the Directors may have.
He applauded RTD’s efforts in working together with other entities to
strategically plan for the metropolitan area. Secretary Slater noted that
President Clinton threatened to veto transportation funding if there was not
a high level of funding for transit as well as transportation. He pointed out
that President Clinton was from Arkansas, where there is little transit,
meaning that transit experience is not necessary to understand its necessity.
Chair Sisk expressed the Board appreciation in working with Mike Dino. He
acknowledged Senator Bennett’s bipartisan work in funding the
transportation bill. Chair Sisk asked Secretary Slater how the Highway Trust
Fund could realistically be funded. Secretary Slater mentioned that a
recommendation for a gas tax increase may not be mentioned but might be

Director Anderson recalled sitting next to Mike Dino during her tenure in
DRCOG at the time TEA-21 was being enacted. She thanked Secretary
Slater for his contributions not only to transportation but also to the Civil
Rights movement. Secretary Slater noted how transportation has played
such a significant role in the Civil Rights arena; he mentioned Plessy vs.
Ferguson (train) and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Selma and U.S. HWY 80.
He also noted that Memphis, TN was the main city near his hometown
growing up. He remembers the day in 7th grade when Dr. King met his fate
in his favorite city resolving then to become a lawyer and make changes
happen. During his Junior year of High School he ended up in the Principal’s
office for protesting his inability to participate in a program honoring Dr.
King. He was arrested, tried and not able to participate in football during his
Senior year, which would have been his source for a college scholarship.
Secretary Slater mentioned that everyone can remember a moment in their
story where they made a decision that has brought them to where they are
at today. He thanked everyone for making the decisions that have brought
them to this place.
Director Solano thanked Secretary Slater. He noted the similarities between
the Latino and Black communities and how these communities have come
together. Director Solano asked Secretary Slater about the influence of
telecommunications in transportation. Secretary Slater replied that
telecommunications has created a more “distracted drivers”. He noted that
the telecommunication technology on the dashboard has been created as
part of an experience to sell. Some auto companies, like Tesla, are classified
as technology companies. Secretary Slater said that this challenge can be
managed. Using telecommunication technology such as crash avoidance
systems and roadway correction would really benefit transportation. He
noted that telecommunication technology brings forth some privacy issues
as well.
Director Bagley told Secretary Slater that his ability to articulately describe
what RTD is doing reflects how well in tune he is with the agency’s work.
He thanked Secretary Slater for his comments regarding unity as a Board.
Director Bagley noted that there may be disagreements but once a decision
is made the Board needs to be supportive of the decision. Director Bagley
said that the Board is pleased to have Secretary Slater as a contributor to
the Squire Patton Boggs team, giving RTD great confidence in working with
them.

what ends up happening. He said that the last time the gas tax was
increased was in 1993. In 1998 the gas tax was taken out of the general
fund and placed in the trust fund. Secretary Slater said that the key is to
keep all the options on the table. He said that the President is challenging
Congress to think big and long term.

Committee Chair Folska said that as a blind person the promise of a selfdriving car sounds very nice. She said that she had a professor who said
that one day we will all wonder why we allowed humans to drive.
Committee Chair Folska and Director Francone presented Secretary Slater
with a DUS plaque as a token of the Board’s appreciation for his attendance
and comments.

Phil Washington, General Manager, noted that RTD made a presentation on
FasTracks and Base System at the Joint Transportation Committee at the Capitol
last week. Directors Archuleta, Folska, Francone, James, and Tobiassen were in
attendance. One of the questions was regarding the public engagement on the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). The question was responded to in writing
and the Board was copied on the reply.

B. Updates

• 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Update
Committee Chair James noted that this evening’s meeting would take place
in a different order than normal, with Updates being presented first. He
explained that the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Update would provide
some valuable background for the Recommended Action the Board would be
voting on.
Stan Szabelak, Manager of Civil Engineering, reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the February 3, 2015
Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet. He said that the
presentation will consist of an update on the annual maintenance followed
by the upcoming reconstruction plan. Stan Szabelak commented that the
maintenance activity occurs within the entire granite paver portion of the
16th Street Mall while the reconstruction is scheduled to occur on blocks 1,
2 and 13.
Stan Szabelak stated that future annual expenses for RTD’s maintenance are
projected to exceed $1 million. He explained that the walkway elements

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lasater was absent.

6.B

and pavers are maintained by the Downtown Denver Partnership while RTD
only maintains the transitway pavers. He stressed that annual maintenance
costs will only continue to increase.

Stan Szabelak commented that reconstruction of the intersecting streets
was not included in the initial FTA grant application; however, CCD has
since approached RTD about entering into an Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) to use the same contractor for both projects. He said that RTD was
able to include the intersection reconstruction in with our design portion but
do not have enough funds for the actual construction. He explained that
CCD would be paying for this, which is what the IGA the Board will be
asked to vote on tonight will outline.
Director Lubow noted a settlement that was referenced on slide 4. She
asked if staff could provide further details related to the settlement. Stan
Szabelak explained that back in the mid-80s it was determined that there
were problems with the original design. The case eventually went to court
where it was confirmed that there were some issues; as a result of the court
determination, RTD received funding of about $120K per year through 2012
to offset the maintenance costs. He pointed out the settlement has barely
scratched the surface in the maintenance costs since about the mid-90s.
Director Lubow commented that the FTA request was originally for about
$16 million and we only received around $10 million. She wonders how we
accommodate being $6 million short for funding. Stan Szabelak said that
the design was completed for the full 3.5 block reconstruction and we will
try to reconstruct as much as the $10 million will allow. Rick Clarke,
Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, noted that we actually need
a great deal more than just the $6 million we were not awarded as part of
the grant application since reconstruction of the entire 16th Street Mall
granite pavers was project to cost around $63 million in 2011. He stated
that staff continues to look for grant opportunities and funding partners.
Director Lubow expressed concern that the reconstruction needs to be
completed within a few years for safety reasons. Rick Clarke explained that
it was really due to the continued, escalating maintenance costs more so
than safety.
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Stan Szabelak shared that the reconstruction cost estimate in 2011 was
projected to be $63 million for 15.5 blocks or $4.07 million per block. He
explained that based on this estimate RTD and the City and County of
Denver (CCD) applied for an FTA grant requesting $16.1 million to
reconstruct 3.5 blocks. RTD and CCD were approved for $10 million with
80% coming from the FTA ($8 million) and a 20% local match ($2 million)
being shared between RTD and CCD.

6.B

Director Solano shared a conversation he had with a gentleman who
previously had a contract with RTD to maintain the granite pavers. He said
this gentleman expressed that really the transitway should be a continuous
concrete surface to avoid the constant maintenance. Stan Szabelak said
that was Mr. Montoya; he stated that Mr. Montoya was correct. He
explained that staff tried to advocate for replacing the transitway with
concrete that would be aesthetically pleasing but there was tremendous
pushback from a variety of sources, especially those that wanted to
maintain the historic and archeological aspect of the mall. He pointed out
that even with concrete there would still be maintenance costs as that is
just the nature of roads.
Committee Chair James informed the Board that there is a 16th Street Mall
Steering Committee. This committee is a good example of collaboration
with CCD, the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) and RTD working
together to use the 16th Street Mall as effectively as possibly. He shared
that he has been a Co-Chair of the Steering Committee so is very familiar
with the discussion that have taken place. In 2010 there was a very large
amount of stakeholder input that was obtained and the historic value of the
Mall’s design was very important; that is one of the big reasons for the
reconstruction having such a large budget.
Director Francone inquired if the maintenance costs were escalating due to
the age of the Mall as opposed to something else. She also asked for a
more detailed explanation of the bulbouts referenced on slide 10 related to
RTD’s responsibility. Stan Szabelak noted RTD’s contribution would be the
darker grey area of the drawing which is funded by the grant plus local
match. This does include construction of the bulbouts. CCD would be
responsible for the typical intersection, which is light grey in the drawing.
Committee Chair James expressed that it was his understanding that the
16th Street Mall reconstruction and intersection reconstruction would be
through a single contractor. Stan Szabelak stated that was the plan. Staff
and CCD would like to have the construction be done through one contract
to take advantage of economies of scale; that is why staff will be asking for
the approval of the IGA with CCD next. Rick Clarke noted that having the
Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow observed that the IGA stated that CCD would reimburse
RTD for all direct costs associated with the construction of the intersections.
She wondered what would be considered an indirect cost. Stan Szabelak
said that direct costs would be all costs related to the construction of the
intersections; the indirect costs are the costs related to the design work that
were absorbed through the design activity that we were already engaged in
to reconstruct the granite pavers.

6.B

Director Bagley inquired what type of grant was awarded for the
reconstruction efforts. He wondered if perhaps RTD should begin to look at
submitting another grant application as there is still about another $48
million needed to complete the entire reconstruction Project. Stan Szabelak
said the grant was an FTA “Bus & Bus Facilities Livability Grant.” Rick
Clarke stated that staff is always looking for grant opportunities that this
project might qualify for. Stan Szabelak shared that there is a new grant
application that staff is currently working on and should be submitted in the
near future.
Director Hoy commented that in a sense, RTD is its own worst enemy
because our vehicles are what are causing a lot of this maintenance. He
wondered if having new vehicles with dual tires will have a positive impact
on the amount of pavers that need to be repaired, replaced, etc. Stan
Szabelak said it would lessen the impact but it is difficult to analyze and
have a definitive answer as to how much. He does not believe it will have
enough of an impact to significantly extend the life of the 16th Street Mall in
any way.
Director Menten stated that she has never been happy with this program.
She believes maintaining the granite pavers is a tremendous waste of
money, especially when RTD is cutting service in areas that really need it.
She said that she would be voting no on the IGA but would like to get
further information on what it would cost to pave the Mall with concrete
instead of the granite pavers. Henry Stopplecamp reminded the Board that
the approval of the IGA with CCD is not related to the reconstruction of the
16th Street Mall or the maintenance of the granite pavers. The action this
evening would be an IGA to tie CCD’s work into RTD’s construction
contract. Director Menten stated she understood the details related to the
request to enter into the IGA with CCD. Rick Clarke said that staff would
provide Director Menten with a rough estimate of reconstructing the Mall
with concrete.
Director Folska recognized that the 16th Street Mall is an area that brings a
great deal of pride and joy to not only people in the District, but tourists as
well. Director Folska believes that it is a very pretty architectural piece
designed by I.M. Pei; however, it is also very dysfunctional. The pavers are
very slippery and dangerous. She asked for clarification as to RTD’s
responsibility and what other organizations might be contributing to the Mall.
She also wonders if the Mall was really designed for the amount of traffic
we are running on it now. Stan Szabelak stated that RTD’s responsibility by
agreement is to maintain the transitway lanes to the extent of keeping the
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

construction occur under one contract would also minimize the traffic
impact.

6.B

Director Folska asked for information about who was responsible for the
cost of the reconstruction of the 16th Street Mall, not the maintenance. She
said that based on the information presented it was her understanding that
the Downtown Denver Partnership has not contributed any funding. Rick
Clarke explained that for the reconstruction there is a $10 million grant with
RTD contributing one-third of the required 20% local match. Henry
Stopplecamp stated that would be about $660K. Stan Szabelak reiterated
that the $10 million grant would only build about 2.5 to 3.5 blocks, not the
entire length of the Mall.
General Manager Washington stated that in regards to if the Mall was
designed to sustain its current traffic levels the answer is no. This is the
same thing being experienced with infrastructure across the country.
Director Solano inquired again why the Mall was not being reconstructed
with concrete. He recognized that there are many stamped concrete options
that can be just as aesthetically pleasing but last longer than granite pavers.
He wondered if perhaps this had really been considered. Stan Szabelak
reiterated that staff had tried to approach the switch to stamped concrete
from a technical perspective but the community wanted to continue to use
granite pavers from a historical perspective. He believes that until there is a
politically willed transition there will be no change in the pavers.
Committee Chair James stressed that a major reason for continuing to use
the granite pavers is historic preservation since the 16th Street Mall is
considered a historic landmark.
Director Menten thanked staff and Committee Chair James for providing her
with information on the groups that want to keep the granite pavers. She
said that she would be directing constituents who had concerns about fares
and eliminated routes to these organizations in the future.

C. Recommended Actions

• 16th Street Mall Intersection Improvements, Funding Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City and County of Denver
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and

Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

pavers repaired, replaced, etc. He said that we are not responsible for snow
removal or any maintenance of the sidewalk area. Rick Clarke noted that
RTD recently entered into an agreement with CCD in which they will
contribute up to $300K per year to support transitway maintenance.

6.B

County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The
purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of
CCD and RTD to construct intersection improvements within the CCD
Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16 th Street Mall Reconstruction
Project. The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the
construction managed by RTD.
Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Anderson stated that what RTD is working with is the
built environment; if the 16th Street Mall were to be designed
today it would be completely different. She reiterated that the
community has spent a great deal of time working with RTD,
the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the historical society
and communities. She believes that all RTD can do today is
work to reconstruct the Mall while keeping in line with its
historical preservation until there is a political change. She
said she supports this motion because RTD cannot redesign
the mall today or in the near future but it still needs to be
maintained.
Rick Clarke reminded the Board that this IGA allows RTD to
enter into an agreement with CCD so that RTD can use CCD’s
funds to reconstruct the intersections. Stan Szabelak
informed the Board that once all the bids are received, staff
will come back to the Board for approval of the construction
contract.
Director Walker explained that he supports this motion
because it is combining efforts. Instead of having to disrupt
traffic and impact businesses and commuters multiple times,
this completes everything at once. He said that he also
supports the bulbouts as they make it much safer for
pedestrians to cross the street.
Director Francone stated that she does not want to belabor
the point, but the community is interested in preserving the
historical value of the 16th Street Mall while RTD’s
commitment is to preserve the roadway. She believes that,
when looking at the soaring maintenance costs, RTD should
have the political will to redesign the Mall in a manner that will

Committee Chair James commented that the granite pavers
within the Mall are really what cause the large reconstruction
expense. The intersection reconstruction does not consist of
granite pavers so it will not be as expensive. He inquired if
the design of the intersection was a result of collaboration
with RTD, CCD and the Downtown Denver Partnership and
therefore the Mall design and intersection design will
complement each other. Stan Szabelak stated that was
correct.

explained that the lessons learned from this project could be
implemented at another intersection down the road.

B. Recommended Actions

• Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental Immunity and Purchase of
Insurance for the BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro Rail Line
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of
sovereign immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase
insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the BNSF Railway company
(BNSF) for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to
be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL, including but not
limited to
environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out
of the use of automobiles, worker protection claims including those for
railroad worker’s arising under the Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA);
and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the Resolution shall be the
limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that RTD is acquiring
property and entering into a Construction and Maintenance
Agreement with BNSF for approximately 2.5 miles of right of
way on the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL). Since RTD and
BNSF trains will operate in close proximity to one another,
BNSF will not sell property for the use of passenger rail and
thereby increase its exposure to risk without indemnification.
She stated that Federal law limits liability for passenger rail
accidents to $200 million per occurrence at the present time,
and state law limits exposure to punitive damages for both
RTD and BNSF. Marla Lien said that RTD must acquire and
maintain insurance in the amounts outlined in the resolution,
subject to review by RTD and BNSF approximately every five
years, as a condition of RTD operations. She pointed out that
if RTD fails to obtain and maintain insurance and indemnify
BNSF, RTD may be precluded from operations in the shared
portion of the corridor. She added that this must be made in
resolution form in compliance with Colorado law. Marla Lien
stated that this type of resolution has been done with every
FasTracks corridor.

C. Updates

• North Metro Rail Line Update
Ashland Vaughn, North Metro Rail Line Project Manager, and Ron Enserro
North Metro Rail Line Design Manager, reviewed the North Metro Rail Line
(NMRL) Update presentation included in the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee meeting packet for February 3, 2015. The presentation included
a review of the NMRL, major project elements such as tenant relocation,
construction update, community outreach, design progress and schedule,
stakeholders and partners, and platform configuration.
Ashland Vaughn noted the presence of Mike Salmon and Shawn Plichta,
representatives from Regional Rail Partners (RRP). NMRL Public Information

staff was present earlier in the evening but unfortunately had to leave due to
other commitments.

Committee Chair Hoy said that he has had conversations with staff and
crews. He pointed out that all the Directors in the corridor, including
Directors Anderson, Lubow, Solano, and himself, are very excited to see the
progress on the NMRL.
Director Folska noted how exciting the update on the NMRL is since it will
be finished in 2018 as opposed to a longer term project. She asked Rick
Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, to explain any
2015 developments with RRP funding to Highway 7. Rick Clarke replied
that RTD has an option for construction through December, 2015 if we
want to exercise it. He said that currently it is not funded so staff will be
revisiting its status throughout 2015. Director Folska asked what the total
construction cost was to fund to Highway 7. Rick Clarke answered that it
was $180 million. Director Folska pointed out that if construction was to
begin while the current construction is happening it would be cheaper to
take advantage of the current construction crews. She asked if the
Southeast (SE) expansion and its stakeholder’s partnership has been
mentioned as an example to the stakeholders in the NMRL area. Rick Clarke
said that the stakeholders are aware of the SE collaboration and agreed that
utilizing current construction crews would be more economic. Committee
Chair Hoy noted that he has mentioned those same comments to staff. Phil
Washington, General Manager, explained that the Graham option to exercise
expires at the end of 2015. This is different from their demobilization at the
end of construction in 2018. Staff will want to find funds before the
demobilization. Director Bagley reminded the Directors that it would require
10 votes to move forward with the NMRL extension.
Director Bagley noted that the proposed Park-n-Ride at 124th has 166
surface parking spaces and 741 garage parking spaces. He asked what the
cost of the parking garage will be. Ashland Vaughn replied that staff does
not have set numbers since the project is in the design phase but the
average is $15-$18 thousand a space. Director Bagley estimated the total
at just under $15 million. Rick Clarke added that total would be offset by
the value add engineering. Director Bagley said he understood the offset.
He added that this reminded him of the Wadsworth and Sheridan Park-nRides. Currently they are underutilized, at 20-25% and 15% capacity
respectively. He noted that he knew that these were constructed looking at
Packet Pg. 22

Committee Chair Hoy stated that Ashland Vaughn was being modest when
explaining the tenant relocation as he just mentioned it. Committee Chair
Hoy said that project was a big job that Ashland Vaughn worked hard to get
done.

6.C

Director Tobiassen said that while attending the Joint Legislative
Transportation Committee, Pueblo seemed to be the source of steel for
different projects. He recently read an article on the boom of the
manufacturing companies in Pueblo. Director Tobiassen wondered where
the concrete for RTD projects would come from. Ashland Vaughn said that
there are no procured ties yet, but it would probably be Pueblo.
Director Solano expressed his confusion regarding the funding from the
current end of line at 124th and the future end of line at Highway 7. We
wondered if that part of the corridor was going to be federally funded. Rick
Clarke clarified that that part of the corridor originally was going to be a
Federal project but it was later decided to be a locally funded. Director
Solano asked if there were any plans to pursue Federal funds for that part of
the corridor. He said his concern was restarting the bureaucracy process.
Rick Clarke replied that that part of the corridor does not meet the criteria
for federal funds. Ashland Vaughn added that in order for the corridor to
qualify it would need a bigger environmental statement.
Director Menten noted that the design for the NMRL is at 60% completion.
She pointed out all the design improvements that have had to be done and
still need to happen on the West Corridor, especially at the Federal Center.
She asked staff if the lessons learned from the West Corridor were being
taken into consideration on the NMRL design. She also wondered if disabled
groups, such as the Colorado Center for the Blind, have been brought in to
revise the design. Ashland Vaughn replied that “lessons learned” is part of
the daily vocabulary of the project. He added that Denver Transit Partners,
RTD Rail Operations, and other groups are reviewing the designs as the
project moves forward. He pointed out that no one from the disabled
community has been involved in the process so far but he thinks this will be
important as the design moves along. Director Menten suggested staff
reach out to Jadwiga Brown, Orientation and Mobility Specialist/Vision
Rehabilitation Therapist at the State of Colorado, as she has offered to share
her knowledge in this area. Ashland Vaughn will follow up with Director
Menten to get Ms. Brown’s contact information.

• Southeast Rail Extension Qualifications
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

2030 utilization; however, these Park-n-Rides starting from scratch have not
yet taken off. He compared it to the Arvada Park-n-Ride in Director
Anderson’s District, noting that there is an active Park-n-Ride and utilization
culture. He pointed out that when using the West Corridor as experience,
the 124th Park-n-Ride does not look good. Committee Chair Hoy added that
constituents with complaints on the Wagon Road Park-n-Ride may find the
proposed Eastlake Park-n-Ride useful.

Pranaya Shrestha, Senior Manager for Program Management, explained that
the Southeast Rail Extension procurement process has two phases: Request
for Qualifications (RFQ) followed by Request for Proposal (RFP). He said
that the RFQ was sent out on November 19, 2014. Seven firms replied:
 Balfour Beatty Infrastructure with Parson Brinkerhoff
 Graham – Kraemer Joint Venture with Modern Railway Systems and
Stantec
 Kiewit with Mass Electric and Hatch Mott McDonald
 Stacy Witbeck – Herzog – Wadsworth Joint Venture with Modern
Railway Systems and STV
 PCL with CH2M Hill and RailWorks Project, Inc.
 Flatiron with Hamon Contractors and Huiit-Zollars, Inc.
 AECOM with Aldridge Electric and G.W. Peoples Contracting
Pranaya Shrestha added that all companies have previous RTD experience.
He said that the RFQ covered areas such as how they intend to meet the
project goals, their experience, organization of key personal, project
management, and approach to WIN/DBE/SBE, among others.
Andy Mutz, Engineering Project Manager, explained that the selection team
consisted of seven RTD staff members. They all scored and measured
qualifications individually. They met together last week. Four teams stood
out. They will be sent an RFP:
 Balfour Beatty Infrastructure with Parson Brinkerhoff
 Graham – Kraemer Joint Venture with Modern Railway Systems and
Stantec
 Kiewit with Mass Electric and Hatch Mott McDonald
 Stacy Witbeck – Herzog – Wadsworth Joint Venture with Modern
Railway Systems and STV
Andy Mutz outlined the next steps:
 End of February: RFP to the four teams
 Early April: Comments and questions due
 End of April: Responses due
 Mid-May: RFPs due
 June: Staff recommendation
 Early 2016: Construction starts
Phil Washington, General Manager, noted that RTD is moving forward
aggressively with not just the SE extension but all of FasTracks. He hopes
to break ground on the SE extension by the fall of 2015. He noted the
importance of not only being on the President’s budget, but also being paid
$92 million all at once in one fiscal year, which is very unusual. He
reminded the Directors of Former Secretary of Transportation Rodney
Slater’s comments during the Government Relations Committee earlier that

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 3, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.C

Director Bagley thanked Phil Washington for his comment on speaking with
one voice. Director Bagley recalled that the SE extension vote was very
close at 10-4. He added that $92 million is a very significant amount. He
noted that towns and private entities are investing $35-$40 million with $25
million of it in cash and the rest in such forms as right of way. He said that
even though the SE extension is not in his District, he is in communication
with the Denver South Economic Partnership and imagines they will be very
happy with the Federal funding. Director Bagley thanked the staff for their
work as well as Secretary Slater and Squire Patton Boggs for their work at
the Federal level.
Chair Sisk echoed Director Bagley’s remarks and thanked staff for their
work. Chair Sisk wondered what kind of engagement the SE stakeholders
would have throughout the bidding process, hoping that they would still be
part of that conversation. Phil Washington replied that the SE stakeholders
will be part of the process.
Committee Chair Hoy noted how the SE extension project is a great
opportunity to think regionally. RTD will write a check for $60-$70 million
and the end result will be a project worth $200 million. He said that the
northern constituency, although perhaps begrudgely understands that it is
very hard to bypass a deal like that. Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that
the SE community is willing to invest $35-$40 million. He does not know if
the northern stakeholders have that ability, but at least hopes that the SE
extension project will grab their attention and maybe RTD will see some kind
of participation. Director Bagley added that local stakeholders adding “skin
to the game” makes a big difference.

D. Other Matters
Director Solano thanked Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for
Communications and Pauletta Tonilas, Senior Manager for Public Relations and
Public Information, for helping set up the Commerce City Town Hall with Senator
Ulibarri.

evening. Secretary Slater mentioned that RTD was included in the
President’s budget due to its efficiency in delivering projects on time or
earlier, within or under budget, and leadership speaking in one voice. Phil
Washington reminded the Directors of the discussion to add the SE
extension to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) plan.
This discussion ended on a divided vote. However, moving the SE extension
to the DRCOG plan was what allowed the Federal funding through the
President’s budget. Phil Washington added that staff deserves credit for
their work on the SE extension.

Director Menten noted that on the General Manager’s report there was a mention to
the Request for Information for 16 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses. She said that
she thought a supplier had been picked already given the context of the
presentation by Nadine Lee, Engineering Project Manager for US36 at another
committee meeting. Phil Washington, General Manager, explained that the first
BRT buses that will be used for US36 will be over the road coaches from MCI.
These buses are not true BRT buses: they are not low floor, only one door, etc. He
explained that the ideal BRT vehicle is a low floor bus with 2 doors. RTD is not in a
position to create the custom vehicles. RTD is working with stakeholders to use
the current buses and to replace them with true BRT vehicles the next time a fleet
of buses is set to retire. He clarified that staff is evaluating the Request for
Information on services and supplies.
Phil Washington informed the Directors that RTD will be hosting a delegation of 4
from Costa Rica on February 17th and 18th. The delegation will include the Costa
Rica Rail Minister and the US Ambassador to Costa Rica. Phil Washington added
that Chair Sisk will be addressing the delegation.
Phil Washington updated the Board on the receipt of an unsolicited proposal to
monetize parking at RTD facilities. The unsolicited proposal process includes a
period of time to study the proposal and determine whether it has financial or
technical merit. Staff will come back to the Board with a recommendation within
30-45 days. If it has one of those two qualifications, staff would then seek a
decision from the Board on whether to solicit an RFP.
Director Folska thought that unsolicited proposals would only be entertained for real
property. She asked Phil Washington to clarify the policy. Phil Washington replied
that the unsolicited proposal policy was revised in 2011 to encourage the private
sector to come up with their ideas. This change aided in the development of
Private Public Partnerships (P3s). This also helped in furthering the I-225 and North
Metro projects. RTD’s Transit Oriented Community Department is working on
developing an unsolicited proposal policy for real estate, which is not covered by
current policy. This will be brought to the Board in the next month. Director Folska
asked Phil Washington to explain the unsolicited proposal process. Phil Washington
said that staff will review an unsolicited proposal for technical or financial merit. If
it has either one of those, then an RFP would be placed to look at it competitively.
If it doesn’t have either technical of financial merit, the proposal is not pursued.
Phil Washington added that if the proposal is found to have merit, staff will be
looking for a head nod from the Directors in order to move forward with the RFP.
Committee Chair Hoy asked how many times the Board will be able to process the
proposal. Phil Washington said that he envisions an executive session to go over
what is allowed to be discussed from the proposals. Staff would look for a head
nod to craft the RFP, which would be brought to the Board before being released.
Phil Washington added that it takes about 5 to 6 months to write an RFP. Staff

would only want to write an RFP if the Board agrees to it. Committee Chair Hoy
said that 5 to 6 months answered his question.
Phil Washington pointed out that Former Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater
has been very impressed with the work RTD is doing. Phil Washington said that
Secretary Slater does not interface much with RTD’s work at Squire Patton Boggs,
but he is genuinely interested in keeping informed. He said that Secretary Slater
was genuine in his remarks to the Board during the Government Relations
Committee meeting earlier in the evening.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Division- 2014 Annual Report
Zamy Silva, Acting Senior Manager for Civil Rights, thanked the Directors for
the opportunity to present the Civil Rights Department highlights for 2014.
The Civil Rights 2014 Annual Report was included in the February 10, 2015
Civil Rights Committee Agenda packet. A hard copy of the Annual Report
was available for each Director during the meeting. Zamy Silva thanked
Adrina Gibson, Compliance Officer, and Mica Maniece, Workforce Initiative
Now (WIN) Specialist, for their work on the Annual Report.
Zamy Silva and Martell Dyles, WIN Program Manager, reviewed the
presentation included in the February 10, 2015 Civil Rights Committee
Agenda packet. The presentation included an overview of the 2014 Annual
Report, an overview of the 2014 events conducted and attended, and the
2015 goals for the division.
Director Folska commended Zamy Silva and the Civil Rights Department for
their work and passion. She asked if any disabled-owned businesses were
accounted for on the spreadsheet with the information from the Census
Bureau on the Annual Report. Zamy Silva replied that the spreadsheet is
meant to be a look at Colorado’s composition when it comes to
Disadvantage Business Enterprises (DBE) and Small Business Enterprises
(SBE) certified businesses. No line item represents disable-owned

businesses. Director Folska hopes that moving forward in 2015 the disabled
business community would be included in every aspect of RTD operations.
Phil Washington, General Manager, added that there is no Federal category
to track Americans with Disability Act (ADA) businesses but staff will look
into identifying and tracking these businesses.

Director Menten asked if RTD did certifications as she was under the
impression that the City and County of Denver (Denver) was responsible for
them. Zamy Silva replied that Denver does the DBE certification. RTD
opted to create its own SBE certification program. RTD is responsible for
certification and monitoring these locally funded projects.
Director Menten mentioned that she met with Dennis Gallagher, City Auditor
for the City and County of Denver (Denver). They measure success by how
many firms graduate from their program. Director Menten asked how RTD
measures success. Zamy Silva said that Denver’s DBE certification program
is different: once a business has a 3 year revenue average sales greater than
$23.98 million they graduate from the DBE Program. RTD’s certification has
a 4 category system in which similarly sized businesses are placed in the
same category. The idea is that firms of the same size are competing with
each other for the same projects. Director Menten wondered if firms stay
within their categories for an extended period of time. Phil Washington
replied that it is considered a success when firms move to the next revenue
category. The top category will be changed to $23 million in accordance
with new Federal DBE regulations. He added that no firm working with RTD
has reached that level in the past 12 months. The Civil Right Department
actively monitors the certifications. Director Menten asked if the number of
employees affects the category placement. Zamy Silva answered that
Federal regulations look at different things depending on the industry. For
example they will look at the average 3 year revenue for engineering firms.
For supplier and manufacturer firms, Federal guidelines look at the average 3
year revenue, size of company, and personal net worth of the socially
disadvantage individual. She added that the intent of the program is to have
firms graduate. She pointed out that some firms do not want to graduate as
they may lose business once they lose their certification. Sometimes firms
pass on jobs in order to remain at their current level. Director Menten noted
that it may be because RTD is providing them with the fish and they do not
want to pick up the fishing rod.
Director Deadwyler said that she was under the impression that RTD did
dual certifications for DBE and SBE. Zamy Silva clarified that there are two
individual certifications: the DBE certification through Denver and the
Packet Pg. 30

Director Solano wondered if the Equal Opportunity (EO) videos referred to in
the Annual Report were produced in house. Zamy Silva replied that they
were and that most of them were recordings of classes.

Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and RTD’s SBE certification.
Those that qualify for DBE most likely will qualify for SBE. Firms that are
certified for both have the opportunity to participate in both locally and
federally funded projects. Director Deadwyler expressed that she was still
confused. She understands there are two separate programs. She
wondered if it is an automatic graduation if a DBE/SBE gets awarded both a
DBE and an SBE contract. Zamy Silva said that this was not necessarily the
case. Many firms that are both DBE and SBE participated in the West
Corridor and are currently participating in the Eagle P3 project. She noted
that maximizing opportunities does not necessarily mean that they will
graduate from the program; it does provide for more project prospects. Phil
Washington replied that graduation happens when the 3 year average
revenue surpasses $23 million in annual revenue. Having both DBE and SBE
work would not necessarily take them over the threshold. Director
Deadwyler asked if firms are then considered prime/large business if they
cross over the $23 million. Zamy Silva replied that a firm that crosses the
$23 million threshold loses their SBE certification. She noted that firms that
may have started working on FasTracks as a category 1 are now at a 2 or 3
level.
Committee Chair Walker pointed out that it may be possible that some
businesses would not want to grow as they may enjoy the pace of a small
business. He wondered if it has been harder to attract WIN participants
since the economy started bouncing back. He noted the common place
notion that good employees are hard to come by during a good economy.
Martell Dyles said that enrollment has picked up. Many seem to want to
grow with the economy. Committee Chair Walker asked if people were
looking for a specific type of position. Martell Dyles replied that there is
interest in all types of positions. Staff steers applicants toward transit
positions. He mentioned that some construction participants are
transitioning into transit as construction projects come to completion.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 64 - 40' Transit Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. in an
amount not to exceed $27,500,000 for the purchase of 64 additional 40’
transit buses and associated spare components.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that this is really a housekeeping item. He explained
that this is the third year in which RTD has been working to
replace our 40’ transit buses through a phased approach. The
fleet being replaced is from 2000, so they have reached the
end of their useful life.
Director Bagley noted that since this is the third year of the
phased program, he wondered what staff’s experience has
been during the first two years. Bruce Abel said that it had

Packet Pg. 34

Chair Sisk inquired what happens to the buses that are taken
out of service. Bruce Abel explained that when the vehicles
are taken out of service, per RTD’s procurement policy, they
are taken to auction. RTD has a contract with Roller Auctions.
Chair Sisk wondered what RTD received for the buses that
might have been auctioned in 2014. Steve Gieske stated the
average was around $5K per vehicle.
Director Walker pointed out that RTD was currently
considering new fare options as part of the Fare Study, such
as being able to purchase a day pass on the buses. He asked
if this type of equipment could be installed on these buses to
accept a payment form different from today or print tickets.
Bruce Abel stated that staff did not anticipate any problems in
terms of being able to install new equipment depending on the
outcome of the Fare Study. He noted that there have been
issues related to space for mobility devices such as walkers.
He said that staff is working with the manufacturer to address
this issue.
Director Archuleta wondered what percentage of the total sale
price Roller Auctions charged for auctioning the vehicles.
General Manager Washington stated that there is a standard
fee that Roller Auctions charges but he does not know the
exact amount offhand. Staff said they would send him the
amount.
Director Solano inquired as to the rate of inflation since RTD
purchased our last buses over 12 years ago. Lou Ha, Manager
of Technical Services, stated that it has been very low at an
average of about 1-2% per year.
Director James commented that while it was a little off topic,
he was wondering if staff could provide him with an update on
the procurement for the new 16th street Mall buses offline.
Director Francone asked for the approximate cost per bus.
Steve Gieske stated it was around $423K per vehicle.
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

been a very positive experience, thus staff was recommending
that RTD exercise the option to purchase additional vehicles
rather than go out for a new procurement. Steve Gieske,
General Superintendent of Maintenance, shared that RTD has
received about 125 buses with 110 being in service. He
stated that it has been a better than expected experience.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in an amount not to
exceed $12,300,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 18
additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel noted that, as with the 40’ transit buses, this is
the third year of a phased replacement of the 60’ articulated
buses.
Director Solano asked where in the system the new buses
would be utilized. Bruce Abel explained that the size of bus
assigned to each route is based on passenger load.
Articulated buses are typically used on routes that have
heavier passenger loads such at the 15L. He said that virtually
every garage will receive some of the new buses as they are
purchased.
Director Folska wondered how different these articulated
buses are as compared to the Free Metro Ride buses. She
also asked how much the Free Metro Ride buses cost per
vehicle. Bruce Abel explained that the Free Metro Ride buses
come at a slight premium due to modifications such as a third
door and different seating configuration. Steve Gieske said
the buses for the Free Metro Ride cost right around $700K.
Director Folska inquired how many Free Metro Ride buses
were purchased and if they were used for other services

Director Francone asked staff for the breakdown of the cost
per bus for purchasing the articulated buses. Steve Gieske
stated that the 40’ transit buses are $423K, the 60’
articulated buses are $670K and the Free Metro Ride buses
are $700K. Director Francone noted that if she does the math
the cost per vehicle does not equal the $12.3 million
requested. Steve Gieske explained that there are other spare
components that RTD will be purchasing as well.

• Board Report May 2015 Service Change
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the May 2015 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A and, further, to authorize the
General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes
Motion:

Director James made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that staff presented them with
a draft recommendation last month. He said that staff has
since taken the recommendations out for public comment.
During the process of public comment and through continued
analysis there were adjustments made that were highlighted in
yellow. He asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning
and Scheduling, to review the process and changes in further
detail.

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

throughout the system. Steve Gieske said that 12 buses were
purchased. Bruce Abel stated that the Free Metro Ride buses
were only used for the 18th/19th Circulator service.

Jessie Carter noted that there were five public hearings with
about 60 participants, which is a very good turnout for RTD
public hearings. He said the largest meeting was in the
Westwood neighborhood where there were over 30
participants all praising the return of the Route 4. The second
largest was in Louisville where the Route DD is proposed for
cancellation. He stated that there were 15 people in
attendance, all opposed to the cancellation. He said the
modifications to the proposed service changes were mostly
minor adjustments to improve on-time performance or
connectivity. Staff is recommending the addition of two early
morning AT trips due to overcrowding.
Director Deadwyler said that in reading the comments it seems
there are a lot of people opposed to the cancellation of Route
DD. She expressed concern that this will cause quite a bit
more travel time with several connections if this route is
cancelled. Bruce Abel explained that staff hoped the Route
DD could be maintained until the VA completed its relocation;
however, since the relocation of the University of Colorado
Medical School and a variety of other medical services,
ridership has decreased drastically. Bruce Abel stated that
based on current ridership, staff feels that this is a very nonproductive use of RTD’s resources. He believes that the small
number of riders would be better served by working with
DRCOG and 36 Commuting Solutions to create some vanpool,
which can be more tailored to the riders’ needs. Jessie Carter
pointed out that the level of subsidy for Route DD is over $18
per boarding. He said that compared to an average regional
subsidy per boarding of $4 Route DD is almost 5 times as
high. He stated that this is one of the major reasons this route
is being discontinued. He reiterated that it is very difficult to
justify providing this service when RTD is challenged to
provide adequate capacity for exceptionally well performing
routes.
Director Deadwyler noted that the recommendation indicates
that the General Manager or his designee may execute
contract amendments as necessary with RTD’s private
operators. She wonders if this would affect any of our
Access-a-Ride private contractors. Bruce Abel stated that
RTD has contracts with First Transit and Veolia to provide
certain fixed route services. He said that the contract
amendments would only relate to those contracts.

Director Francone pointed out that there are minor trip
adjustments being proposed for the Route 77, 401, 402, and
403. She asked if staff could elaborate on the adjustments.
Jessie Carter stated that there is a proposed change to the CLine schedule. He explained that due to this change, staff is
recommending adjustments to certain bus routes that connect
with the C-Line so they continue to make their connections.

Director Hoy inquired if Route DD had 12 riders per hour,
meaning that there were actually 18 passengers on the bus.
He commented that every rider of that service must have
submitted feedback opposing the cancellation based on the
number of people we have heard from. Jessie Carter stated
that the information provided were trip specific, meaning there
would be significantly less than 12 riders per hour. He said it
was not unusual to hear multiple times from riders when their
route is up for discontinuance.
Director Archuleta asked for confirmation that Route 4 would
be returning. Bruce Abel stated that the reinstatement of
Route 4 was included in the recommendation.
Chair Sisk pointed out that one of the suggestions for Route
DD was having one morning and one afternoon trip. He
inquired if staff had evaluated this suggestion to determine if it
was feasible. Jessie Carter stated that while it is feasible, it is
not a practical solution. Bruce Abel noted that this really goes
back to vanpools. He explained that by only having one
departure and return time would provide no flexibility;
however, forming vanpools would provide the opportunity for
more personalized service for the riders.
Chair Sisk stated that he supports cancelling Route DD even
though it affects Boulder because it makes sense from an RTD
perspective. He hopes that staff will assist 36 Commuting
Solutions and DRCOG in establishing vanpools for the riders.
Director Menten wondered why service on Route 16 needed to
be terminated at 10th and Broadway to allow for use of a
suitable operator restroom. She asked why the schedule did
not just allow for a break at that location instead. Director
Menten also inquired how RTD addresses the needs for

C. Updates

• Proposed US 36 Service Plan
Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, reviewed a Power
Point with the Board that is available in the February 10, 2015 Operations
and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. He explained that
currently there are 12 existing regional routes along the US 36 Corridor
which is very complex and difficult for passengers to understand. Jeff
Becker stated that the proposed service plan consolidated routes, which was
easier for riders to understand while allowing RTD to take advantage of
roadway improvement. He said of particular important in the US 36 service
plan recommendation is that all of the service frequencies meet or exceed
those outlined by the US 36 Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC). The
proposed plan represents a 10.7% increase in service hours in the Corridor.
Director Hoy noted that with the exception of the proposed limited route, all
the buses would stop at the Westminster and Broomfield stations. He said if
his calculations were correct the frequency of buses stopping at those
stations would be 14 per hour or one bus every 4.5 to 5 minutes. Jeff
Becker stated that was correct but the buses stopping throughout the hour
would have different destinations.
Director Hoy asked if this was the same presentation he reviewed with Jeff
Becker several months ago. Bruce Abel said that the initial report was
provided by Transportation Management & Design, Inc., which was one of
the inputs used in development the recommended service plan. He
explained that there have been adjustments from the consultants

Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

restrooms along routes where RTD does not have facilities.
Jessie Carter explained that allowing for a break at 10th and
Broadway and then continuing the route to the old terminus
would really inconvenience the riders left waiting on the bus,
so this is the better options. He said that RTD has agreements
with various businesses along routes as needed to meet the
Collective Bargaining Agreement requirements.

6.E

General Manager Washington noted the other important consideration was
developing a true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service. He stated that true BRT
is very frequent service, often so frequent that riders do not need a
schedule. Staff is attempting to get as close to that true BRT definition as
initially possible with this service plan. General Manager Washington
pointed out that RTD is also over-subscribing with service in this plan.
There is a fine line between putting out service and the riders not responding
as opposed to having people hang out the windows. He stated that staff is
trying to balance the idea that if RTD puts out ample service the ridership
will come with sustainable service levels.
Director Hoy made the observation that Flatirons and Church Ranch have no
express stops. He wondered why as in his experience these stops have a
pretty robust group of riders. Nate Diaz, Service Planning/Scheduler, pointed
out that compared to other stops that have 1,500 boardings per day, the
ridership at Flatirons and Church Ranch seem relatively low at 200 boardings
per day. Jeff Becker commented that there are always tradeoffs but the
plan will be taken out to the public for input.
Chair Sisk thanked the staff and stakeholders for their continued dialog and
discussion. He feels the process has been very positive; however, Chair
Sisk expressed concern that we are still not where we need to be. He
recognized that BRT was promised to the Northwest area as part of
FasTracks. It was the only BRT that was part of the original plan. He is
concerned that only having a 10% increase in service hours in the
recommended plan is not keeping with RTD’s promise to the voters. He said
he looks forward to rolling up his sleeves and continuing to work with the
stakeholders.
Director Francone acknowledged that she comes from a District that is all
about the bus. She shared that she will be watching this very carefully.
She asked staff to keep her updated because a plan similar to this might be
a solution for District N as well. Director Francone requested that staff keep
State Representative Tracey Kraft-Tharp included in the public input process.
Director Francone noted that Representative Kraft-Tharp felt she had not
been included during the initial plan development.
Committee Chair Anderson stated that this is just the first of many service
plans for the openings in 2015-2016. She said that staff and the
Committee have a lot of work to do in the next year. She asked that
Directors continue to bring their questions and comments to the staff.

recommendations based on internal deliberations and feedback from
stakeholders, public, etc.

6.E

Director Lubow reminded everyone that in addition to promising BRT, RTD
also promised rail to the Northwest area.

Bruce Abel explained that the purpose of this evening’s update is not asking
for the Board’s approval of the fare study recommendations, but simply
giving the go ahead for staff to take the recommendations out for public
comment. He noted that there have been some minor modifications from
what was originally discussed with the Directors due to feedback that staff
has already received. There was concern expressed about consolidating the
express and regional service classifications so the new recommendation now
includes local, express and regional bus service. Bruce Abel stated that the
initial recommendations did not meet the fare revenue assumptions in the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for 2016 so changes were made as well.
Bruce Abel recognized that the program for agencies to get passes for low
income individuals needs to be simplified and improved; however, he
stressed that staff needs to get closure on the foundation of the fare
structure before that can be addressed. He stated that staff feels the
introduction of the Day Pass priced at the cost of a round trip ticket does
begin to address the issues of affordability.
Lacy Bell reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the February 10, 2015 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet.
General Manager Washington acknowledged the great work done by the fare
task force team. This is something that touches every part of the District
making their work extremely important. He reminded the Board that the SBP
referenced by Bruce Abel was approved by the Board in July of 2015. The
SBP has a number of assumptions over its six year period, one of which is
for fare revenue to reach $131 million in 2016. He explained that the fare
task force took this figure into consideration when determining fare structure
and level. General Manager Washington pointed out that the comment of
assuming a fare increase is not really a correct statement. What actually
happens is that a fare review is conducted every three years to determine if
an adjustment needs to be made.
General Manager Washington noted that several Directors have received
emails asking that the fare recommendation be delayed. He reiterated that
staff is simply asking to take this out for public comment so they can hear
what people think.
Bruce Abel stressed that staff recognizes they need to continue to address
affordability. He shared that in talking with many other agencies, transfers

• Fare Task Force Update

6.E

Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Board that the question before
them this evening is if staff should take the recommendation out for public
comment.
Director Folska thanked staff for their work on this monumental task. She
thinks there are a lot of merits to the Day Pass. She appreciates the
attention that staff is giving to the transit dependent; however, one of the
things that she did not hear was about the high cost of parking to the overall
cost of transportation. She had been hoping that would be part of the
calculations. Director Folska pointed out the numerous other services that
RTD supports like the Art Shuttle, vanpools, etc. She expressed concern
that our economically challenged riders are the ones subsidizing parking and
these other services that benefit those who are gainfully employed. Bruce
Abel stated that staff is continuing to look at the parking component. He
stated that it is also important to consider the subsidy cost of a local bus
someone might take to a Park-n-Ride.
Director Folska stated that she supports staff taking the recommendations
out for public comment.
Director Menten shared that she was very happen to see the changes to the
plan that benefit RTD financially. Her only comment is that her dream
figures would be $5.50 for the Day Pass at $12 for an airport ticket if the
person traveling was not an airport employee. Director Menten
acknowledged this might be a difficult task to separate out the DIA
employees from the travelers. She thanked staff for their work, recognizing
what an intense job this has been.
Director Deadwyler believes the new price structure proposed would be
devastating to many of our riders. She sees moving the fare from $2.25 per
boarding to $2.60 and not being able to transfer without buying a Day Pass
as doing more harm than good. She stated that the income level required
for people to get a pass through the agencies we work with is virtually zero.
This means that even people with minimum wage jobs do not qualify for
assistance. Director Deadwyler does not believe that things are going to
change for the people that cannot afford our service. She said that she
Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

have often had a major negative impact on fare revenue. He said it is staff’s
hope that eliminating the transfer might allow RTD to reduce fare or at least
maintain it at the proposed level. He stated that it is not staff’s desire to
come to the Board every three years for a fare increase. He commented that
many people perceive that affordability is achieved by reducing fares. He
said that quite candidly RTD cannot do this without service reductions. He
believes this begins to recognize affordability in a manner that does not
require service reductions.

6.E

Director Lubow thanked staff for all the work they have done. She said that
she has similar concerns to those of Director Deadwyler. She wonders how
this might affect a rider who really only needs one trip and a transfer. The
proposed Day Pass would now require the rider to pay for two trips, which
they might not be able to afford. She expressed that she is very concerned
for the low income riders because the Board has heard from numerous
people who are already having difficulty paying for transportation. Director
Lubow wonders if this structure is yet again making it so those that have
more money get a better break based on the discount for monthly passes.
Bruce Abel explained that the breakeven point for the pass would be if the
rider took 40 trips per month, which is up from the 36 trips needed
currently. The average commuter takes 42 trips per month.
Director Lubow wondered if the Day Pass would still be considered an option
if we received many comments that it would not be helpful to our riders.
General Manager Washington explained that this process would be just like
the process for service changes. The plan is presented to the public, they
offer suggestions or changes, staff evaluates and incorporates changes, and
then the plan will be presented to the Board again in April. General Manager
Washington stated that he anticipates there will be changes to the final
product.
Director Walker shared that he is very curious to hear what people will say.
He said that as a long time bus rider he thinks the recommendations look
good. He commented that $2.60 is a weird number as he does not often
have dimes with him. He also wonders how the Day Passes will be
monitored as those have more value than our current transfers.
Director Francone echoed other Directors concerns about low income and
transit dependent riders. She said that she has been receiving many emails
from transit dependent people who are really concerned about the fare
structure. She wonders how staff proposes to get feedback from those
populations that cannot afford to attend the public meetings. She noted
that it is not likely that they have internet to email RTD. Bruce Abel stated
that his team is working with the Public Information department to maximize
exposure but he does not have a concrete answer at this time.
Director Francone said that if her memory was correct when the SBP was
presented prior to her being a Director, ridership was projected to remain flat
through 2016. She asked if this fare increased would really meet the
Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

cannot support staff taking this out for public comment because the people
that really need to have their input heard cannot afford to get to our public
meetings. Until there is a way for these people to participate she will not
support moving forward.

6.E

desired revenues based on flat ridership. Bruce Abel stated that the models
indicate these fare rates will meet the SBP’s fare assumptions in 2016.
Director Francone asked if our surveys related to fare increase/service
reduction are conducted in an either/or type format. Bruce Abel explained
that it was presented in those terms because those are the tradeoffs that
management can control.

Director Solano shared he also is not ready for this to go out to public
comment. He said that he understands the16th Street Mall Shuttle being
free but he believes the Free Metro Ride should have some fare. This is
working people getting our service for free while the transit dependent has
to pay. Director Solano inquired what percentage of revenue would come
from fare if the local fares were increased to $2.60 today. Bruce Abel
stated that they would need to run some models but it would probably be
about a percentage higher than it is currently.
Director Bagley commented that most of the Directors today were not on
the Board in 2011 when RTD had some significant revenue shortfalls. The
Board at that time approved cutting service by over $10 million. He stated
that is something that no one wants to do again. He noted that in the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting the Board will hear
that fare revenue for 2014 is down compared to the budget. Director
Bagley stated this is something for the Directors to keep in mind as they
review the fare recommendation; it is very important that any changes are at
least revenue neutral.
Director Bagley said that staff has spent a great deal of time in looking at
the fare structure and level. He believes it is time for the public to provide
their feedback. He recognized that there is the opportunity for modification
but he does not understand what staff and the Board will learn if this does
not go out for public comment.
Director James concurred with Director Bagely’s comments. He said that
through his meeting with staff it was clear that they have really explored a
wide array of possibilities. He pointed out that it has been a long time since
fares have been restructured. Director James expressed his appreciation to
staff and the efforts they have made to reach out to the philanthropic
community; he supports working with them as much as possible to help
those that are underserved. He believes the fare recommendations are ready
to be taken out for public comment.

Director Francone stated that at this time she is not ready for the
recommendation to go out for public comment.

Director Hoy commented that today students, seniors and disabled riders
receive half price fares but not have price Day Passes. He asked if that
would change with this plan. Bruce Abel stated that they would receive half
price Day Passes under the new fares.
Director Hoy said that this recommendation must be taken to the public. He
thinks that staff and the Board need feedback in order to make any changes.
Chair Sisk stated that he is all in favor of allowing the public to respond to
the plan so that staff can make additional recommendations accordingly. He
believes that it is important to encourage people that are less fortunate to
ride, which will be addressed once the foundation of the fare is in place.
Director Folska pointed out that in LA they just raised fare about 40% as
compared to staff’s recommendation of about 12%.
Committee Chair Anderson said that in the interest of transparency it is
incumbent upon this Board that the recommendations are taken out for
public comment. After we get feedback staff can begin to work with the
agencies that help the low income and transit dependent. She stated that
she thinks the Day Pass is a great idea. She noted that realistically if you
ride the bus somewhere you need to get back home so the likelihood of this
penalizing riders is non-existent. She shared that at a recent public meeting
she was speaking with a member of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee (CAC) who is very active in the community. This CAC member
can hardly afford paying a fare for riding the bus to each of her activities so
this will really help her.
Committee Chair Anderson informed the Board that she served on the
Arvada City Council for 24 years. She said on the council they had to make
tough budget decisions. She thought she was ready to make those
decisions when she was elected to the RTD Board of Directors in 2011;
however, hearing from a constituent about how cutting service will really
affect their everyday life is painful. She stated that no one wanted to cut
service like that again.

Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 10, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tobiassen gave his support for staff taking the recommendations
out for comment. He shared with the Board that his brother-in-law, who
uses a mobility device, would love to be able to pay a fare and catch a bus
to work but his community has cut funding to the transit system to nothing.
He said he is appreciative of the taxpayers that are willing to invest heavily
for an equal system. He thinks that cutting fares would be a disaster so it is
important to remain fare neutral as much as possible.

• Service Performance 2013

Director Menten expressed how hard it is for her to look at the Call-n-Ride
subsidies. She believes the service performs horribly on a subsidy per
boarding basis. Director Menten asked staff to work with her on an analysis
of the cost comparison between an underperforming fixed route that is
eliminated compared to adding a Call-n-Ride to help the riders who might be
affected. She wonders if perhaps RTD would be better keeping the fixed
route when subsidy per boarding is considered. Director Francone asked to
be included in the process.

• CCDC Agreement Securement Area Issues Report
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that per the terms of the settlement
agreement with Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC), staff is required
to provide the Board a report twice per year on challenges, issues, etc.
Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, said that in
general the bus operators are becoming familiar with the wheelchair
securement area policy. She stated that the drivers are doing what they can
to make sure people with mobility aids get access to our buses. She noted
that there are still issues with two passengers in wheelchairs already
occupying the securement areas but in those cases the drivers are very good
about calling dispatch to report the incident.
Committee Chair Anderson noticed that Route 52 seems to have that issue.
She thinks it is because that route serves Denver Health.
Director Tobiassen wondered if there was any feedback from CCDC as to
their perceptions. Carolyn Conover said that overall the feedback has been
positive. CCDC did ask if RTD was tracking any issues related to the area
where we are removing seats from a certain area to create space for people
with large items. She explained that currently there is not mechanism in
place for tracking this.
Director Menten shared that recently she heard from a constituent who is
blind and has a service dog. He told her about concerns he had on multiple
routes where other passengers were bringing dogs onto the bus that were
not service dogs despite the passengers claiming they were. This
constituent was having an issue with these dogs harassing his service dog.
Director Menten recognized that while drivers cannot question or challenge
someone claiming their dog is a service dog, she wondered if there were any
suggestions she can give the constituent in dealing with this issue.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, agreed that there is not anything that allows
RTD to question passengers about their disability; however, she said that in
terms of an animal that causes a disruption RTD might have some leeway.
She stated she would look into this and get back to Director Menten. Mike
Gil, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that
operators are trained to address a passenger with a disruptive animal that
the behavior needs to stop. If the animal continues to cause a disruption
then the driver is instructed to call dispatch so a supervisor can come to the
bus.

6.F

Director Hoy noted that he had to sign a couple of checks for Allied Barton
Security Services, LLC., which were very complicated. He said that staff
and auditors are doing a great job.

Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer, introduced Sheri Le, Manager
for Cybersecurity and Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for Information
Technology (IT). Sheri Le reviewed the Cybersecurity presentation included
in the February 10, 2015 Financial Administration & Audit Committee
Agenda packet. The presentation included the top 6 areas Directors need to
pay attention to regarding Cybersecurity:
 Cybersecurity Framework
 Cybersecurity Risks
 Employee Cybersecurity Awareness
 Cybersecurity Threat Analysis
 Security Governance
 Incident Response
The presentation also included Future Focus, Hot Topics, and Key Take
Aways.
Director Bagley said he assumes there are conferences and discussions with
other transit agencies about Cybersecurity and best practices. He
wondered, given the recent Cybersecurity issues with health care facilities, if
there are any threats specific to transit agencies defined in the past couple
of years. Sheri Le said that so far there is not anything specific to transit.
However, transit needs to be aware of other types of threats, such as data
breaches like the one in New York, which compromised personnel
information in early 2014.
Director Folska mentioned that it was comforting to know that Sheri Le is in
charge of Cybersecurity and that there is a plan looking forward. She added
that the Directors were recently given a presentation of the “Internet of
Things”(IoT). She also saw a 60 Minutes episode related to the IoT about
the Department of Defense (DOD) and DARPA’s hacking into cars to prove
automakers are not securing them. Director Folska wondered if RTD is
vulnerable to those kinds of attacks. Sheri Le replied that those types of
attacks require a very sophisticated attacker. RTD would be fooling itself by
believing that no one would attack as anything is possible. Sheri Le noted
that there are multiple, simpler layers to address before avoiding an attack of
that magnitude. She said that her original research when she first started at
RTD involved investigating highly sensitive threats, such as if an outside
program could move a train. Her conclusion was that it could happen but it
is not easy. She pointed out that her job is to add as many layers and doors
as possible in order to stop an attacker as early as possible.

• Cybersecurity Update (MacLeod/Heldman)

Director Hoy recalled the breach of Point of Sales (POS) machines last fall at
a couple of light rail stations where customer credit card information was
compromised. He pointed out that RTD could be a target for many reasons,
including the security of the Front Range and the operation of the City and
County of Denver and other Metro area cities. Director Hoy wondered if
there have been any outside breaches at RTD. Sheri Le replied that there
have been breaches but nothing has precipitated to a safety issue that might
harm individuals. Director Hoy pointed out that a lesson to learn from those
attacks is to change shields. Sheri Le added that once an attack happens
RTD needs to engage in incident response: stop the attack, notify the
appropriate parties and authorities, assess what needs to happen, and
assess the damage. She said that the next step after mitigating the attack
would be to figure out how to prevent such attacks from happening. The
final step would be to do a forensic assessment on how they got into the
system. She pointed out that as a defender the goal is to make access
difficult so the attacker can be stopped as they approach before they get to
what is really valuable.
Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that Cybersecurity is what he has been
doing with the DOD for the past 20 years. He pointed to the Snowden case
as a watershed moment for the DOD. He is glad to see Sheri Le on the
team as she brings serious expertise in this area. Committee Chair
Tobiassen would like to instill Cybersecurity as a priority for Senior
Management and the Directors in order to provide all the necessary
resources. He thanked Sheri Le and her team for their work and for starting
to develop a culture of security at all levels.

• Fourth Quarter 2014 Investment Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller and Acting Chief Financial Officer, introduced
Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt & Investments. They referred the
Directors to the Fourth Quarter Investment Report included in the February
10, 2015 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Agenda packet.
Committee Chair Tobiassen pointed out that it seems to be a good time to
borrow money. He added that the funds are not making a lot of money due
to low interest rates.

• December 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller and Acting Chief Financial Officer, presented the
unaudited December 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report as included in
the February 10, 2015 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Agenda
packet. He pointed out the variance on the 16th Street Mall Shuttle, which
is attributed to the Free Metro Ride, the variance on the West Line, and the
variance of Fare Revenue.

Director Bagley noted that the Fare Revenue has gone down significantly.
He speculated it could be due to the reduced cost of gas. He asked the
Directors to take this into consideration as the Board works to balance the
budget as well as the Fare Study recommendations. Director Bagley asked
Doug MacLeod when the CU-Boulder Leeds School of Business would
present to the Board next. Doug MacLeod noted that they are scheduled for
the March Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.

Chair Sisk indicated the discussion around the 16 St
Mall had less to do with the IGA but other concerns
expressed on paving improvements and costs. General
Manager Washington noted the staff is planning a
study session in March to discuss the general history of
the 16 St Mall and to help clarify the issues. Director
Folska shared that she is clear on the action item for
the IGA but has other concerns to be clarified. She
stated that while the $10M grant is to repave the 2 or
3 street block, her question has to do with the more
long term plans and if we should hold off with this
$10M investment until we better understood the long
term outcome. General Manager Washington
responded the money has to be spent on what the
grant was intended for. He expressed that some of the
issues raised in the discussion with Brad Buchanan was
premature as Brad’s vision has not yet been sold to the
Mayor and the City Council. It may be awhile before
any of this comes to fruition. Director Folska asked if
this will be wasted if we decide to rip out the transit
and replace with concrete. General Manager
Washington indicated he did not see the City getting
the $67M to do this and at best, there may be some
incremental changes. Director Bagley reminded the
committee that this is a collaborative effort between
the City, DDP, Historic Preservation and others. These
ideas have been vetted for over the past five years. No
decisions have yet been made. Director Walker added
that Brad would still need to get this past the Landmark
committee so this will be money well spent as the
pavers will still need to be replaced.
Chair Sisk noted that on the recommended action for
the May service change, Director Lubow had expressed
some comments. He added she may be providing more
comments at the Board session. Director Menten
added she is also looking at one of the proposed route
changes on the express bus at Federal Station but that

Vote on the
Motion:

The motion passed with all the Executive Committee in
favor.
Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.



Unanimous Consent
A. Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for
the BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro Rail Line
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
pass the attached Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to
the extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims arising out of RTD’s
ownership and use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL, including
but not limited to environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims
arising out of the use of automobiles, worker protection claims including those for
railroad worker’s arising under the Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the
Board intends that the limits shown in the Resolution shall be the limits to which
immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
B. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 64 - 40' Transit Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an
option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed
$27,500,000 for the purchase of 64 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare

she is working with staff to get more information.
Director Hoy noted that sometimes we get comments
from 1 or 2 people out of a constituency base of 2.8M
and we need to look at the greater good. Director
Menten stated she definitely understands this principle
as she is all about efficiency and fiscal responsibility
but wanted to give the issues raised proper
consideration.

Recommended Action

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD)
and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the
rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection
improvements within the CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16 th Street Mall
Reconstruction Project. The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and
the construction managed by RTD.
E. Board Report May 2015 Service Change
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors approve the May 2015 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes

Other Matters

Director Tobiassen inquired about the status of the video. General Manager
Washington responded they are preparing a white paper which he hopes will be
available to the Board this afternoon. Director Bagley indicated this was also one of his
questions. Director Menten inquired if the white paper would include looking at her
suggestion to get interns to operate the video as a way to hold down costs. General
Manager Washington indicated he was not sure.
Director Bagley commented about the upcoming Legislative Conference in Washington,
D.C. He expressed concern that the House would not be in session. He expressed
interest on five levels:
o What is the schedule?
o Who do the Board plan to see?
o What are the ASKS?
o If there are visits outside of the Colorado delegation, what would be the purpose
and the Board member should only share the approved RTD position and not pull
this out of the air.

Director Hoy added this should be a unified effort and this is key. All of our ASKS
should be in concert and coordinated with other entities who may be traveling to
Washington.
Director Menten asked for a specific example of problems we may have had in the
past. No one was prepared to give specifics. Director Hoy did share a positive
example where for the past couple of years, we have been unified in our ASK for the
full amount from the FFGA. In 2015, it appears we will get the full ASK including the
catchup from earlier. The ASK is the Message.
Chair Sisk commented that for the last couple of years, we have been unified in our
ASK. Although the House will not be in session, we have met with staffers in the past
and this has also been effective. He cited one staffer who is now running for City
Council. He also stated he thinks it could be beneficial to speak to other groups such
as someone from the Means and Ways Committee who are not part of the Colorado
delegation. We need to remember that financing goes before some of these
committees. We may need to be more broad based. The key is being consistent in
what we ask.
Director Folska agreed with Director Bagley’s comments and expressed they were
excellent. She indicated that she and Tina Francone as Chair/Vice-Chair of the
Government Relations Committee are working with staff to come up with a list of
people. This list will be sent to the Board members for their comments on who they
may want to visit.
General Manager Washington commented that we do need to be consistent and unified
in our ASKs. This message is Key. We have heard that from former Secretary Slater
and from current Secretary Foxx. We also need to remember we will be competing
with a lot of other people or delegations when we go to Washington. We seem to be
changing our philosophy and scheduling meetings late in the game. One year the Chair
provided input and now the government relations are providing input and we are talking
about a Board member sign up list. Patton Boggs is struggling right now to meet these
changes. They have anticipated from early fall what are the key projects and where
we might want to focus and have tried to schedule accordingly. We need consistency
in our process and message.
Director Bagley commented he found the PEST (political, economic, Sociocultural, and
technological) workshop useful and beneficial. He thanked Paula and her staff for
putting this together.

service vault puller area where she has humbly performed her function.
Mary Ann stated it has been loads of fun and she has enjoyed working with the
superintendent, and all the employees. Her job was wonderful.
Chair Sisk acknowledged Don Jones and the Jones family who were part of the early days
of the Denver Boulder Bus company. He also noted that there is a lot of institutional

Cesar Gebert spoke about the dynamics of people living in poverty. He stated 68%
of people living in poverty cannot use the transit system; 80% of women are in
poverty because they had to leave an abusive relationship; they do not have the
money to take bus and light rail back and forth. RTD needs to consider a pilot on
income based fares.
Kevin Kelly, Glendale, spoke about affordable income based bus passes. He shared
that He works with affordable housing and many of the residents miss job
opportunities because they cannot afford bus or LRT passes.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, advocate for affordable transportation, shared a
story she has heard from homeless families at the Gathering Place and Praxis. She
has heard about young homeless children who could not pay their fares and have
gotten tickets. She plans to bring some of these kids to the Board meeting next
month where we can hear from them directly.
Brian Moss, Westwood Highlands Neighborhood, spoke for the people struggling to
recreate their lives from tragedy or loss of hope. They have a peer program to
create a positive life experience so these residents can move forward. There is a
high reliance on public transit to get around town or to seek employment. This has
a great impact on the community and creates concerns about safety.
Julie Bennett from the Delores Project shared that she lives in a homeless shelter.
She is awaiting housing. However, once she is in her home, this will cause a
transportation issue as currently the shelter provides them with passes to get from
point to point. Once n her own space, she will have to figure out how to come up
with bus fare from her meager allowance. She knows of stories where people have
walked 7-20 miles to get to the Gathering Place.
David Rothenberg lives near Garrison Station. He reported graffiti along the line in
at least 18 different parts. He has reported this issue to the City of Lakewood and
RTD. He has taken pictures, talked to security and even call the RTD TIC line, all
without prevail. They were promised that graffiti would be removed within 24
hours. Some of this graffiti has been around for a year.
Debra Burns shared she lives in housing provided by the shelter. 33% of her
income is spent for housing. She cannot afford the transportation costs to get to
supervision, doctor visits, dentist, schools, etc. The Healthcare Act does not
include the cost of transportation.
Miriam Alvarez from the Westwood area is looking for more affordable
transportation rates. She stated that she has heard that RTD wants to increase
fares. This would not be good for her community where she lives. She has 4 kids,

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Rubin Brown Report on Cost of GM Contract - 2014
Chair Sisk indicated that per the audit recommendations, each year we perform an
independent audit of the General Manager’s contract and compensation impact on the
agency’s position. Tonight, Cheryl Wallace with the firm of Rubin Brown will present that
report.
Cheryl Wallace of Rubin Brown presented the cost analysis. She indicated the actuals for
2013 & 2014 were close to the estimates. The only difference was the discretionary
performance payout. She also noted that the General Manager has opted out on the
Medical Plan and we anticipate a savings of approximately $17K for the 2015 year.
Director Folska and Chair Sisk asked if this report could be made available electronically
and for future reporting. Acting CFO MacLeod noted that often this report is not ready

including but not limited to environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out
of the use of automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under
the Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the
Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
BACKGROUND
On November 7, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General Manager to enter into all
contracts necessary to implement design and construction of the NMRL. The corridor alignment
approved in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the NMRL includes right of way that RTD
needs to acquire from BNSF. BNSF has consistently maintained that it will not sell right of way for
passenger rail service if it will increase BNSF’s liability exposure. A requirement for RTD’s acquisition of
right of way from BNSF for the Gold Line and first electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Line was
that RTD agree to waive governmental immunity, purchase insurance and indemnify BNSF to the same
extent now required for the NMRL. The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits a
governmental entity’s liability for certain types of claims both as to dollar amount and matters for which
it could be liable. Waiver is permitted under state law so long as the waiver is by the governing body in
advance of claims and to a specified amount. RTD passed very similar resolutions for the prior BNSF
acquisitions. RTD also passed very similar resolutions for the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) for acquisition
of right of way for the NMRL and UP Property on the East, Gold and West Corridors.
DISCUSSION
RTD is acquiring property and entering into a Construction and Maintenance Agreement with BNSF for
approximately two and a half miles of right of way on the NMRL. RTD and BNSF trains will operate in
close proximity to one another. BNSF will not sell property for the use of passenger rail and thereby
increase its exposure to risk without indemnification. Federal law limits liability for passenger rail
accidents to $200 million per occurrence at the present time, and state law limits exposure to punitive
damages for both RTD and BNSF. RTD must acquire and maintain insurance in the amounts shown,

Packet Pg. 71

11.A

subject to review by the RTD and BNSF approximately every five years as a condition of RTD operations.
If RTD fails to obtain and maintain insurance and indemnify BNSF, RTD may be precluded from
operations in the shared portion of the corridor.
RTD will be required to maintain insurance and to indemnify BNSF for all claims for which BNSF is or
may be liable that would not have occurred but for RTD’s use of the corridor for passenger service,
regardless of fault. Responsibility for claims for which both parties may be liable are allocated after start
of RTD operations. Neither party may bring claims against the other. RTD will be required to obtain and
maintain Railroad Protective Liability insurance in the amount of at least $200,000,000 (two hundred
million dollars) or such greater amounts as may be allowed by federal statutes setting liability caps for
passenger rail accidents. Worker’s compensation, auto coverage, property damage and pollution liability
coverage are required. RTD must indemnify BNSF for claims its employees make if such claims are the
result of RTD’s use of the corridor. RTD is required to waive governmental immunity up to the limits of
coverage.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is already obligated to acquire coverage for both BNSF and UP in all shared passenger and freight
corridors under previous contracts and resolutions. Insurance is included in the Owner Controlled
Insurance Program for the NMRL. Operations phase coverage will cost only slightly more to RTD than if
this resolution were not passed, because coverage must be provided for portions of the West, and
virtually all of the East, Gold and Northwest Rail Corridors. Funding for the operations phase coverage
will be provided each year as part of the annual operating budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign
immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and
use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL, including but not limited to
environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of
automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the
Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the
Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
2.

Do not pass the attached Resolution. This will require an alternative alignment for the NMRL and
significant cost and time delays to the project. This is not recommended.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION No. ___, SERIES OF 2015
Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for the
BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro Rail Line
Whereas, On November 7, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General
Manager to enter into all contracts necessary to implement design and construction of the
North Metro Rail Corridor (NMRL) within the authorized project budget; and
Whereas, the alignment approved in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared
for the NMRL includes right of way that RTD needs to acquire from the BNSF Railway
Company; and
Whereas, the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits both RTD and
BNSF’s liability for punitive damages arising out of the use of the railroad right of way
shared with or acquired from a railroad for passenger rail services; and
Whereas, the CGIA limits RTD’s liability but allows a governmental entity to waive
immunity otherwise available up to an amount specified by the entity; and
Whereas, a condition of sale from the BNSF is that RTD acquire insurance,
indemnify BNSF and waive governmental immunity that would otherwise be available
under Colorado law for any incidents, accidents or losses occurring in the shared
BNSF/RTD portion of the NMRL alignment; and
Whereas, the BNSF requires RTD to obtain and maintain insurance for so long as
the BNSF operates in the shared corridor, to waive immunity and to indemnify it for any
claims and losses caused by use of the shared corridor for the construction or maintenance
of RTD improvements and the operation of passenger rail service and to apportion liability
in circumstances not covered by RTD indemnity obligations; and
Whereas, the CGIA allows RTD to waive limits under the CGIA and to indemnify
third parties for liabilities other than punitive or exemplary damages.
Now therefore be it resolved that:
The RTD Board of Directors agrees to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to the
extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying BNSF for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to
be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL including but not limited to environmental liability
claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of automobiles, worker
protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the Federal Employer’s
Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that such limits shall be the limits to which
immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.

Board Meeting Date: February 17, 2015

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 64 40' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053
with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $27,500,000 for the purchase of 64 additional 40’ transit
buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are now 15 years old and have accumulated on average 685,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The
bus manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts
required for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
calls for the replacement of the Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110
buses in 2014 and 64 buses in 2015.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary
price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 110
Gillig 40’ transit buses.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a guaranteed quantity of 64 additional 40’ transit buses to complete the replacement of the
2000 Series Orion buses.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 76

11.B

The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger
count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as walker, child stroller and
shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
guaranteed quantity of 64-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $27,500,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2015
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Gillig for the purchase of 64-40’
transit buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 18 60’ Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in
an amount not to exceed $12,300,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 18 additional
60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are now15 years old and have accumulated on average 430,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have
become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. Many of the parts
required for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
calls for the replacement of the 9100 Series buses over three years, 40 buses in 2013, 40 buses in
2014 and 18 buses in 2015.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 - 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement
was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17,
2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year
period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 40 New
Flyer articulated buses.

16th Street Mall Intersection Improvements,
Funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City and County of Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose
of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection
improvements within the CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16 th Street Mall Reconstruction
Project. The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by
RTD.
BACKGROUND
Under a separate IGA, RTD and CCD are jointly reconstructing up to 3 ½ blocks of the 16 th Street
Mall (“Reconstruction Project”). The Reconstruction Project is partially funded by an FTA “Bus & Bus
Facilities Livability Grant.” RTD and CCD are providing local match funds of 20%. Because of late
scope modification request by CCD, the initial scope of the Reconstruction Project did not include
intersections of the Mall and cross streets within the limits of the project. This Intersection
Improvements IGA is intended to fill that gap. The cross-street intersections are generally as old as
the Mall (more than 30 years); the concrete paving is deteriorating, and the existing traffic signal
systems do not meet current CCD design standards.
DISCUSSION
The Reconstruction Project scope includes reconstruction of the transitway pavers, their setting bed,
in-situ resurfacing of the walkway pavers, upgrading the Mall utility infrastructure (e.g. electrical and
irrigation), constructing walkway “bulbouts” at cross-street intersections for pedestrian safety,
replacing the existing pedestrian lights, and upgrading the existing urban furniture (e.g. benches,
planters, water features). However, repairs and upgrades to the full intersections were not included
as part of the FTA grant.
If the intersections are not repaired concurrently with the Reconstruction Project, the work will need
to be done at a later date by CCD, resulting in additional disruptions to Mall shuttle operations,
additional construction delays to vehicular traffic and pedestrians, and further disruption to
businesses adjacent to the Mall.
The IGA addresses funding of the intersection improvements, which will be reimbursed by CCD with
DURA TIF funds. The IGA also addresses the design and construction management for the project
and identifies RTD as the managing entity. RTD will lead the design and construction management
of this project with support from stakeholder agencies. CCD will reimburse RTD for all direct costs
associated with the construction of the intersection.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 80

12.D

CCD will reimburse RTD 100% for the construction of the intersection improvements as outlined in
the final IGA.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD)
and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights,
duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection improvements within the
CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project. The
intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by RTD.
2.
Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because delaying
the implementation of the IGA has serious impact to the schedule, budget, and RTD’s ability
to utilize approved grant funds, and would cause an extended delay of the Reconstruction
Project.
3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because this would cause
major delays in constructing the intersection improvements. The result would be additional
disruption to Mall shuttle operation and further construction delays to vehicular and pedestrian
traffic along the Mall.

Board Report May 2015 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and,
further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary
for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. The proposal regarding the
cancellation of the Route DD and reduction in frequency on the Light Rail W- Line are
ridership/performance based and in accord with RTD Service Standards. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between January 27th
and Februaryr 4th. Public meetings were held in Denver, Lakewood and Louisville with nearly 60 public
participants. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
May 2015 service change.

Light Rail
C-Line
It is proposed to adjust the clock headway pattern of the C-Line in the AM and PM peak periods
on Mondays through Fridays and have trips leaving 6 minutes later northbound and 9 minutes
earlier southbound. This will create a smoother headway of trains on the Southwest Line, where
there will be a train (C or D) every 6 or 9 minutes, more evenly spaced than today. This also
opens up the opportunity to increase headways on the E-Line, which currently shares open slots
with the C-Line. No operating hours savings or additions are anticipated with this change.
D-Line
It is proposed to start the 4:13 AM northbound trip from Mineral Station at Evans Station at 4:28
on Sundays and Holidays. This affects 6 passengers. Savings are estimated to be $5,370
annualized.
E-Line
It is proposed to add one peak round-trip train in the AM and PM peak (6:54 AM from Lincoln
Station, 7:44 AM from Union Station, 4:09 PM from Lincoln Station, and 4:58 PM from Union
Station) and to assist with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W-Line
transfers. This takes advantage of the altered C-Line schedule, creates a 15-minute frequency for
half an hour in each peak period, and is a test to determine the feasibility of adding more 15minute headway E-Line service in the future.
Cost impacts are estimated to be $235,875 annualized.
It is also proposed to discontinue the 4:33 AM northbound trip from Lincoln Station Mondays
through Fridays. An F-Line trips runs ahead of this train and a C-Line pullout to Union Station will
be adjusted to maintain the connection to Union Station and the W-Line. 20 passengers will be
affected by this change. Savings are estimated to be $70,750 annualized.
Additionally, it is proposed to adjust the clock headway pattern of the E-Line in the AM and PM
peak periods in the reverse peak directions (southbound in the AM, northbound in the PM) on
Mondays through Fridays, to coincide with the C-Line schedule adjustments. Trains will be
scheduled 15 minutes earlier/later than they are now. Two trips will be filled with additional ELine trains. No operating hours savings or additions are anticipated with this change.
H-Line
It is proposed to discontinue the 4:32 AM northbound trip from Nine Mile Station on Sundays and
Holidays. This affects 40 passengers. Savings are estimated to be $16,100 annualized.

W-Line
It is proposed to add a base train in the W-Line schedule to improve service reliability, increase
operator recovery time and allow for midday car cuts at Jefferson County Government CenterGolden Station. No impact to the public schedule besides adjustment in the early morning and
late night trips, plus an additional in-service pullout train in the early morning.

It is also proposed to discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods:
Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 7:01 AM, 7:31 AM, 8:01 AM, 3:31 PM, 4:46 PM,
5:16 PM, 5:46 PM, and 7:01 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:41 AM, 7:11 AM,
7:41 AM, 2:41 PM, 4:26 PM, 4:56 PM, 5:26 PM, and 6:11 PM. This service reduction would
result in the W-Line having a peak period frequency similar to that of the D-Line (10-15 minutes),
but still more frequent than all other individual light rail lines currently operating in the RTD
system. This proposed change effects approximately 789 passengers that will need to take a WLine 7.5 minutes earlier or later. Additionally, a third car will be added to the busiest W-Line peak
period trips.
The 10:18 PM westbound trip from Union Station on Sundays is proposed to be terminated at
Federal Center Station instead of Jefferson County Government Center-Golden Station. This
affects 5 passengers.
The 4:30 AM eastbound trip from Federal Center on Saturdays/Sundays/Holidays is proposed to
be discontinued and the 5:02 AM eastbound trip from Jefferson County Government CenterGolden on Saturdays and Sundays is proposed to start at Federal Center Station at 5:11 AM.
This affects 53 passengers. Savings estimated to be $639,000 annualized
Union Station Hostlers
It is proposed to cancel the Saturday and Sunday Union Station hostlers and reduce the additional
Monday-Friday Union Station hostler work, in concert with the W-Line improvements. Savings are
estimated to be $693,750 annualized.
Light Rail School Trippers
The D-Line and H-Line school trippers, train 14 and 57, Mondays through Thursdays, will
be canceled for the summer as per traditional practice. This includes the northbound DLine trip at Mineral Station at 7:13 AM and the northbound H-Line trip at 7:12 AM.

Proposed Service Changes for May 2015 runboard

In addition there were 3 people who attended, including former Board Member Dave
Ruckman.
Curtis Rogers
As a regular user of Route 9 he feels that the passengers would benefit if we could detour
to the Knox Station, as well as Holden Place, so passengers could better access to the W
line.
The stop E-bound at 10th farside of Federal is very poorly designed for ADA passengers.
He would like to see the route 9 continue to 10th Ave via Mariposa to better serve the 10th
& Osage Station.
More routine maintenance checks should be made on all Light Rail Station elevators.
Wouldn’t it be better for the Route 21 to short turn at Federal /Evans instead of Evans
Station?
We need to have a CnR service for the Downtown Littleton Area. The South Jeffco CnR
drivers will not go past Littleton Station. Littleton has very little service available.
Dave Ruckman
Originally the W line was slated for 5 minute headway, moving from a 7 ½ minute
headway to a 15 is a pretty serious change.
Mr. Ruchman has a friend who is blind who tries to use main stream transportation. When
he schedules a CnR bus he has to call ahead 24 hours and feels that it would be helpful if
he could try to schedule the CnR to pick him up and home, take him to more than one
location, so he could get more than one thing done on the same day. Has RTD ever
considered letting passengers set up 2 or more locations on the same trip?
He feels that in light of the growing economy this would be a very favorable time to
expand bus service. That Service Development should begin brain storming sessions,
looking at what other properties are doing around the country and possible implementing
new ideas for RTD to use to improve service.

Regarding Proposed Route 4:
 Commenter thanked RTD for meeting in the neighborhood and was an original rider
of the old Route 4. As a college student, she has had to walk 9 blocks with a
heavy backpack, occasionally missing her bus due to bad weather. She would love
to see the 4 return and offered assistance with a petition aimed at that goal.
 Commenter works with 9-to-5 Colorado and spoke regarding the difficult
transportation connections for community members between jobs and other
activities. She believes the 4 will open doors and hopes for better access cost-wise
for riders. She thanked RTD for coming to Westwood.
 Commenter is a new resident in Westwood and depends heavily upon access to
light rail service. Route 4’s proposed access to Alameda Station will allow better
access to resources and jobs throughout the metro region. He believed the bus
would provide increased safety to riders versus walking along Morrison Road.
 Commenter thanked RTD for coming to and being concerned about Westwood.
She usually rides Route 11, previously with small children and a stroller in tow.
She thanked RTD for considering reinstating Route 4 and appreciated the increased
safety the route would provide. She expressed concern that the service span might
be challenging for riders who work shifts ending after 8 P.M.
 Commenter is a transit coordinator with 9-to-5 Colorado.
She expressed
excitement about the conversations surrounding Route 4 and a possible circulator.
She looks forward to the return of Route 4 in May.
 Commenter expressed thanks for RTD’s efforts toward helping the redevelopment
of the Westwood community. She was grateful that the meeting was held in the
neighborhood instead of in downtown Denver. She was concerned about the
limited service span, but felt the route would help avoid dangerous incidents along
Morrison Road.
 Commenter represents West Unidos. She spoke regarding how a lack of bus
service in Westwood previously limited access to work. She expressed pleasure in
the increased service on Route 4 and the improved access to businesses and
additional grocery shopping options along Sheridan Boulevard.
 Commenter thanked RTD for being in the neighborhood and for bringing back Route
4 to the community. She is happy to see the route return and believes it will help
bring renewal to the neighborhood.
 Commenter thanked RTD for holding the meeting and believes that reinstating
Route 4 will help residents who have children better access locations on the east

analysis of Route 38 would be carried out for the May 2015 runboard.
Regarding Route 6 and Local Fares:
 Commenter travels frequently between 17th/Blake and 10th/Grant in Denver. She
expressed concern regarding the disparity between the fare paid for this short trip
and an equal fare for a trip of considerably greater length. She recommended the
use of a downtown circulator within a two-mile radius or between Union Station
and 30th/Downing Station. She questioned the source of RTD’s service component,
wondering if paying more for less represented good customer service. She also
requested information regarding how to identify her neighborhood’s director.
Regarding Facilities for the Hearing Impaired at Union Station:
 (Commenter is hearing-impaired and communicated via an ASL interpreter.)
Commenter expressed concern about the lack of a TTY telephone at Union Station.

Nate explained the format for the evening’s meeting and opened the floor to comments
pertaining to the proposed service changes. Since no attendees wished to discuss any
routes other than Route DD, the meeting transitioned to the public input session. The
following comments were received:
Regarding the Proposed Discontinuation of Route DD:
 Commenter indicated he has ridden the DD for years and views it as a beneficial
service for himself and others. Speaking on behalf of a 71-year-old disabled rider
unable to attend the meeting, the commenter described the burden placed upon this
rider were the DD to be discontinued. He suggested RTD consider a single daily
trip in each direction.
 Commenter has ridden the DD for 3 or 4 years. Prior to using the DD, he faced a
challenging commute on US 36. RTD alternatives to the DD would require starting
his day too early and ending it too late. He believes discontinuing the DD would
increase congestion on US 36 and agreed with the previous suggestion of a single
trip in each direction each day. The commenter works for a state agency and
believes wider use of the EcoPass would help increase ridership.
 Commenter wished to echo previous speaker and reminded RTD that the attendees
pay RTD taxes. First, he explained, the DD service was cut in half. Now it
consistently arrives late. Because many from Westminster board the DD, cutting
the service would inconvenience even more people. The commenter, an employee
at the Department of Health, drives to work 2-3 times per week and much prefers
the days when he commutes by bus and allows someone else to do the driving.
Removing the DD would be bad and the Way2Go solution would simply be an
additional inconvenience.
 Commenter works with CDOT off of Colorado Boulevard and believes the DD is a
great way to do perimeter routing. This helps relieve congestion focused in
downtown Denver. He observes congestion on other routes, stating that his wife
stands in line for 15-20 minutes to board the 120X. He recommends adding more
perimeter routing to reduce congestion, transfers, and walking.
 Commenter stated he attended a meeting regarding the DD over 3 years ago and
that a company did a study telling RTD to cut the DD to increase its cash reserves.
As a 19-year DD rider, he questions the decision to cut the DD when there are
more than enough people for one bus and the riders pay taxes to RTD. He stated
that he has tried alternatives to the bus, but wasn’t able to shorten his trip, even in
a personal vehicle. As a CDOT employee, he questions RTD’s desire to increase
congestion. CDOT provides EcoPasses, but people don’t use them. He questions
why the route would be canceled if people are willing to ride the bus

Commenter shared the story of a hearing-impaired passenger on the DD route who
is unable to drive. She expressed concerns about others who lack another means
of transportation and feared they might lose their jobs at one of the many
employers along Colorado Boulevard. Alternative transit options were mentioned,
but she expressed that Route 40 was not a good bus to ride. She does not want to
ride three buses instead of one and reminded RTD that many with disabilities would
be challenged by transfers.
Commenter asked if it was possible to view the analysis RTD completed to arrive at
the decision to discontinue the DD. Staff shared a brief explanation of the
subsidies per boarding for Route DD and indicated that the more detailed analysis
would be shared with interested attendees after the public comment period.
Commenter questioned whether a list of alternate routes was available for riders.
Staff offered suggestions for routings and their approximate travel times from
Boulder.
Commenter stated she liked the non-downtown routing of the DD.
Commenter stated that light rail was not a convenient alternative. He questioned
whether a compromise such as a smaller bus was possible. Staff briefly explained
the minimal difference in operating costs between smaller and larger coaches.
Commenter questioned if a single trip compromise was possible or if the route
could be continued further south on Colorado Boulevard to increase ridership. He
mentioned the route used to serve the Denver Tech Center.
Commenter questioned if the L could be extended to Colorado Boulevard.
Commenter questioned if Westminster to Colorado Boulevard could be an
alternative to running the DD all the way to Boulder. He said that driving to
Westminster or Church Ranch would be an option for many customers.
Commenter questioned why RTD would shut down the DD and increase congestion
on a roadway which was just improved.
Commenter suggested that RTD officials ride the DD to see where people actually
get on and off. Staff explained how, in addition to employee observations of
routes, automatic passenger counters provide RTD with boarding/alighting data.

Following an unanswered call for additional comments, the meeting was concluded at
approximately 6:35 P.M. Staff remained for approximately 30 minutes to answer
additional questions from attendees and share the cost and ridership analysis performed
for Route DD.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In the pursuit of the provision of mass transit service in the Denver Metro Area, equity is a core principle of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD). An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Environmental Justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically Title VI states, “No person in the United States
shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established
major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative
impact on minority or low-income populations.

SERVICE CHANGE PHILOSOPHY
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable
transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service
have different expectations of performance. We continually adjust services in response to changes in ridership
and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services
that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted.
We utilize our official Service Standards to establish performance metrics by which we identify
underperforming services on a class of service basis.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently, economically,
and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost alternatives in
discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the farebox recovery ratio of
the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for mass transportation can be
made available for other surface transportation needs.
Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7. Farebox Recovery Ratios – Plans

ANALYSIS
The FTA also requires that RTD establish policies that will guide the analysis of the Accordingly, RTD has
established equity analysis policies to meet this requirement and establish a service evaluation process.

Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate
Impact policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service which includes
but is not limited to: elimination of a route, shortlining a route, rerouting an existing route and
an increase in headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects, and analyze those
effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Equity Analysis

Packet Pg. 110

12.E.d

If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be
identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the
FTA will allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Major Service Changes
Pursuant to the intent to provide cost effective demand responsive services, RTD has proposed many service
changes to take effect in May of 2015. Per the Major Service Change Policy, the proposed major service
changes subject to this analysis are listed below.
Route 4 – New Route
It is proposed to reinstitute service on Morrison Road between Alameda Ave and Sheridan Blvd. Service will
run between Alameda Station and Sheridan/Evans via Alameda Ave, Morrison Rd, and Sheridan Blvd (please
see map, Attachment B). Peak frequency is proposed at 30 minutes, with midday and early evening service
offered every 60 minutes. Peak service will be offered from 5 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Evening service will extend to 8:00p.m.
Costs are estimated to be an annualized $258,300 and 2 peak vehicles
Route DD – Cancellation
Discontinue due to low ridership; average ridership per trip: 22 passengers; max load average: 15
passengers per trip; over half of the boardings (54+%) occur within Boulder along Broadway and along US
36, not along Colorado Boulevard; alternate route connections: BV/BF/BMX/BX, 86X to Union Station then
transfer to Light Rail to Colorado Station, or HX to Civic Center Station with transfer to Light Rail at 19th
Street and Stout Street, or Route HX to Civic Center Station with transfer to Routes 79L/83L.
Savings: Estimated to be $93,780 annualized

Equity Analysis Methodology
As previously mentioned, the basic framework for analyzing service changes for equity involves the
comparison of affected populations. The manner in which these populations are identified and compared is
described below:
1. Assess the proposed service change for adverse effects (e.g. frequency increase, shortlining, etc…)
2. Obtain applicable population or ridership data (e.g. customer satisfaction survey, census data, etc…)
3. Examine the proportions of adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income populations.
Ideally, we would examine ridership data, as the demographics of the area in proximity to services do not
always reflect the demographics of those whom actually utilize the service in question. Unfortunately, RTD’s
most recent survey data is not statistically valid at the route level. In lieu of statistically valid ridership data,
we’ve elected to utilize U.S. Census population data to assess the impacts absorbed by minority and lowincome populations. Below are a series of tables depicting the two services in questions, the nature of the
service changes and demographic data from the 2010 Census depicting the level of impact. We also utilized
Geographic Information System (GIS) maps to view this data geographically and included in Appendix A.

Equity Analysis

As mentioned previously, our primary objective within this analysis is to examine proposed major service
changes to ensure minority and low-income populations are not more adversely effected than the service area
as a whole. The Census demographic data shows the percentages of minority and low-income populations in
proximity to the Route DD do not exceed the thresholds of the aforementioned policies. The data also
illustrates the reinstatement of the Route 4 as an effective service increase, benefiting a geographic area with
above average concentrations of minority and low-income populations. Therefore, no disparate impact and
disproportionate burden was identified and the proposed major service changes do not require revision.
