## IV. Retiree Awards

There were no retiree awards.

## V. Public Participation

- Audrey DeBarros, 36 Commuting Solutions which is the TMO for the US 36 Corridor, commented on the draft fare structural proposal.  They appreciated that RTD listened to the concerns on US 36.  They like the simplified fare structure and the all day pass.  They also liked the use of the local fare along the Route BV.  However, they are concerned about the need to coordinate the BRT planning efforts of the US 36 with the fare structure study and would like to make sure this is a coordinated effort including the pricing for US 36 BRT.  They are also concerned about the one fare ride along LRT and where the replacement revenue will be made up over the long term.  They believe one of the effects is to lower fares to passengers who are already paying the least.

- Erin Bennett, State Director for the 9-5 group from Denver, spoke on behalf of affordable transit.  She stated they were quite surprised and disappointed in their initial review of the proposed structure; the increase to $5.20 per day from the present is not a cost that can readily be absorbed by the low income transit dependents.  They need a robust mass transit system.  She appealed to the RTD Board to make transit affordable to all.  Transit needs to be reasonable for all, not only for those who can afford.

- Margaret Johnson, Federal Heights, shared that she travels without exception on RTD.  She is truly a transit dependent.  She cannot afford $5.00 on anything.  She shared a story of some of her recent travels where she had to catch multiple buses and also walk some portion of the trip.  She relayed much of this was caused by being passed up by RTD buses or misdirected in schedules through information from our TIC.  She also stated the bus drivers were impolite and damaging passengers with abrupt stops, etc.

- Kara Choquette, Denver, lives near the light rail at University Station and is a frequent rider.  Her concern is with the lack of sufficient parking spaces there. RTD committed public spaces to the housing development along the light rail which had the inadvertent impact on riders trying to park there.  She believes there are a number of options available to remedy this situation:  She has noted there are at least 15 unused parking spots on the developer’s premise.   We could remove the reserved sign commensurate with use of the spaces on the developer’s premise. We need to also check the price the developer is paying for these parking spaces. They are currently paying $24 which is not compatible with the going rate for such spaces (approximately $40). We have given a good deal to the developer on premium parking spaces while subrogating the parking needs of our riders.

- Garry Miller, Denver, also spoke on the parking needs at University Station. He stated the situation is grave and needs to be addressed.  He has noticed that in addition to the issue raised by the previous speaker, DU students are also parking in this garage.  They are not part of the commuting public.  RTD needs to re-consider the parking attendant or establish security in the parking structure.  If they are looking for citizen volunteers to work on a solution, he is receptive.

- Tom Trujillo, West Denver, stated that his car is currently broken and he will need to make a decision between fixing it or riding mass transit.  His preference is to ride mass transit but the proposed fare structure is scaring him. Getting rid of the transfers takes away flexibility.  He believes RTD should be looking for ways to increase ridership rather than hiking the price which will drive people away.

- Hanni Raley, The Arc of Aurora, spoke on behalf of the intellectually and developmentally disabled community.  She stated they have participated in the RTD fare study for about 2 years.  She noted there is an unintended consequence of the fare study-the impact on the paratransit population.  Paratransit riders use about 58% of their personal allotment. With paratransit costs being about twice the amount of fixed route, an increase in fixed route will also increase paratransit costs.  This will reduce the amount of resources available to the disabled community for access to other services such as behavior services.  There is also a challenge with access-a-ride accepting 10 pass coupons.

- Dace West, Mile Hi Connects, represents over 120 different businesses and non-profit organizations.  She is concerned where does low income fit into the proposed fare structure. They would like to see the specific plans and timelines to address affordability before approval of this fare structure.  She also noted that the RTD process for the fare study has moved up two months ahead of the initial schedule that was laid out in the fare study plan.

- Violet Deseguin from Denver works with Prax(us), a homeless group that does outreach in places where the vulnerable population lives.  Quite simply, the homeless cannot afford a bus pass.  He and his associates have been in violation of our fare policy many times as they hop LRT to get to the homeless.  He understands that what he does is wrong but he is committed to outreaching to the homeless and he has a job to do.  They are looking for some affordable options.  Upping fares are obscene. They pay taxes and to hear they cannot get transfers does not help their cause. He is looking for help for the transit dependents and our homeless population who lives in a cycle of desperation already.

### A. Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for the BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro Rail Line

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL, including but not  limited to environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.

### B. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 64 - 40' Transit Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $27,500,000 for the purchase of 64 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare components.

### C. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 18 - 60’ Articulated Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in an amount not to exceed $12,300,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 18 additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.

### D. 16th Street Mall Intersection Improvements, Funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the City and County of Denver

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection improvements within the CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project. The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by RTD. CCD will pay any and all invoices submitted to RTD by the contractor directly associated with the intersection improvements on or before the due date of said invoices.

Primary Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to approve the 16 Street Mall Intersection improvements, funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the City and County of Denver.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Amendment to

Motion:              Director Lasater expressed he had spent time researching this issue and proposed the following amendment:  “CCD will pay any and all invoices submitted to RTD by the contractor directly associated with the intersection improvements on or before the due date of said invoices.”

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy requested a restatement of the amendment.

Director Walker stated that RTD will receive monies from Denver to do the work; in that case the invoice would come to RTD, not Denver.

General Manager Washington requested Henry Stopplecamp, engineering manager, to provide clarity on this issue.  Henry stated the bid opened on continued price for RTD to do the work.  The contract will bill RTD for RTD and City. As soon as RTD receives the bill we will invoice the city and the reimbursement will occur as soon as possible.  To hold this process up will create payment delays for the contractors and subcontractors and could result in an increase in cost to the contract to account for this delay in payment. RTD should have funds to pay for the invoice so as not to delay the process.

Director Walker reiterated this could slow down the payment process for our contractors and he will not support the amendment.

Director Folska stated the intent is not to hold up payment for the contractors; RTD should not be financing the work.

Director James stated he agrees with Director Walker.  This appears to be creating barriers to the process.

General Manager Washington reiterated this will impact on the small subcontractors and contractors.  This will also impact the IGA.

Henry Stopplecamp provided further explanation. He noted the contractor’s billing cycle would be extended out to approximately 60 days versus the 30 days.  This will increase fees to cover the cost of the funds.  This could raise the overall cost of the project.

Vote on

Amendment

to Motion:                The amendment passed with 8 in favor (Archuleta, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Solano) and 7 opposed ( Anderson, Bagley, Hoy, James, Sisk, Tobiassen, Walker).

Chair Sisk declared the amendment PASSED.

Vote on Primary

Motion with

Amendment:              Chair Sisk indicated the motion will be to vote on the primary motion for the 16th Street mall intersection improvements, funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the City and County of Denver with the amended language “CCD will pay any and all invoices submitted to RTD by the contractor directly associated with the intersection improvements on or before the due date of said invoices.”

Discussion:              Director Bagley inquired if this action could be rescinded or reconsidered.              Marla Lien, legal counsel, replied it could only be rescinded by someone on the prevailing side.

Director Lasater expressed outrage at the comments from Henry Stopplecamp related to the impact of changing the invoicing.  He stated in all his years in business, this is part of doing business.  When RTD receives the invoice, that same day they could simply forward copy to City of Denver who would need to pay by due date.  He cannot see where this will postpone the process.  These comments have nothing to do with contracts and are not applicable.

AGM Rick Clarke provided further explanation.  He understands the Board member’s attempt to get RTD paid as soon as possible.  However, in the normal process, it generally takes 1 week to review the invoice for accuracy, etc; then when we forward it to Denver and they will need time on their end for a similar review to validate the invoice.  This does build delay in the process.  It will complicate the signing of the IGA.  We have several IGA’s with various municipalities, etc.  The proposed process of reimbursement has never been a problem.  In fact, we are concerned this could complicate our overall relationship with the City               of Denver who is one of our greatest partners.

General Manager Washington added this revised process could act as a negative with our strategic partner, the City of Denver, as well as other partners across the region.  He is concerned about this amendment’s impact on our partnerships.

Call for the

Chair Sisk declared the discussion is over.

Vote on Original

Motion

with amendment:              The motion passed with 11 in favor(Archuleta, Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Lasater, Lubow, Menten, Sisk, Solano, and Tobiassen)  and 4 opposed (Anderson, Hoy, James, Walker)

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

### E. Board Report May 2015 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the May 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve the May 2015 Service Changes.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lubow expressed regrets on the cancellation of the DD route.  However, she noted this is not good use               of funds and so she will support the recommendation to cancel the route and will work with her constituency on other options such as vanpool.

Chair Sisk expressed similar sentiments from him and Director Hoy.

Vote on

Motion:              The motion passed with 15 in favor and 0 opposed.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED Unanimously.

## XIII. Executive Session

There was no executive session.

## XIV. Old Business

- Director Bagley wanted to know who was the woman in the audience who throughout the meeting was making comments.  Barbara McManus explained that per our policy, we must provide interpretive services for our meetings if requested within 48 hours.  The lady in the meeting was interpreting the meeting for our Spanish speaking riders.  Director Bagley requested if the Board could be advised of this for future meetings.

- Director Solano indicated that he had been asked why we do not provide bus services to the Red Rocks concerts. AGM Bruce Abel explained that these events do not meet the size requirements for us to provide service.

## XV. New Business

- Director Lasater shared some pieces of statistics/information that he had received comparing Southeast with Denver:

o        Downtown Denver employees 115,000 employees compared to 200,000 employees in the SE

o        The downtown business district consists of 35m sq. ft. of office space with 9 of the 40 top metro leases and 6 new buildings under contract; the SE consists of 45.8m sq. ft. of office space with 17 of the top 40 metro leases and  4 buildings under construction

o        Downtown Denver is the only municipality that does not pay last mile and gets free service

Director Bagley comments these statistics need to be put in perspective.  The SE does not have the same level of density or concentration of jobs as downtown Denver.

- Director Folska stated she understood that we will be discussing the 16 St Mall at our study session in March.  She looks forward to this information.  She inquired if this could include our stakeholders in this discussion. She is interested in some of the comments made by Brad Buchanan in our PEST workshop where he talks about the Copenhagen model.  We need to understand the effect on new mall shuttles and our investments along the mall both from the maintenance side and investment in mall shuttles.

- Director Solano added that he thinks it is premature for us to buy new mall shuttles before we understand the full impact.  We are putting the cart before the horse.

- Director James commented the process is good.  We have been addressing the mall shuttle for over 4 year now so it will be good to share the historical perspective and revisit this discussion.

- General Manager Washington commented that above all, our focus has been on the serviceability of the shuttles on the mall.  This is an ongoing financial drain.  The new mall shuttles have been on order because the current fleet needs to be replaced. They will invite stakeholders to this study session in March and provide the historical perspective as well as impact on ridership and funding.

- Director Menten commented she is looking forward to this study session in March.  She has been doing some research and trying to look at the big picture.  It certainly appears to be a huge drain.  She also commented about an article in the Denver Post about the snowstorm where she saw one of the RTD riders who is transit dependent get hit by a vehicle and fall over the roof.  She noted that in the image close by was the route 16 bus which could have easily ran over this rider.  She commented that our focus on safety is important.  She also noted that the study session in March on the 16 St Mall is a good candidate for videotaping.

- Director Folska reiterated her understanding that numbers or statistics can be misleading.  She thinks Bagley’s point was well taken in terms of density and concentration.  However, it is a fact that there has been much development along the SE corridor and quoted the Charles Schwab complex.

- Director James agreed that density and concentration along the central business district is higher than the SE corridor.  Ridership is highest on our 16 St Mall shuttle because of density.  There are consequences to changing the mall. The mall shuttle connects people getting off our buses and LRT at the Civic Center to their final destination around DUS.  He also stated that his understanding is the vast majority of mall shuttle riders are those whose trip originated elsewhere such as Southeast Denver.

- Chair Sisk commented this is a good discussion but expressed that we need to be focusing on what is best for RTD.  Our focus should be on the greater good and not necessarily trying to pit one side of this city with another.
