#### 1. RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and revise the structure accordingly.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, commented that he was filling in for the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chairs who were unable to make the meeting due to weather.  He explained that this recommendation was the result of extensive conversation with the Board and CAC Members.  He said the goal of the recommendation was to broaden the role of the CAC while maintaining the original intent.  The CAC will begin to focus on RTD’s Strategic Plan which will allow the CAC to always be aligned with what the Board has identified as RTD’s priorities.  He stated that the membership and selection process will remain the same.  The CAC has held off on filling its recent vacancies until this action was approved.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. North Metro O & M Update

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, said that while it might seem early to be discussing the operations and maintenance of the North Metro Line since it will not be opening until 2018, staff will be coming to the Board in March with a request for approval to enter into an agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) to maintain the 12 rail vehicles that have already been purchased for the North Metro Line. He explained that staff wanted to hear the Board’s input and questions so they could be sure to cover everything when they bring the request before the Board.

Henry Stopplecamp shared that the operations and maintenance of the North Metro Line had not yet been determined.  At this time there are three options staff is considering which are:

- RTD forms a commuter rail division under Rail Operations

- RTD issues a Request for Proposals for a third party to operate the North Metro Line

- RTD Enters into a contract with Denver Transit Partners to operate the North Metro Line in conjunction with operating the Eagle P3 lines

He reiterated that staff is still in the beginning phases of discussing the North Metro Line operations and maintenance and will come back to the Board to brief them once there are more definitive plans.

Henry Stopplecamp said he had Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, and Greg Straight, Eagle P3 Engineering Project Manager, with him to answer any questions.

Committee Chair Hoy summarized that RTD took advantage of purchasing these 12 trains in conjunction with trains for Eagle P3 to get bargain pricing, which means that while we got them at a bargain we now also have to do something with them until they are needed.

Director Bagley said that his understanding was the same as that of Committee Chair Hoy.  He noted that these trains will not just be sitting on siding track somewhere but will be incorporated into the Eagle P3 fleet until they are needed.

Director Lasater pointed out that this is very similar to what was done with the rail cars purchased for the Southeast Extension.  These 12 vehicles will be put in service even through the line they are for is not yet finished.

Director Lubow wondered if this took away from these vehicles useful life.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that any miles traveled by a vehicle will reduce its useful life; however, he explained that we needed to run the trains to ensure we discovered any issues before they were out of warranty.  Additionally, he noted that it is bad for a vehicle to sit for too long.  He said that they would be integrated into the fleet to keep the running and guarantee they had the proper service intervals.

Director Folska asked staff to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the three options outlined for the North Metro operations and maintenance when it is brought back to the Board.

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley wished Director Anderson a happy belated birthday.

Director Sisk thanked Committee Chair Hoy and Committee Vice-Chair James for cancelling the FasTracks Monitoring and Planning and Development Committee Meetings in January.  He thought it was a good sign of the Board working to eliminate unnecessary meetings.  He believes the Board will see somewhat of a convergence between the FasTracks Monitoring and the Planning and Development Committee Meetings as more FasTracks projects are completed.

Committee Chair Hoy thinks that convergence is really an appropriate term.  He stated that he and Director James will be very cognizant of only having meetings that are necessary.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 6:34 p.m.
