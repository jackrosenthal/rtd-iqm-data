1.4.1

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – June 2024

June 20, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, May 23, 2024. This report was prepared on
Tuesday, June 11, 2024, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee
meeting scheduled for Thursday, June 20, 2024.
Federal
The primary focus at the federal level has been on work related to the federal fiscal year 2025 (FFY25)
appropriations process. The House Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations
Subcommittee is scheduled to hold a markup on the FFY25 bill on Thursday, June 27, 2024, with the
full Appropriations Committee scheduled for Wednesday, July 10, 2024. No markups have been
scheduled in the Senate at this time. According to the current congressional calendar, there is little time

Packet Pg. 5

1.4.1

for the House and Senate to negotiate annual appropriations bills before the joint August recess. The
schedule then leaves less than three weeks, in September 2024, before the end of the FFY, following
which Congress will be in recess through the November 2024 election.
On matters related to congressional oversight, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is
holding two hearings. On Wednesday, June 12, 2024, the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and
Hazardous Materials will hold a hearing focused on Amtrak and intercity passenger rail. On Thursday,
June 13, 2024, the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit will hold a hearing titled “Revenue,
Ridership, and Post-Pandemic Lessons in Transit. Both hearings will be informative as Congress begins to
contemplate reauthorization of surface transportation policy in the final years of the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act.
State
RTD regularly participates in the Colorado General Assembly’s interim committee process, primarily
through the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC). At the time this report was prepared,
no schedule or activities for the TLRC had been announced.
Lastly, with the passage of Senate Bill 24-230 (SB230), which will impose fees on oil and gas
production to fund transit capital projects and operations, RTD has been tracking activities related to the
bill’s implementation. Specifically, the Clean Transit Enterprise is charged with developing a formula for
distributing grant funds associated with SB230. The next meeting of the Clean Transit Board of
Directors is scheduled for Thursday, June 27, 2024 from 2:30 to 4 p.m. Staff will report back to the
Board in the event that transit funding is discussed.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On Tuesday, May 28, 2024, Director Whitmore, RTD’s General Manager and CEO, and RTD’s
Government Relations Officer attended a study session with the Brighton City Council. Following the
study session, RTD staff has remained in contact with Brighton staff to collaborate on action items
stemming from that engagement. On Wednesday, June 5, 2024, RTD’s Government Relations Officer
joined staff from the Front Range Passenger Rail District for a discussion with the Parker Chamber of
Commer that included members from the Parker City Council. Lastly, on Thursday, June 13, 2024, staff
is scheduled to attend a regularly scheduled engagement with City of Aurora staff to discuss RTD
projects and priorities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed Bylaw Amendment Committee – Member
Vacancy Appointments

June 20, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On October 26, 2021, the Board approved Bylaw amendments that changed the composition of the
Board’s committees as well as how Directors became members of a given committee. The process
approved in October of 2021 currently governs how committee appointments are made. Currently, the
Executive Committee makes the committee appointments, typically at a Special Executive Committee
Meeting in early-to-mid January each year, and those appointments are then ratified by the full Board at
the regular Board meeting later that month.
While this system has worked well, it does not account for a vacancy arising on a committee following
the initial appointments. This year, Director Lewis was sworn into his Director office on February 27,
2024 to fill the seat vacated by former Director Williams on January 10, 2024. However, Director Lewis
was not able to serve on a standing committee his first month on the Board as there was neither a
vacancy nor a process to place him into a committee assignment before the Executive Committee met in
March. To accommodate Director Lewis coming onto the Board, Director Buzek stepped down from
what was then known as the Operations and Safety Committee at the conclusion of its March 13, 2024
meeting. The Executive Committee then appointed Director Lewis to the Committee on March 21, 2024,
and the full Board ratified the appointment at its March 26, 2024 meeting.
The proposed amendment to the Bylaws allows the Chair to make a committee appointment in the event
of a committee membership vacancy arising after the Executive Committee’s annual process to appoint
committee members, thus avoiding a situation whereby a new Director is not afforded the opportunity to
serve on a committee for some period of time following their appointment to the Board.
Additionally, the July 13, 2022 Operations and Safety Committee meeting was cancelled due to a lack
of quorum. This resulted in the need for a Special Board meeting to be calendared for July 26, 2022.
The proposed Bylaw amendment would also allow the Chair to make a temporary appointment to a
committee for purposes of ensuring a quorum. This ability could also be utilized to temporarily appoint a
committee member in the event of a prolonged temporary absence of a Director from their duties.

Packet Pg. 8

1.4.2

This item was originally scheduled to be heard at the May 2024 Executive Committee meeting but was
tabled to the June 2024 Executive Committee meeting.
INFORMATION
The Executive Committee is asked to discuss the following Bylaw amendment and offer any feedback.
Following the Committee’s discussion this item will be shared with the full board for input. The item is
then anticipated to return to the Executive Committee as a recommended action at the committee’s July
2024 meeting.
Proposed Bylaw Amendment to Article VI, Section 1(a), to add:
In the event a vacancy arises after the Board’s ratification, the Chair shall appoint a Director to fill
the vacancy, subject to ratification by the full Board. This appointment shall take effect upon
notification to the Board. To ensure a quorum, the Chair is authorized to temporarily appoint a
Director to a standing committee with such appointment effective upon notification to the Board
through the end of the committee meeting(s) for which the member was appointed.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Community Value as the Board must ensure the
community is appropriately represented and that meetings of the Board are not cancelled due to a lack of
quorum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to RTD for the Board to review and/or amend its Bylaws.

PREAMBLE
The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.
ARTICLE III – OFFICE
The Board may designate, locate and relocate its executive and business office and such other offices or divisions
as in its judgment are needed to conduct the business of the District. The office of the Board shall be located
within the RTD District.
ARTICLE IV – MEETINGS
Section 1.

the meeting outcomes into initial phases of the District’s budget planning cycle.
Section 5.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Board-to-Staff Communication and Requests for
Information and/or Records

June 20, 2024

REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Chair
Peggy Catlin, First-Vice Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board has a keen interest in ensuring a productive working relationship with staff, and a core
foundation of any working relationship is effective communication. To facilitate a healthy exchange
between Board members and staff, Directors are encouraged to reach out to the General Manager and
the Board Office with questions and requests for information and/or records.
Given the goal of ensuring a healthy working relationship founded on effective communication, the Board
has developed Operating Guidelines to inform its working relationships both between Directors and with
staff. Likewise, the Board Office has developed, in consultation with senior staff, the agency response
system to track Director inquiries and ensure those inquiries receive appropriate and timely follow-up.
The Board has acted on several occasions via resolution to provide additional guidance to Directors on
expectations for both their communication with staff as well as requests of staff for information and/or
records. These previous actions have set expectations for Directors to communicate respectfully with
staff as well as set limits on the amount of time staff should spend on a given Director request. Those
resolutions are attached to this discussion item.
DISCUSSION
In examining the approach to Board-to-staff communication and requests of staff for information and/or
records, it is important to view the matter through two primary lenses. The first, is the basic decorum
and values the Board expects Directors to uphold in their interpersonal interactions and communications
with agency staff. The second, is the collective volume of requests from Directors and the prioritization
of such requests, relative to the Board’s collective work and Director’s individual responsibility.
As Directors are elected officials, the capacity to hold them accountable for their behavior rests primarily
with both the voting public and the Board itself. As such, Directors are asked to provide initial feedback
and input on the ideals they wish to see reflected in the Board’s Operating Guidelines to further guide
expectations of Directors when interacting with staff. In August 2021, the Board adopted Agency
Values, which provide a useful starting point for discussion. These are:

Packet Pg. 31

1.4.3

-

Passion: We will be purposeful in delivering our work.
Respect: We will demonstrate respect and integrity in our interactions with both our colleagues
and community members.
Diversity: We will honor diversity in thought, people, and experience, being receptive to unique
ideas and viewpoints to achieve optimal results in problem-solving.
Trustworthiness: We will be forthright in our actions; we will do what we say, when we say we
will do it.
Collaboration: We will approach our work in a collaborative manner, seeking and acknowledging
valued input from our colleagues and the community.
Ownership: We will commit ourselves to continuous learning and do what it takes to deliver our
shared vision.

The Board’s Operating Guidelines encourage Directors to be curious and seek information to better
inform high-level governance decisions with which the Board as a body is tasked. Directors often have
interests and requests arising from their own curiosity or stemming from customers and constituents,
which require responses but often may not fall within the framework of the types of high-level
policy/governance decisions the Board is expected to make. As such, the agency response system is
maintained by the Board Office to help manage the process for getting Directors information on a range
of issues related to RTD.
A quick review of the database within which the agency response system is stored, indicates the
number of Director requests were up 65% in 2023 relative to 2022, and the number of requests made
so far in 2024 is on pace to be 96% greater than 2023. Since March 25, 2024, when the Board Office
commenced use of a new, more powerful database to manage these requests, it began tracking the
number of staff hours devoted to responding to Director inquiries. As of June 14, 2024, approximately
200 staff hours have been devoted to responding to Director requests since the new system was
launched.
In addition to agency responses tracked by the Board Office, staff works to respond to the Board via the
following avenues:
The GM/CEO, with support from staff, issues memoranda to the full Board
The General Counsel frequently advises Directors on a wide range of legal matters
The Information Governance and Management Division fulfills Director CORA requests (without
assessing the statutorily-authorized fee for staff time expended with research and retrieval of
records)
Staff prepare items for the Board’s discussion and potential action at Board meetings
Staff meet with Directors one-on-one to answer questions or concerns related to the agency
Given the above demands on staff workloads placed both by the Board collectively as well as Directors
individually, Directors are asked to discuss specific elements to include in a set of criteria in the Board
Operating Guidelines to help Directors consider the merits of any given inquiry or demand placed on staff

Packet Pg. 32

1.4.3

workloads. In 2024, the Board approved and began leveraging Committee Work Plans, which could
provide a useful starting point for discussion concerning response prioritization.
This discussion aligns with Community Value and Employe Ownership as the ability for the Board to
effectively seek information and productively interact with staff impacts the value RTD provides to the
community and the capacity for employees to take ownership of their work.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is not financial impact.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
New Director Onboarding and Continuing Education for
Directors

June 20, 2024

REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors believes in the education and development of Directors. This belief is
reflected in the Board’s Bylaws, Governance Manual, and Expense and Reimbursement Policy, which
each reference concepts related to continuous training, development, and education of Board members.
While these ideas are touched upon in the above documents, there is no single unifying Board policy on
training expectations for new or continuing Board members.
It is important for the Board to set clear expectations regarding the onboarding of new Directors as every
even-year election cycle seven or eight RTD Director seats are up for election, and Directors may only
serve two consecutive four-year terms. Given the realities of term limits and the election cycle, each
even-year election typically ushers in a slate of new Directors. These new Directors each come to RTD
with varying levels of background and expertise.
To help Directors become more familiar with the many facets of overseeing a diverse and complex
transit agency, the Board Office has historically managed a training program for new Directors. In 2023,
new Directors received updated training curriculum throughout the year on a myriad of topics essential
to helping Directors govern effectively including: Asset Management and State of Good Repair, Budget
and Finance, Capital Programs, Civil Rights (Title VI and ADA), Contracts and Procurement, Legal,
Operations (Bus and Rail), Planning, Service Development, Transit-Oriented Development, and Transit
Police.
The Board has an expectation that Directors continue their education and development as transit agency
board members and provides resources for members to do so. This includes inviting Directors to
trainings for new Board members and allocating funds to each Director to use to attend governance and
transit related educational conferences on an annual basis. Further, Article IV, Section 5 of the Board’s
Bylaws lays out an expectation for the Board to calendar study sessions “for the purpose of in-depth
study of subjects or additional relevant training for the Board.” However, the Board does not have a
process for identifying which subjects should be set forth in these trainings/study sessions.

Packet Pg. 37

1.4.4

DISCUSSION
The Executive Committee is asked to discuss the merits of developing a policy the Board would
subsequently pass related to new Director onboarding and continuing Director education. This policy
would include the following: timing of new Director onboarding, process and topics for onboarding and
director continuing education, and identifying who in the agency is responsible for managing Director
onboarding and continuing education.
The Board Office recommends that the Chair ask two Directors to partner with the Board Office
Executive Manager to craft and develop a policy related to new Director onboarding and continuing
education for all Directors. This policy would then return at least once for discussion and further input
before returning a final time for approval by the end of the year. The aim would be to have a policy in
place by the time new Directors join the board in January of 2025.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Community Value as Board member development can
lead to more effective representation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to RTD for the Board to develop a policy related to onboarding and
continuing education.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Two-Year Committee Appointments

June 20, 2024

REPRESENTATIVES
Erik Davidson
Jack Kroll
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the October 2023 Study Session, the Board discussed the idea of two-year committee appointments.
Director Davidson later followed up on this topic during the November 2023 Executive Committee
meeting. The Executive Committee subsequently added this discussion to its 2024 work plan, which it
approved in March.
Currently, committee appointments for the Executive, Finance and Planning, Operations, Safety and
Security, and Performance Committees are for one year and are governed by the Board’s Bylaws in
Article VI, Section 1. The Audit Committee, which in comprised of three Directors as well as up to two
external audit professionals, is set up for appointments to the body to last for two years. The Executive
Committee is comprised of members elected annually to the Board’s Officer positions (Chair, First-Vice
Chair, Second-Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer). The Executive Committee then meets each January
to appoint committee members to the Finance and Planning, Operations, Safety, and Security, and
Performance committees. Audit committee appointments are made on a regular cycle by way of a Board
vote and the Audit Committee Charter’s “Composition” section stipulates Board members serving on the
committee, “will have a two-year term, staggered with at least two Board members’ terms overlapping
an election year.” Additionally, the Audit Committee Charter requires Directors who wish to serve on the
committee to have served at least one year on the Board.
During the conversation last fall at the Study Session then Board Chair Guissinger and then Second-Vice
Chair Davidson broached the topic of two-year committee appointments and how the upcoming election
in 2024 provided a natural opportunity to transition to two-year committee appointments if the Board so
desired. Some of the potential benefits of moving to a two-year committee mentioned during that
discussion:
•
•
•
•

Greater opportunity for Directors to grow their expertise in an area of governance
Increased concentration of knowledge related to the Board’s duties and responsibilities
Improved continuity of committee’s work and work plans
Better consistency of relationships with key agency staff

Packet Pg. 39

1.4.5

Some of the drawbacks and concerns of such a system previously discussed by the Board include:
•
•
•

Increased likelihood of Directors must remain on a committee for which their interests or
expertise are not aligned
Potential for an election cycle to disproportionately impacting membership of a committee
Whether a change is necessary given that committee membership does not necessarily fluctuate
currently

Following the October 2023 Study Session, the Board Office subsequently surveyed APTA members
regarding the length of terms for board committee members at other agencies and received responses
from the following transit agencies: GoTriangle in North Carolina, Greater Cleveland Regional Transit
Authority, Jacksonville Transportation Authority, LA Metro, and San Mateo County Transit District. All
the responding agencies indicated that their committee appointments were for one year.
DISCUSSION
Directors are asked to consider the pros and cons of moving to a two-year committee appointment
process. Some of the items the Board should consider in having this discussion are below:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Potential pros and cons of moving to a two-year committee appointments
The process for appointing committee members for two-year terms
How to address vacancies arising on a committee during the two-year period
The ability for Directors to indicate interest in a committee
How the length of the appointment impacts the election of a Committee’s chair and vice chair
Whether the length of terms should be adjusted for the Board’s Officers who comprise the
Executive Committee
If two-year committee appointments were to be proposed for adoption by the Board what the
timing of such a change should be

Should the Board wish to pursue a system of two-year committee appointments, the Board’s Bylaws
would need to be amended accordingly. The Board Office recommends that such work be done in
consultation with up to two Directors whom the Chair asks to work with the Board Office to develop a
proposed amendment or set of amendments to the Bylaws.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising this discussion regarding two-year committee appointments.

Subject: Audit Committee Charter
Page 2

The Audit Committee will consist of at least three and no more than five members, all of whom, in the judgment of
the Board of Directors, shall be independent in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To qualify as
independent, an audit committee member may not be employed by, or provide any services to, the organization
beyond their duties as a committee member or Board Member. The members should collectively possess sufficient
knowledge of audit, finance, specific industry knowledge, IT, law, governance, risk, and control. Because the
responsibilities of the Audit Committee evolves in response to regulatory, economic, and reporting developments, it
is important to periodically re-evaluate members’ competencies and the overall balance of skills on the committee in
response to emerging needs. At least one member shall be designated as the "financial expert," as defined by
applicable legislation and regulation.
The Board of Directors shall have three members of the Audit Committee, each of whom shall have served on the
Board of Directors for at least one year. Should a Director cease to maintain a position on the Board of Directors,
such a Director can, with the approval of the Board of Directors, continue to serve on the Audit Committee for a
period of up to one year.
The members of the Audit Committee, by a majority vote, will designate a chair and vice chair, for a period of one
year
The term of office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term, staggered with at
least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of the Audit Committee will have
two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance of Audit Committee members will be
reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit Committee, the appointment of members should be
staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit Committee.
Each member of the Audit Committee shall serve for such term or terms as the Board may determine or until his or
her earlier resignation, removal or death. Any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board. No member of
the Audit Committee shall be removed as a member, except upon the affirmative vote of ten Directors.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee will meet at least four times a year, with authority to convene additional meetings, as
circumstances require. All committee members are expected to attend each meeting, in person or virtually, and are
obligated to prepare for and participate in meetings. The quorum for the Audit Committee will be a majority of its
members.
The Chief Audit Executive (as defined in the internal audit charter) and Chief Financial Officer are required to attend
all Audit Committee meetings. The Chief Audit Executive or designee will facilitate and coordinate meetings as well
as provide ancillary support to the committee, as time and resources permit.
Meeting agendas will be prepared in consultation with Audit Committee members, management, and its auditors, to
be provided in advance to members, along with appropriate briefing materials. Minutes will be prepared and all
documentation related to the Audit Committee and its dealings may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act,
C.R.S. § 24-72-201 et seq., as amended. The Audit Committee will provide updates to the Board of Directors at least
quarterly.
The Audit Committee will invite members of management or others to attend meetings and provide pertinent
information, as necessary.
Audit Committee members will receive formal orientation training on the purpose and mandate of the committee and
on the organization’s objectives. A process of continuing education will be established.

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created by the Regional Transportation District
Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly,
First Regular Session, 1969). The District is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, with those powers
specifically granted and those reasonably implied from the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the
objects and purposes of the District.
The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly conferred by the RTD Act, at § 329-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD
Act, while others are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the Board. For
convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.
ARTICLE III – OFFICE
The Board may designate, locate and relocate its executive and business office and such other offices or divisions
as in its judgment are needed to conduct the business of the District. The office of the Board shall be located
within the RTD District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Agency Performance Scorecard Recommended Revisions

June 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt revisions to the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Agency Performance Scorecard.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager/CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions in late 2022 and throughout 2023 to develop tactics to improve
agency performance in specific areas. These tactics were distilled into three overarching Strategic
Initiatives for 2023 and 2024:
Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles.
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development.

Packet Pg. 66

2.16.A

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve
community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.
For the performance period commencing September 1, 2023, and concluding July 1, 2024, each nonrepresented employee was required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed using the
SMART framework and based on the Strategic Initiatives.
These goals have been intentionally designed to drive and incentivize individual performance, which in
turn improves the performance of the agency overall. Moreover, the initiatives reflect a renewed
collective focus to deliver meaningful progress toward achieving the Success Outcomes.
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

Customer Excellence

How is RTD achieving its
vision to be the trusted
leader in mobility?

How is RTD meeting
customers’ needs?

How has RTD delivered
value to the communities
it serves?

Employee Ownership

Financial Success

How well is RTD
How has RTD
attracting highly skilled
demonstrated good
and engaged job seekers? stewardship of taxpayer
dollars?
How is RTD creating a
What is RTD doing to How has RTD developed
welcoming transit
inspire employees to build trust as the leader in
environment?
a career?
mobility?

In alignment with this effort, staff has developed a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard) that will provide answers to these questions and serve as an easily accessible
repository for performance data related to the Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also be
expanded over time to house information related to the agency budget and financial reports, people
power statistics, and other key measurements. The performance dashboard will enhance agency
transparency and assist the Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes.
The performance dashboard launched in late May 2024.
DISCUSSION
As noted in the Strategic Plan document, and as contemplated by the Board and staff in 2021,
performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting agency metrics,

Packet Pg. 67

2.16.A

and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success outcomes is an
essential element of the Strategic Plan.
Draft revisions to the scorecard were developed by staff in collaboration with the Board Chair and
Performance Committee Chair, leveraging both the above-referenced open-ended questions posed during
the Board’s 2024 retreat, as well as a detailed discussion with the Performance Committee at its
meeting on May 21, 2024.
Further, staff is developing a separate annual scorecard related to agency performance driven by an
operational vantage point. Related to this scorecard, staff will define success and develop action steps
that tie into staff work plans, which stem from strategic initiatives, and other key drivers related to
agency performance, predicated upon annual survey data. The annual scorecard will be presented to the
Performance Committee as a draft no later than the September 2024 Performance Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of the Agency Performance Scorecard
revisions.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) Ballot Initiative

June 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number __, Series of 2024 submitting a
ballot question to the eligible electors of RTD at an election to be held on November 5, 2024, without
imposing any new tax or increasing any tax rate, authorizing RTD to continue to collect, retain and
spend all revenues it receives from whatever sources without regard to the limitations set forth in the
Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
TABOR is a 1992 voter-approved amendment to the Colorado Constitution that generally limits the
amount of revenue Colorado governments can retain and spend. TABOR requires voter approval to
increase taxes or retain excess revenues above certain limits that TABOR sets, as well as to issue
certain new multi-year financial obligations such as bond debt.
TABOR allows governments to retain and spend an annual amount based on the prior year’s actual
revenue plus a growth factor. For RTD, the TABOR annual revenue growth limit is determined by the
sum of the change in the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus the net change in
new property construction. Revenues collected in a fiscal year that exceed these limits must be returned
to taxpayers.
Colorado governments can and have implemented voter-approved exemptions from TABOR’s revenue
and spending limitations, either for a fixed period of time or indefinitely. Exemption from TABOR’s
revenue and spending limits is referred to as being “de-Bruced” in reference to the author of the TABOR
constitutional amendment, Douglas Bruce.
In 1995, District voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through 2005.
In 1999, voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through the period
required to pay bond debt issued to finance the construction of certain light rail lines but not past 2026.
This voter-approved structure includes the 0.6% RTD sales and use tax, is referred to as the Base
System. The Base System bond debt will be fully repaid in November 2024, which will subject all of

Packet Pg. 99

2.16.B

RTD’s TABOR-applicable revenue, except the 0.4% sales and tax levied for RTD’s FasTracks Project
(discussed below), to TABOR’s growth limitations beginning in 2025.
In 2004, District voters authorized RTD to collect an additional 0.4% sales and use tax for the FasTracks
Project. Approval of this ballot measure also authorized RTD to issue a fixed amount of FasTracks bond
debt to finance the construction of the FasTracks transit expansion elements. The approved ballot
measure requires the “sunsetting” of the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use taxes, after the debt is repaid,
to the amount necessary to operate and maintain these FasTracks elements. The FasTracks debt will be
repaid by 2050. Further, the FasTracks voter authorization only applies to the 0.4% sales and use tax
resulting in all other TABOR-applicable FasTracks revenues being subject to TABOR limitations in 2025
in addition to the Base System revenues.
All of RTD’s TABOR applicable revenues, except the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax, will establish
the basis for calculating revenue limits for 2025.
2024 budget revenues are $1,352.1 million of which $668.5 million or 49.4% is subject to TABOR.
DISCUSSION
TABOR revenue growth limitations will limit the annual allowable growth in RTD’s revenue collections
beginning in 2025. Revenue collected in excess of these TABOR limits must be returned to taxpayers.
These revenue growth limitations will likely adversely impact RTD’s future availability of funding.
In order to maintain and continue the 1999 voter authorization, and without imposing any new tax or
increasing any tax rate, the resolution submits a ballot question to RTD eligible voters at the election to
be held on November 5, 2024, authorizing RTD to continue to collect, retain, and spend all revenues it
received from all sources without regard to TABOR limitations.
The resolution includes the Board of Directors formal endorsement and support for the ballot question at
an election to be held on November 5, 2024. It authorizes and directs the General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO) or General Counsel to take all actions necessary or appropriate to effectuate the resolution,
including authorization to enter into intergovernmental agreements with each county clerk, and appoints
the General Counsel as the designated election official.
RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow LLP in regard to the ballot question and election.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this recommended action is to mitigate the financial risk associated with adverse
impacts to RTD’s revenue from TABOR.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Central Park Station Development Negotiation

June 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to negotiate and
execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with Ulysses Development Group for the future lease
and development of the real property located at 3801 N Ulster Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired what is now Central Park Station on the A Line from Stapleton Development Corporation
in two phases. In August 2010, RTD acquired eight acres for $1,057,047. Two years later, in July
2012, RTD acquired an additional 11.6 acres for $1,585,082. The land was originally purchased for the
Central Park Bus Facility and Park-n-Ride (PnR) and was later incorporated into the Eagle P3 Project to
serve the A Line. RTD purchased the property using federal grant funds under grant CO-03-0125. As of
2024, the bus facility serves as the operating base for nine routes (28, 37, 38, 42, 43, 65, 73, 88, and
105), and the PnR contains 1,521 spaces. The PnR is part of RTD’s parking management system but is
not maintained by Denver Transit Operators (DTO) through the Concession Agreement.
The subject of this Recommended Action item is the PnR’s westernmost parcel, located at 3801 N
Ulster Street, on the southwest corner of Smith Road and Ulster Street (the Property). The six-acre
Property has 651 transit parking spaces with very low parking utilization and very high development
potential. In February 2023, Ulysses Development Group (UDG) submitted Step 1 of RTD’s Unsolicited
Proposal Process for Joint Development (UPP), commencing a discussion between the developer and
RTD Planning staff. The UPP stems from the 2010 Board-adopted TOD Strategic Plan, which created a
more focused policy that guides RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities
near transit. That plan was followed by the Board-approved Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property
in 2015, which guides the UPP that developers must follow to pursue development on RTD property. In
2021, the Board approved the Equitable TOD Policy, encouraging the development of affordable housing
on RTD land.
In June 2023, UDG submitted the second step of the UPP, the Technical Review, proposing to replace
the site’s 651 parking spaces with approximately 800 units of affordable housing and community
amenities. The RTD Technical Review Committee, composed of Operations, Capital Programs, Safety

Packet Pg. 106

2.16.C

and Environmental Compliance, Transit Police and Emergency Management, Finance, Legal Services, and
Planning department staff, noted that parking utilization at Central Park stands at less than 30%, and
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had hovered around only 50%. With this information, and with the
certainty that approximately 800 affordable units would generate more customers than 651 empty
parking spaces, the committee agreed that the parking space reduction was appropriate. Finding no fatal
technical flaws in the proposal, the committee approved the site for potential development, obtained
concurrence from each committee member’s department leader, and notified UDG of the committee’s
findings.
Planning staff then sought concurrence and approval from the General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer (GM/CEO) to terminate the UPP and immediately issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to
develop affordable housing on the site. Departing from the UPP and proactively issuing an RFQ served
two purposes: first, it leveled the playing field by reducing UDG’s head-start on the project; second, it
streamlined the pre-development timeline by reducing the somewhat redundant review that is
purposefully built into the UPP. The UPP is intended for sites that are less desirable because such sites
only pencil under certain conditions and with the right developers. UDG’s proposal review demonstrated
that the Central Park site is more viable than previously thought because of changes in parking
utilization.
The GM/CEO agreed to the new direction, and Planning Department staff worked with the Contracting
and Procurement Division to issue the RFQ in November 2023. After a 90-day solicitation period, the
selection committee conditionally chose UDG based on its ambitious affordable housing program, access
to financial resources, and development experience. To continue to the next step in the joint
development process, RTD must execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with UDG.
DISCUSSION
If the Board adopts this recommended action, the agency may operationalize the 2021 Equitable TransitOriented Development Policy and further the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by creating much-needed housing near transit, improving
transit access, and generating revenues for RTD.
The ENA will address, among other items:
•
•
•
•

Negotiation and design schedule
Project financing
Development plan (density, use, affordability)
RTD maintenance and operations requirements

The ENA will permit a 24-month negotiation period, commencing on the effective date of the ENA.
However, RTD may extend the term of the ENA at its sole discretion. Board authorization through a
future action will be required to lease the Property to UDG and begin construction.

Packet Pg. 107

2.16.C

As discussed during the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, ground lease
payments will be key to the ground lease negotiation. Statutory changes enacted following the 2024
legislative session removed the requirement that RTD receive fair market value when disposing of its
land, instead leaving full discretion to RTD to determine the ground lease or sale value. The Equitable
TOD Policy, adopted by the Board in April 2021, indicates that RTD can be flexible on price, but includes
no other guidance. As a path forward, staff will return to the Board with a recommended framework for
land value discussion based on existing policy and thorough research on the topic.
If RTD and UDG do not execute the ENA, are unable to negotiate a ground lease or any other necessary
agreements, or if the Board does not authorize disposition of the Property through a future action, RTD
will remain the property owner and any subsequent decisions regarding the Property would be subject to
Board approval. Staff will keep the Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the ENA will have no financial impact to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
“Group 33” Fixed-Route Service Contract

June 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Transdev Services Inc. for the provision of fixed-route services as described herein. This
contract is for three years, with two one-year options for a total of five years, at a total not-to-exceed
cost of $186,603,968. Additionally, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $16,101,761 over five years. The total five-year not-to-exceed cost for services and
fuel is $202,705,729.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5 (2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. This service contract is referred to
as “Group 33,” which replaces the Group 29 service contract.
The service package consists of 109 buses providing approximately 284,861 revenue hours per year.
The routes provide service to the cities of Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Commerce City, Englewood,
Glendale, Highlands Ranch, Lakewood, Littleton, Lone Tree, Parker, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat
Ridge, the City and County of Broomfield, and the City and County of Denver.
DISCUSSION
A Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace the Group 29 service package was issued February 5, 2024,
with proposals due March 18, 2024, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process.
The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and was advertised via transit-industry-related
publications. During the solicitation period, one proposal was received. A panel of staff subject matter
experts assessed the proposal using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall
evaluation of the proposal, the panel recommends awarding the contract to Transdev Services Inc. The
term for the Group 33 contract will be for three years, with two one-year options, for a total of five
years.

2025. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s financial forecast and will be
presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each year’s respective budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand - Additional Funding

June 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
June 25, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to designate
additional funding for the Access-on-Demand program in an amount not to exceed $8,600,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations

PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD and its contractor partners deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,342 square-mile service
area, including bus, light rail, commuter rail, and microtransit services, as well as Access-a-Ride
complementary paratransit services in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
In November 2020, RTD launched its Access-on-Demand paratransit service within the umbrella of
Access-a-Ride. Access-on-Demand began as a supplemental demand-response pilot program in
partnership with transit network company Uber. The program’s goal was to provide a responsive, ondemand platform for paratransit customers, which was similar in operation to the agency’s Access-a-Cab
program as it existed at that time. The Access-a-Cab program provided alternative paratransit service
through private transportation providers.
The Access-on-Demand pilot program provided customers a per-trip subsidy of up to $20, and eligible
customers were required to pay the first $2 in fare for each trip. Access-a-Ride customers within four
ZIP codes, selected for their density of existing paratransit customers, were eligible to participate. The
program hours were between 6 and 9 a.m. and between 2 and 5 p.m. The program was later expanded
to an additional three ZIP codes and was expanded again to serve customers 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. During the pilot period, RTD continued to offer its Access-a-Cab demand-response service, for
which a $12 subsidy was offered, and customers were required to pay $2 in fare for each trip.
Following the Board’s approval of funding in November 2022 in the amount of approximately $9.3
million, in January 2023, RTD merged the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Cab programs. Since then,
RTD has partnered with four contracted private providers, Uber, Lyft, Metro Taxi, and zTrip, to provide
Access-on-Demand service. Customers travel using their choice of these providers, receive a subsidy of

Packet Pg. 120

2.16.E

up to $25 per trip, and pay no upfront fare costs. Additionally, customers schedule trips through the
providers’ mobile apps or call centers, as applicable, rather than via RTD’s Access-a-Ride call center.
Customers are limited to 60 trips per month and are responsible for monitoring their trip usage.
Due to the popularity of Access-on-Demand as an alternative to traditional paratransit services, demand
for service quickly exceeded expectations following the expansion of the pilot program in January 2023.
For example, ridership increased during the 2023 Zero Fare for Better Air (ZFBA) period on both Accessa-Ride by 7% and Access-on-Demand by 25%. The significant increase in demand for Access-onDemand service is likely due to the same-day convenience when booking an Access-on-Demand trip and
the elimination of the subsidy cap. During the ZFBA period, paratransit customers continued to receive
up to 60 Access-on-Demand trips monthly and additionally were able to travel anywhere in RTD’s
service area for zero-fare, that is, no out-of-pocket costs as the subsidy cap of $25 per trip was
removed.
To ensure customers have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD recently
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery. This on-site review was
conducted by industry subject-matter experts in late May 2024. These individuals engaged in a holistic
review of the paratransit program, including both the Access-on-Demand program and the Access-a-Ride
program. Their recommendations will assist RTD in adopting industry best practices, understanding the
agency’s strengths and opportunities with respect to paratransit service delivery, and determining
options for potential improvements, sustainability, and fiscal responsibility.
DISCUSSION
In considering this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Priorities of Customer
Excellence and Financial Success.
Based on projected continual growth in demand for Access-on-Demand, an additional $8,600,000 is
required in order to continue to provide Access-on-Demand services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the Access-on-Demand program, in an amount not-to-exceed $8,600,000, will be made
available through the unrestricted reserve. Future funding for this program will be allocated through the
annual budget process.
