Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for September 6, 2016
1. RTD Candidate Update – Ten candidates have had their petitions deemed sufficient by

the Secretary of State. One candidate, Billy Robinson, failed to resubmit by the 8/15
deadline and two candidates, Lee Kemp and David Casiano, seeking to address their
earlier insufficiency had their resubmitted petitions again deemed insufficient. Districts
D, F, G, and H are uncontested. The Metro Mayors Caucus, Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce, Transit Alliance and area transportation management organizations will be
taping interviews of the candidates on September 15 to be made available to municipal
Channel 8 stations and shared via YouTube for cities that don’t have a Channel The
Secretary of State’s Office will hold a lot drawing to determine ballot order on September
1st. I will share results of the drawing at the LGR meeting.
2. Mobility Choice – Mobility Choice, a partnership among the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce, Colorado Department of Transportation, Regional Transportation District,
and Denver Regional Council of Governments, is the non-profit overseeing the
preparation of the 2030 Blueprint. Funding for the effort has been secured and we
anticipate that a Request for Qualifications will be issued soon.
3. Metro Mayors Caucus - The MMC also has reconvened its transportation task force to
begin discussing options for a metro-area solution to transportation funding. The process
to legally create and fund a metro-area regional transportation authority or other special
district is complicated and there are many unknowns as to how any such entity would
work with RTD.

Re:

Update

BBMK attended the Legislative Audit Committee meeting on August 22nd. General Manager
Dave Genova provided an update to the committee on the audit recommendations from the Bus
and Light Rail Train Operatory Safety Audit performed in 2015. The consensus from the Audit
Committee members is that the Audit was successful and provided significant safety
improvement measures and that RTD’s commitment to incorporating the suggestions was very
well received. Several RTD executive staff joined Director Genova which further demonstrated
the District’s commitment to working with the Audit Committee.
In order to prepare for the 2017 legislative session BBMK has been meeting with current
legislators and candidates. As is our practice BBMK will meet with all newly elected legislators
prior to the January session begins to update them on the District’s activities and interests.
BBMK assisted Legislative Legal Services in coordinating TLRC staff tour of the B line and
RTD’s presentation to TLRC on October 5th 9:00 am for our regularly scheduled briefing to the
committee. BBMK will report back on any bills drafts taken up during the TLRC meeting.
BBMK attended Chamber briefings regarding Mobility study and transportation infrastructure
investments.
BBMK continues to monitor ballot initiatives for any potential implications to the district.
In September the Joint Budget Committee will hear the revenue forecast. This forecast will be
helpful to determining the impact of the BP case on future budget work for FY 2017.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: SEPTEMBER 6, 2016



With the end of the fiscal year (September 30) approaching, none of the twelve FY 2017
appropriations bills have been passed by both the House and Senate. It is widely anticipated
that both chambers will pass a short-term continuation of current-year funding levels for all
government programs and agencies by September 30, so there will not be a government
shut-down. The length of this short-term spending bill is still unclear, but the current
thinking is that House and Senate GOP leaders will have sufficient support to pass a 3month bill to carry programs until the Lame Duck session after the November election, over
any objections of Freedom Caucus conservatives who seek a 6-month CR into the Spring.
In November, Congress would then likely pass a full-year omnibus appropriations bill for
the remainder of the fiscal year.



Transportation Spending: FAST Act-funded surface transportation programs, including all
transit formula and New Starts grants, would likely be continued at current-year funding
levels under a short-term appropriations bill.

Presidential Candidates’ Transportation and Infrastructure Proposals:


Both major Presidential candidates have ambitious plans to dramatically increase
transportation funding to begin to close our infrastructure investment gap and improve
highways, transit systems, ports, waterways, and airports.
o Hillary Clinton has proposed a 5-year, $275 billion package that she pledges to advance
in the first 100 days of her term in office. Her package includes:


$250 billion in “direct public investment,” which likely means formula grants.
Clinton’s proposal seeks to, among other goals, “prioritize and increase investments
in public transit.”



$25 billion for a national infrastructure bank, which is a low-cost loan program much
like TIFIA but including all modes of transportation.



A renewed and expanded Build America Bonds (BABs) program. BABs were tax
credit bonds available in FYs 2009 and 2010 under ARRA. In the previous BABs
program, States and municipal agencies issued taxable debt and receive from the U.S.
Treasury each year a payment equal to 35 percent of their interest payment to
bondholders. For most public issuers, BABs offered a meaningful cost savings over
traditional tax-exempt debt and gave issuers access to the much larger market of
investors in taxable debt.

o Donald Trump has pledged to provide “at least double” the funding of Clinton’s
proposal, which would be $550 billion, backed by contributions from citizens and
investors to a fund to pay for transportation projects. He has said he would provide the
funding through “infrastructure bonds.”


Both infrastructure bills must be paid for in some way: tax increases, spending cuts, or
borrowing (issuing debt). Both proposals provide few details on this subject; Clinton says
she will pay for her proposal with “business tax reforms” and Trump’s proposal would rely
on borrowing: issuing bonds, the proceeds of which would be earmarked for infrastructure
projects.

BACKGROUND
After the recession in 2008, funding became tight and RTD and the Board looked at various options to

In late 2009, RTD established a Sales and Use Tax Peer Review Working Group to examine RTD’s
methodology for forecasting sales and use tax. The Peer Review Working Group consisted of members
from CDOT, RTD, RTD Citizen Advisory Committee, BBC Research, Development Research Partners,
Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB), City of Arvada, Coalition for SMART Transit, DRCOG,
Colorado Legislative Council, Jefferson County, Douglas County, City of Thornton, City of Lone Tree,
and City of Lakewood. This Peer Review Working Group ultimately led to RTD hiring the Leeds School
of Business, University of Colorado, Business Research Division (BRD).
In addition, in 2010 RTD considered going to the ballot for a revenue increase however, in April 2010
the Board decided the timing was not right.
In November 2010, RTD formed the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011.
On December 19, 2012, the Board approved the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).

The FISA identified eight highest value recommended opportunities from the Risk Allocation
Matrix (RAM) they were:
 Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support the base system operations at
the rate of inflation as define by CPI – Estimated at $24 million by 2017
 Reduce FasTracks minimum unrestricted fund balance – Estimated up to $72 million by
2017
 Reduce FasTracks O&M fund balance from 3-2 months – Estimated at $10 million by
2017
 Defer SW Corridor UPRR relocation – Estimated at $9 million by 2017
 Work to achieve underruns on FasTracks projects under construction – Estimated at $15
million by 2017
 Sell or lease of RTD properties – Estimated at $20 million by 2017
 Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the 2.5% level – Estimated
by 2017 TBD
 Sales Tax Parity – Estimated at $127 million by 2017
All Expenditures are subject to Board Approval
All funding identified through the process will be added to the FISA until enough funding is
accumulated to complete and operate additional projects
The Board confirmed the following project goals
 Completion of the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;
 Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd;
 Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private
sector contributions for FasTracks partially funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion)

In October 2015, a briefing was given to the Board regarding the status of the FISA. At that briefing the
differences in estimates from the 2012 estimates and the current projections were discussed, see chart
below, as well as the fact that the FISA was used to balance the 2015 APE and most likely would be
needed to balance the 2016 APE and financial plan.

DISCUSSION
The FasTracks financial plan incorporates updated revenue forecasts that show a decrease in short and
medium-term revenue forecasts for both FasTracks and the base system. With these updated forecasts,
annual revenues are projected to be lower than the 2015 APE forecasts in each year through 2025. In
addition, the total cumulative revenue forecast is lower than the 2015 APE forecast through 2034.
Between 2035 and 2040, total forecast revenues are projected to be higher than the 2015 forecast.
This reduced revenue forecast is expected to have multiple impacts on the financial plan. RTD’s net
debt service coverage is expected to be close to the 1.20x Board policy limit through 2022. As a result,
once the remaining FasTracks debt approved in May 2016 is issued, RTD will not have the capacity to
issue additional bonds or Certificates of Participation (COPs) until 2023. At the last Board meeting, staff
presented a plan where the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) and base system funding was
utilized to fund FasTracks corridor operations and maintenance between 2020 and 2030. After 2030,
FasTracks revenues are projected to cover all operations and maintenance of the FasTracks corridors.
At that time, positive fund balances begin to accumulate on both the base system and FasTracks, with
the larger share accumulating on the base system.
There have been questions as to why staff made this recommendation to utilize the FISA and not utilize
other reserves and/or cut service. Staff is presenting those other options that were reviewed prior to
making the staff recommendation to the Board for discussion in this Board report.
There are three alternative scenarios being presented in additional to the Baseline Scenario that was
presented last month. They are:
 Backfill from Base Reserves
 Backfill from FasTracks Reserves first and then Backfill from Base
 Backfill from FasTracks Reserves and FasTracks Operations and Maintenance
Baseline
 Need to take a total of $130.8 from the base in 2024-2030 to balance FasTracks
 Issue COPs in base in 2023 only for $59.2 million for bus purchases rest is pay go through 2040
 Build Board appropriated and operating reserves in base systems to maintain equivalent of 3
months of operating reserves consistently through 2040
 FISA is utilized to balance FasTracks in years 2021-2024
 Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months O&M
 End of 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance of $1,352.2 million, FISA $0 and FasTracks
unrestricted fund balance of $539.6 million for a total of available balance of $1,891.8 million
Backfill from Base Reserves
 Need to take a total of $336 million vs $130.8 from the base
 Need to increase COP issuance in base from $59.2 million to $239.6 million
 Reduce Board appropriated and operating reserves in base systems significantly see chart below
