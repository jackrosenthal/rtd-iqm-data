## II. 2014 Requested Budget Plan (High Level - Scarpino)

Terry Howerter noted that this is an introduction to RTD’s budget process.  He asked Jannette to review the Power Point presentation that is available in the August 27, 2013 Study Session agenda packet.

Jannette Scarpino explained that she will review the budget process and assumptions moving into 2014.

RTD’s vision and mission are the focal point for the budget development.  The budget development includes 7 elements: Vision/Mission, 2014 Budget Theme, SBP Summary, 2014 Budget Assumptions, 2014 Budget Targets, Sources and Uses, and Next Steps.  The budget development also includes safety and cost effectiveness (a keystone for finance and also for meeting future needs).   The 2014 budget theme is one of cautious optimism.  While it might be an overused term, staff is optimistic that RTD can meet our challenges while being sustainable.  Jannette Scarpino communicated the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s definition of fiscal sustainability:

Fiscal Sustainability is a government’s ability and willingness to generate inflows of resources necessary to honor current service commitments and to meet financial obligations as they come due, without transferring financial obligations to future periods that do not result in commensurate benefit.

Jannette Scarpino summarized the strategic capital and operating plan for the Base System 2014 through 2019.

The key elements of 2014 budget are as follows:

- No proposed fair increase scheduled

- Sales/use tax increase of 4.5% over 2013 projection

- Operating expenses inflated at 2.3% CPI over 2013

- Diesel lock $3.26/gallon unchanged from 2013 (current 2014 futures price is $3.30/gallon);

- Gasoline average cost of $3.54/gallon unchanged from 2013

- FasTracks service increase (rubber tire service) up by 2.3% CPI over 2013, savings contributed to FISA FasTracks Internal Savings Account

- Investment income up moderately due to higher investable balances and interest rates

- Base capital and expense projects inflated at 2.3% CPI over 2013

- No planned debt issues for Base System, 2014 fleet purchases funded by COPS issued in 2013

- FasTracks planning to draw up to $220 million in previously issued debt

- Planned increases to fund balances

Jannette Scarpino stated that the 2014 Budget Targets are broken out by department/division and show anticipated operating expenses, expense projects, capital projects and the West Line allocation.  The totals agree with the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).  At this time the departments have made their initial budget submissions within these targets.  She noted that Denver Union Station (DUS) operations appear for the first time in 2014; while this is considered a Base cost at this point the FasTracks financial plan does provide for some operating costs.

Jannette Scarpino stated that the FasTracks Project Administration budget are preliminary targets since these were not originally programmed into the budget.  These amounts exclude the West Line; staff will develop capital costs and bring them forward as the budget evolves.

Jannette Scarpino pointed out that the West Line operations have characteristics that are more like the Base System.  Staff derived expenses from our cost model and are allocating those costs based on resource drivers such as car miles, Park-n-Rides, # of elevators, etc.

The 2014 Budget Calendar – Next Steps are as follows:

- September 10, we make presentation of the 2014 requested budget to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee

- October 12/13, there will a public posting of the 2014 requested budget for review

- Oct 15, we provide a budget update for any revisions to be made to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee

- November 12, there will be a presentation of the 2014 Recommended Budget to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee to forward to the Board

- November 19, we have a public hearing and Board adoption of the 2014 Budget.

Director Tobiassen noted that just before the meeting, there had been a question from a member of the audience about operating expenses.  He asked Jannette Scarpino to read the breakdown of operating expenses for the audience so they would have an understanding of what it costs to operate RTD and how much we budget for each function.

Jeanette Scarpino read the following line items rounded to the nearest million:

- Bus Operations                                          $110 million

- Private Carrier Operations                            $105 million

- Access-a-Ride                                           $44 million

- Rail Operations                                          $36 million

- Planning                                                         $1.4 million

- Capital Programs                                           $3.3 million

- Safety Facilities                                           $45 million

- General Council                                           $8.8 million

- Finance and Administration              $34 million

- Communications                                          $11 million

- Executive Office                                           $4.9 million

- Board Office                                                         $990 thousand

- Non-Departmental                                          $5.5 million

Director Tobiassen highlighted that our total operating expense is about $410 million and Access-a-Ride is close to $44 million.

Director Tobiassen asked for an update of how RTD is doing meeting the goals of the Sustainability Task Force report.  He asked for an update specifically about monetizing parking now that the law has changed.  Director Tobiassen also asked if there is a strategic plan as to how we will monetize parking.  Terry Howerter stated that there was an update presented at the August 13, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit committee.  He explained that the parking was on the list of goals that had been accomplished by getting legislation passed but RTD had not moved forward since then.  Marla Lien explained that the parking legislation that was passed does not allow RTD to get revenue from parking; there is no monetization.  She stated that RTD can now allow a 3rd party to build and operate parking.  This could result in a reduction of expenses but will not result in a receipt of funds.

Director Folska asked for an explanation of investment income.  Jannette Scarpino explained that typically when RTD issues debt we do not spend the proceeds immediately so these funds are available to invest.

Director Folska believes that as we move forward with the Fare Task Force it will be very important to have a fully integrated parking fee and fare conversation.  She thinks it is a very complex issue and she does not want to discourage ridership.  Director Folska wonders if there should be a long term parking strategy that the Board might approve.

Director Folska notes that the price per gallon is estimated at $3.25 but the actual cost is $3.30.  She said that it does not sound like a lot of money but could have significant consequences for the budget.  She asked if staff has any feelings about the conflicts in Egypt and Syria affecting fuel prices.  General Manager Washington said that staff is monitoring the situation; it could have an impact but right now staff does not see the 12 month futures changing.

Director Sisk asked who makes the decision regarding the diesel lock.  He also asked what the fuel lock for last year was and the future for gas is. Terry Howerter explained that our Procurement division monitors contracts in place as well Suncor; they also look at the markets all the time as far as the future prices of barrels of oil.  He said that normally there is a group that evaluates this information made up of Phil Washington, Bruce Abel, Brian Iacono, John Dawson and himself.  Terry Howerter stated that the final authority rests with General Manager Washington as to when RTD executes a fuel lock.  He noted that we are currently locked at $3.34 and the future is for $3.30.  Terry Howerter said that staff does not normally monitor the gas futures like they do diesel as it is a much smaller amount in the budget.  He stated that last year the diesel price was locked in during August or September so there was budget certainty when it came time for the Board to approve it.

Director Menten asked for some examples of what would be considered operations and where physically these operations would be happening related to Denver Union Station (DUS) expenses.  Jannette Scarpino stated that this is mostly security costs throughout the facility as well as maintenance.  She said that she would provide Director Menten with a detailed list.  Terry Howerter explained that staff looks at incremental costs; as we move out of a 10 bus facility at Market Street Station to a 22 bus facility there will be higher security, maintenance, snow removal, etc. costs.

Dave Genova commented that as far as locations, it would be the Light Rail platform, bus facility, surface maintenance requirements in the Commuter Rail facility, the front of the historic building on the Wynkoop side, elevators, etc.  Director Menten wondered what organizations were involved in the negotiations for maintenance of DUS; she wonders if it includes the City County Denver, DUSPA, special districts, etc.  Marla Lien explained that Terry Howerter was talking about internal negotiations between him and Rick Clarke.

Director Folska asked for information about what is going on with Greyhound.  General Manager Washington said there was nothing staff was aware of.  Marla Lien said that many years ago during the planning of DUS there were conversations with Greyhound about creating a facility adjacent to or at DUS.  There was a high cost associated with that; the public sector could not pay for it and Greyhound did not want to pay it.

## III. Communications Update (Reed)

Scott Reed thanked Chair Anderson the Board for the opportunity to give their annual update; there is a great deal of information to cover so Scott Reed asked that all questions or comments be held until after the presentation.

The Communications Department is made up of 6 different divisions; however since Internal Audit reports administratively to communications and report to the Board through the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that division will not be reporting as part of the presentation.

Scott Reed introduced Will Adams, the Senior Manager for the Customer Information Division.  Will Adams stated that the Division consists of several different units.  He stated that his team focuses on customer information but also on customer care; they are really focused on taking care of the customers and helping them understand how to utilize RTD to their best advantage.

Will Adams stated that the first unit, Customer Sales and Information, handles the ticket sales and information.  Tickets sales increased steadily from 2010 to 2013 to $6.7 Million through June; annualized would be a much higher number.  Will Adams explained that there has been a large increase this year due to TSA moving from EcoPasses to TransitPasses.  Now DIA employees are purchasing their passes at the fare counters.

Will Adams also mentioned the Special Discount Card Programs for seniors and disabled individuals.  From 2009 going forward, these programs have been gaining in popularity and are being used on a fairly regular basis.   The volume of cards issued in 2013 will be 5,500.

He stated the Customer Service division is working closely with Light Rail and Bus operations.  There are the 5 individuals dedicated to researching all the complaints.  In 2012 there were 35K complaints and commendations with 2,300 being commendations.  Will Adams believes that number is significant.  2013 projections for the full year are estimated to be about 36K.

The Telephone Information Center (TIC) unit is the largest unit of the Customer Information Division.  Will Adams stated that in 2013 he anticipates the TIC will have over 4.175 million calls from our metro area riders.  This is a fairly substantial number.  1.9 million will be handled by the automated MyStop System.  The 2.2 million remaining calls will be handled by agents themselves.

Will Adams pointed out that the TIC experienced a hike in talk time when the West line opened; about 16-second talk time on average with people getting acclimated to our changes, major expansion of the rail, trying to explain the West line area now, etc.

MyStop continues to be very well used by RTD riders. In 2010 1.8 million calls were handled, and in 2013 there have been 2.2 million calls so far.

Will Adams stated that we are replacing the MyStop IVR with a new unit; There is no change in functionality but we do need to make sure the new system works as well as or better than the old system.

Will Adams noted that more and more customers are communicating with RTD via email.   Mostly, the customers have basic questions but the questions cannot be ignored.  Email is becoming a preferred method of communicating with RTD.

Will Adams stated that he been here for 3 months and is making a lot of cool changes.  He is working on a redesign of the special discount program by possibly implementing a mail-in application.  Currently RTD require that applicants visit one of our 3 locations, but that is not always practical.

There is a lot going on in the Telephone Information Center.  Will Adams shared that the TIC will be converting from Microsoft Outlook, which is currently used as the RTD customer service email to ZenDesk.  This application is more customer service oriented.  Will Adams explained that it will enable him to do aggressive reporting so he can analyze what is really happening.  He is hoping to improve the response time and also interface more with social media, which is currently being managed by the Marketing division.

Will Adams said that his team is also working on improving the TIC’s software and hardware technology.

Will Adams shared with the Board that his goal is a one-and-done service delivery with the objective being a one-call resolution.  This means giving out correct information the first call rather than providing wrong data and creating additional customer service calls.  In planning for future, we have 60 telephone agents, and 39 desks.  Sometimes it takes more than 39 agents to answer call volume during day.  Will Adams explained that he and Scott Reed are working on how to increase capacity for the call center.

Will Adams stated that MyStop is moving to a new IVR system next month as the current IVR is quite dated.  The vendor we are moving to has a much better application.  Later this year or early next year, a user can text MyStop with the bus stop number and can get the next departure times for that location.

Director Daly confirmed that Will Adams from TIC took over Joe Berdaus’s position and welcomed him aboard.  Director Daly stated he was very pleased with his presentation and the information regarding commendations.

Sherry Ellebracht stated that since the Government Relations present to the Board she will just present a high level overview.   She reminded the Board that when she talks about our lobbying contracts/contractors, she is also talking about the relationships that they have.  Our contractors have excellent reputations both in Colorado and at the national level.  Federal lobbying efforts are managed with Patton Boggs, State liaison efforts are through Brandeberry~McKenna, and our local government liaison efforts are through CRL Associates.

Sherry Ellebracht said that RTD had a very successful state legislative session.  Two bills we needed got passed: House Bill 12-1272 – Sales tax parity with the State of Colorado, and Senate Bill 13-027 – third party parking.  A 3rd bill, Senate Bill 1348, was passed.  This was not put forward by RTD but will benefit RTD by allowing local governments to use their share of HUTF funds if they choose.  Sherry Ellebracht stated that she looks at every bill that is introduced. This session there were about 700 bills and resolutions.  She works with Marla Lien to vet significant bills, and other bills that they keep an eye on, in terms of reviewing the legality of these bills. There were 22 significant bills and 66 bills of lesser impact to RTD.

Sherry Ellebracht stated that during the session she was working with Brandeberry~McKenna and CRL.  They are very good at having a pulse of what is happening in the state/local governments and keeping us informed.

Sherry Ellebracht shared that she also prepared the FY 2014 appropriations booklets, and shortly will begin preparing FY 2015 appropriations booklets.  She stated that she attends many meetings where RTD needs to have a presence. She works on grand openings and events where we have other local or federal officials in attendance.

Lisa Trujillo, Acting Public Relations Manager was introduced by Scott Reed.  Lisa Trujillo commented that the Public Relations (PR) division is fairly new as it was just formed in 2011.  The Public Relations Team consists of 2 staff, being Lisa Trujillo and Julia Yugel.  She stated that the Public Relations team is currently recruiting for their Annual Intern, and hope to have an Intern on board sometime in October.  There are also two open positions that they are working to fill.

Lisa Trujillo explained that Public Relations handle both internal and external communications.  She stated that their role is to anticipate, analyze, interpret and influence public opinion and to assess needs.  This is a proactive approach to anticipate needs before the public is impacted.

Lisa Trujillo said that PR counsel management on policy decisions and public implications.  It is important that they are in constant communication with the Board and management, working together on these matters.

Lisa Trujillo stated that Public Relations regularly research, measure and evaluate efforts to inform public understanding, helping to enable RTD’s continued success; and that Public Relations plan, manage, hire, train and collaborate with limited resources (a team of 2) to achieve all the above.

Lisa Trujillo advised that internal communications are just as important as external communications.  Internal communication highlights include: Monday Morning Q, Intranet “the Hub” where events are posted as is the employee of the month, and RTD on the Road. External communications include Media Relations, Special Event support, Public Outreach, Social Media and Internet.  She stated that Public Relations are in constant communication with all the different stakeholders/shareholders.

Scott Reed introduced Pauletta Tonilas, Public Information Manager.  Pauletta Tonilas introduced two new team members: Libby Winter and Melissa Dubinski. Libby Winter was hired to work on the North Metro with Brenda Tierney and Melissa Dubinski is the permanent PI Senior Administrative Assistant.  Pauletta noted that Melissa Dubinski was previously the temporary person in her position and Lindsey Winter was a contractor.  She believes it is wonderful when there are people who can prove themselves in that capacity and then earn a spot on the team permanently.

Pauletta Tonilas explained that the PI team is a combination of RTD and consultant staff.  Vertigic helps her team implement the day-to-day activities on FasTracks.  There is also a combination of consultant and staff that is assigned to specific projects as PI liaisons.

Pauletta Tonilas stated that DBE/SBE Outreach is something her team is really trying to pump up.  They have been utilizing Sherman Hamilton’s network within the DBE/SBE community to optimize communication about successes and opportunities.

Scott Reed introduced Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing.

Tony McCaulay shared that Marketing is made up of 5 different groups: Marketing Communications; Creative Services; Market Research; Sales and Contracts; and Events.

The research group conducts the customer satisfaction surveys.  There is a customer panel that consists of 1 member per district (15 total) that meets 4 times per year.  He explained that this panel will be presented with marketing campaigns and various other items to review, get customer feedback.

Scott Reed stated that all our advertising is done in-house, which is very unusual.  Years ago RTD had an ad agency that we contracted with externally and RTD spent a great deal of money for our advertising.

Steve Reilly, Manager of Marketing Communications, stated that he and Cheryl Holmes, Manager of Creative Services, co-manage the Marketing Division.

He reiterated that RTD’s advertising is all done in-house.  Scott Reilly reviewed the West Line advertising campaign with the Board.  The theme of the campaign was West meets Modern.  The advertisements used bright colors and iconic-graphics to deliver the message about what was coming, when it was coming, and where it would be located.    He stated that the campaign used traditional media tactics and digital media.  There were over 6 million impressions in advertising print as well as over 75K direct mail pieces.  Steve Reilly explained that the call to action was “Come to parties, come to grand openings, and mail in for free coupons”.  There were also advertisements on shuttles, buses and light rails.  Online advertising represented 4 million impressions on various websites throughout RTD’s service area.

Steve Reilly shared that the team hit the streets and did really fun events like temporary tattoos of all icons and all graphics.  The other fun thing was the first concert on the train; RTD partnered with KBCO and had from the lead singer from the Fray. Steve Reilly believes it was a fantastic event and an exciting way to get the word out.

The team has gone to great lengths getting tremendous exposure.  They are continuously working on new opportunities.  Steve Reilly shared that they launched new look/feel this past February for the website.  He also shared that social media has blown up over past 2 years. He said that they are using more and more digital tools in addition to traditional promotional efforts to reach constituents however they can.

Steve Reilly shared that the Marketing Division won three APTA AdWheel awards.

Director Menten asked how the commendations where passed down to employees.  Will Adams advised that the Division Managers prepare certificates that are given to the employees.

Director Menten asked how many monitors in the field are riding trains or buses that are plainclothes monitors.  General Manager Washington stated that they would get her the information.

Director Menten also asked about the conversion cost from Outlook to ZenDesk.  Will Adams reported the cost would be approximately $80/month per user. Director Menten wondered if ZenDesk could be expanded to include our GMR process.   She wants to make sure we look at Zen Desk to use in other functionalities to more appropriately address customer concerns.  Will Adams stated that ZenDesk is very robust and staff will look at what other functions it can be used for.

Director Menten asked how the customer panel is appointed.  Tony McCaulay stated that there are not appointees.  People apply to be on a panel and then staff selects a panel of 15 members, one per board district.   The goal is to replicate that of RTD’s riding public, same percent of male/female population; same educational levels, etc.  Tony McCaulay stated that we ask for applicants online and through the Read-n-Ride newsletter.

Director Menten noted that advertising can be controversial, especially in certain industries such as Cannabis, breweries, religion, etc.  She asked how we make decisions on what advertising is allowed on our vehicles.  Tony McCaulay answered that we follow strict advertising standards.  Advertising cannot be illegal or obscene.  The product has to be a commercially available product.  For instance, there is no tobacco advertising, because that is federal law.  A team reviews the product for advertising.  Marla Lien reiterated that the advertising must be for a product; if it is not for a product the ad must state who is delivering the message.  Director Menten asked if we get into station naming do we have any stations that we would consider keeping the location versus allowing a corporate name.  Tony McCaulay answered that stations could have a combinations name with a corporate name in addition to the location.

Director Rivera-Malpiede believes the entire marketing department is phenomenal.  She stated that when she thinks of the caliber of work performed on behalf of our constituents it is just amazing.  She thanked the marketing team so much and stated that she was very thrilled to be associated with such a high caliber of people.

Director Sisk thanked the marketing team and commented that the number of touches is really incredible.  Director Sisk expressed that he was a little concerned that there are two vacancies in the Public Relations department.  He questioned why we have 2 vacancies.  Scott Reed shared that he had just started the recruitment process for a Senior Manager of Public Information and Public Relations.  This is a new position.  He explained that since the PR Manager is a direct report to the new position they will not be hiring until the new position is filled.

Direct Walker noted that when he reads the paper, hears the radio, sees spots on the news, it seems the team is really doing a good job.  Director Walker noted that he did not hear anything about radio advertisements.  He asked how we reach that audience. Tony McCaulay stated that RTD currently does not have any budget for broadcast media.  Steve Reilly remarked that sometimes during the year we do provide seasonal or public service type announcements.  There were also some commercials leading up to the West Line opening. Tony McCaulay added that RTD have also sponsored various traffic reports.

Directed James wanted to add his congratulations to Scott Reed and the whole team.  He thanked them for the presentation and the great job they are doing.

Director James asked if we would also consider naming rights for lines instead of just the stations.  He thought it might be good for the Downtown circulator.  Tony McCaulay replied that 2 or 3 of the top assets identified are rail lines or circulators.  The decision about if they are named will be up to the Board.

Director Folska stated that she is very impressed with how well integrated the Marketing Department is with other divisions of RTD.  She is thrilled to have met Will Adams.  She said that the ZenDesk sounds so exciting, and she is thrilled Marketing is moving forward with that initiative.

Chair Anderson thanked the Marketing Team for their great presentation.  She wants the entire Marketing Team to know that she appreciates all that they do and how we reach out to the public.  Chair Anderson looks forward to the new software; she thinks it will be amazing to stand on a street corner and press button to learn next departure time.

General Manager Washington thanked Chair Anderson.  He stated that there are two things not mentioned, but that must be on radar.  The first is the Northwest Area Mobility study results.  General Manager Washington explained that not only will the outcome of the study need to be communicated but the process we have gone through also needs to be explained.  He believes it is very important to dispel the thought that we already have the results or that we have somehow manipulated them.  General Manager Washington stated that he sent an email to the Board about the Fare Task Force.  He explained that the goal of this task force is to simplify our fare policy; this will be a huge communication piece once complete.

##### a. Board Overview on Communications  final 8142013

## IV. Other Matters

Director Menten inquired about the unsolicited proposal to use our paved parking areas for motorcycle training. General Manager Washington stated that he will get her additional information.

General Manager Washington commented that the Board may recall the two prototype buses on the 16th street mall.  RTD put out a Request for Proposal about 2 years ago.  He explained that we purchased these buses, with an option to purchase additional vehicles.  General Manager Washington informed the Board that staff had just learned that the firm has filed for Bankruptcy.  He stated that the next step will is likely be to go back out with an RFP for new/additional purchases.

Director Menten noted that constituents call all the time with complaints about the buses being seriously overheated.  General Manager Washington confirmed that staff was aware of the complaints.

Director James recalled that RTD had been challenged on the unique design of the two 16th Street Mall buses.  Design Line was the only vendor that could previously accommodate RTD.  He is curious about our prospects for new vendors.  General Manager Washington commented that he thinks we will be OK finding a new company.  Since the original RFP bus manufacturers have made great strides.  He expounded that Design Line buses have been GREAT for our mall and that it is too bad we can’t get more of them.

Director James questioned if the bankruptcy was contributable to other aspects of their business. General Manager Washington stated that staff believes so.  He said that our financial folks had performed financial analysis but things were going well for them at that time.

## VI. Adjourn

Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 7:42 p.m.
