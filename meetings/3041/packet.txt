DRAFT COVID-19 BUDGET REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES
#1
Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe: We will
strive to keep our communities connected and our riders,
employees and region healthy and safe.

#2
Service reductions should not be our primary response.
We’ll be creative: We will take a balanced approach to
budget reductions and do so in such a way as to align with
our mission. Accordingly, service reductions should be
minimized so as to minimize the impact to our customers.
We will strive for a well-rounded approach by incorporating
reductions in overhead, breaking down silos and engaging
partners, and seeking creative approaches to service
delivery.

#3
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on
transit during the pandemic: We will strive to maximize
mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most
depend upon our services to access essential jobs and other
necessities, while also keeping our communities and activity
centers appropriately connected.

#4
We will support and value all of our employees. We acknowledge
our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the
public and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We
also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage
categories, because a humane work environment is valued by
RTD.
#5
Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and
expertise: We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to
decision-making for the COVID period, while planning for the midterm financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through
the Re-Imagine project, the accountability committee, and
stakeholders.

#6
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input: We will take active
measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of
CARES Act money as well as in the decision-making process for
measures we adopt to respond to ongoing COVID financial
impacts.

2.1.b

Due to the uncertain nature of the impacts of COVID-19 on both revenues and expenditures,
the Board gave guidance that they would like to approve a modified Mid-Term Financial Plan
that encompasses 2021 and 2022 at this time. However, we have prepared a six-year analysis
so the Board can see the longer-term impact of current information regarding revenues and
expenditures and the assumptions made.
Base/FasTracks Cash Flow for 2021-2016
The first page is the cash flow for the Base system (2021-2026) and the second page is the cash
flow for FasTracks (2021-2026.)
Base System Cash Flow:
Line 1:

Fare box revenue has been reduced to the percentages of the 2020-2025 MTFP
forecast specified in the chart below to account for lower ridership due to
COVID-19 and the uncertainty as to when ridership will return. These estimates
include an assumption of a fare rate increase in both 2023 and 2026 which was
deferred from 2022 and 2025 per Board direction.

Line 2:

Other operating revenue such as advertising and local service buy-ups.

Line 3:

Total operating revenue to include fare box revenues and other operating
revenue.

Line 4:

Sales and Use Tax – Based on the September 2020 Leeds forecast which includes
July actual collections.

Line 5:

Grant revenues are based on 2020 formula grant allocations. The impacts of the
2020 Census and potential RTD service changes on formula grants are not known
at this time.

Line 6:

This was excluded from this analysis.

Line 7:

This is only applicable to FasTracks.

Line 8:

This revenue is lumped in with other operating revenue in 2021-2025 Mid-Term
financial plan but is broken out in 2026 and beyond – it includes lease, rental,
and miscellaneous income.

Line 9:

Total non-operating revenue.

paid off in 2024. After these bonds are paid off, RTD will be subject to TABOR
spending limitations on the Base System.

Line 12:

These are the payments due on the COPs in the base system. COPs were issued
routinely for bus and light rail vehicle purchases prior to 2017.

Line 13:

Line 14:

This is the sum of revenue bond and COP payments.

Line 14a:

These are the funds that RTD has available to spend on operations, projects, and
assets.

Line 16:

Operating and Maintenance costs taken from the 2020 Adopted Budget and

2020.

Line 18a:

Administrative Personnel Related Changes identified through the COVID-19 fiscal
task force.

Line 18b:

force.

electric bus purchases out of the Asset Management list because we received
two grants for these buses and infrastructure. One is a federal grant and one is
from the Volkswagen settlement.

Line 28:

This is an allowance for new projects which are non-asset related.

Line 29:

We are funding 70% of the Asset Management Plan (AMP). 2021 projects have
been deferred to 2022-2026. RTD should be funding between 80% and 90% of
the list so assets don’t fall into a state of disrepair, however funding is not
available to achieve that level.

Line 30:

This is the total of lines 24 – 29.

Line 31:

Funds remaining after all expenses have been funded. These funds can be used
for funding deferred projects from the AMP or restoring service.
