#### 1. Civil Rights Committee Updates

RTD Triennial DBE Goal and Methodology

Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, shared that her team had been going through the Triennial DBE Goal evaluation.  There was a public announcement of the proposed goal on Thursday, June 9, with Chair Tobiassen and General Manager Genova in attendance.  The overall DBE Goal of 24% was submitted to the FTA for approval with comments from the public due by August 1st.  She said in addition to the public announcement, staff has also been conducting a Community Engagement Consultation Series with our various chambers that represent the DBE/SBE community.

Director Menten asked how the public could submit comments.  Zamy Silva indicated the proposed goal was published on the Civil Rights page of the RTD website where comments could be submitted.  She said comments could also be submitted directly to the FTA as well.

Director Francone asked if the chambers that staff met with only represented the Denver area or if they served the entire District.  Zamy Silva stated the chambers served DBE/SBEs that were throughout the entire RTD District.  She noted it is a federal requirement to meet with these companies one-on-one if RTD plans to have a project within their area.

National ADA Symposium

Ed Neuberg, ADA Manager, reminded the Board that this year RTD was a major sponsor for the ADA Symposium.  He said this event has been taking place for 15 years but this is the first time a transit agency has been a sponsor.  He shared that this was a well attended event with over 800 attendees representing all 50 states and even some international attendees.  He thanked General Manager Genova, Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, and Steve Reilly, Manager of Marketing Communications, for their efforts in securing guest passes for all attendees.  The guest passes were a huge hit.  He said every time someone found out he was with RTD they thanked him for the pass.  The attendees really thought it was great that a transit agency was so supportive of the Symposium.  He thanked everyone for their support as he believes it shows the magnitude of support at RTD for the disabled community.

Director Folska requested that Mr. Neuberg remember to introduce himself each time he presented to the Board so those that cannot see him will know who is speaking.

Chair Tobiassen congratulated staff on the Symposium.  He said he did not get to attend all of it but what he did was really outstanding.  Chair Tobiassen shared that the head of the Great Plains ADA Center, which runs the Symposium, told him that RTD really set the new standard for the Symposium in the future.  He reiterated that all he heard from the attendees was praise for the efforts from the RTD staff.

Committee Chair Deadwyler shared that she too attended the Symposium.  She thought it was a great event and was amazed at how much she learned.  She said she was surprised to learn that the Symposium was actually geared toward ADA consultants and how they can help make life better for those with disabilities.  She noted she met one woman who worked with a prison in Washington, D.C. and it was very interesting to learn about the accommodations made for prisoners with disabilities.

##### a. RTD Board Meeting Presentation 7-16Final

### D. Other Matters

Director Folska noted that last time Ed Neuberg presented to the Board she asked him for a history of ADA in Denver.  She thinks with this being an election year it will be very important to have for any new Board members as part of the onboarding training.  She thinks it will be important for ADA to be integrated throughout the entire training process.

Director Folska shared that she would love to see an initiative from the ADA office to address how to change attitudes and beliefs about people with disabilities.  Zamy Silva stated staff is working on a number of ADA initiatives but they are all in the development stages.

Committee Chair Deadwyler adjourned the meeting at 8:53 p.m.
