REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ____ SERIES OF 2016
(RTD Position on Senate Bill 16-123)

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-123 was introduced in the Colorado Senate on February 1, 2016, and
assigned to the Senate Committee on Transportation. The bill was heard in the Senate
Transportation Committee on February 18, 2016, and passed amended to the Committee of the
Whole for second reading on the Senate floor.
WHEREAS, The provisions of SB 16-123 prohibit the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) from requiring a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) to use a switchable transponder or
other device in order to drive on a HOV lane or high occupancy toll (HOT) lane on a state
highway on a toll-free basis.
WHEREAS, This bill will negatively impact the High Performance Enterprise’s (HPTE)
contract with Plenary Roads Denver and their revenue projections for Plenary to collect tolls
throughout the 50-year life of the contract.
WHEREAS, Prohibiting the requirement that HOV lane users carry a transponder will lead to
an increase in HOV lane use by vehicles without transponders. Adding the HOV lanes was
part of the voter-approved FasTracks program, and RTD was the single largest funding
source.
WHEREAS, Increased traffic in the HOV lane could impact the Flatiron Flyer BRT schedules
and slow the buses progress to a similar speed of the general purpose lanes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that RTD Board of Directors adopts a position in opposition
of Senate Bill 16-123.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
29th day of March 2016.

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for March 8, 2015:
1. Transportation Funding Discussions – The Colorado Contractors Association,
Associated General Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction Industry
Coalition and Move Colorado are preparing to move forward with a transportation
funding measure for the 2016 ballot. Exact elements of a ballot question are still
being worked out, including any allocations for transit funding. The Metro Mayors
Caucus will hold a special meeting on March 14 to discuss. In addition,
conversations continue about a possible state “deBrucing” ballot measure
following the Build a Better Colorado (BBCO) effort. We also are watching how
the hospital provider fee negotiations might impact both of the above.
2. CAC update – There are 5 open seats on the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee.

Media releases and other communications regarding the application process went
out last week. Applications from interested citizens are due by the end of the
month.

Board Update

HB16-1008 Roadway Shoulder Access for Buses sponsored by Reps. Winter and J Becker and
Senators Cooke and Heath. The bill passed on Third Reading in the Senate and will be sent to
the Governor and we anticipate a quick signing.
HB16-1010 Destructive Rodent Pest Release Authorization Requirements sponsored by Rep.
Priola and Senator Sonnenberg. Under current law, a person may not release destructive rodent
pests into a county without prior approval from the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission
and the corresponding county commissioners. An exemption to this requirement allows rodent
pests to be released into a county from which the animals were originally captured. This bill
removes the exemption, and requires that individuals give prior notification to any conservation
district in which the rodents are to be released. The bill is not currently scheduled for a
hearing. RTD is monitoring the bill.
SB16-037 Public Access Digitally Stored Data under CORA sponsored by Senator Kefalas and
Rep. Pabon. The bill makes modifications to existing legal requirements under the "Colorado
Open Records Act" (CORA) pertaining to the inspection of public records. The bill was
postponed indefinitely in the Senate State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on a party
line vote.
SB16-123 Free Access to High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes sponsored by Senator Lundberg and
Rep. Singer is on the Second Reading Calendar in the Senate. Senator Jones passed an
amendment that would remove the $15-dollar fee for the transponder and refund those who had
paid $15 in the past. The bill was laid over after the Jones amendment was added. The bill
prohibits the Department of Transportation or the High-Performance Transportation Enterprise
from requiring a vehicle owner to use a switchable transponder or other device in order to travel
in a high occupancy vehicle on either a high occupancy vehicle lane or a high occupancy toll
lane on a toll-free basis. BBMK would recommend RTD oppose this legislation as it could have
negative impacts to RTD’s operation in the 36 corridor.
HB16-1186 MAP-21 Rail fixed Guideway Safety Fund Grant Match sponsored by Rep. Tyler
and Senator Baumgardner is waiting to be scheduled in the House Appropriations Committee.
Current law requires 3% of the fixed utilities fund (FUF) to be sent to the general fund. HB161186 proposes diverting up to $150,000 from the transfer in order to fulfill the 20% match
required by MAP21. RTD is monitoring this bill.

RTD presented to the House Transportation Committee on Wednesday on the District’s
Paratransit Service. General Manager Dave Genova and Executive Staff Bruce Abel provided an
extensive update on RTD’s Access-a-Ride program. There were several members of the
disability community that voiced their personal experiences with the program. Mr. Abel did an
excellent job of acknowledging the challenges and the continuous willingness to work with the
disability community in order to improve RTD’s current services to this community.

1.C.3.a

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MARCH 8, 2016
US DOT Implementation of the FAST Act:


As a part of its February 16 apportionment notice for FY 2016 funding under the FAST Act,
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has published preliminary implementation
instructions and guidance explaining program changes made by the bill.



The FAST Act includes new funding thresholds for Small Starts: projects with less than $300
million in total capital costs and $100 in Section 5309 funding now qualify.
o Under these increased thresholds, the FTA now considers the Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) project to be a Small Start, not a New Start.

TIGER Grant Opportunity:


On February 23, US DOT announced the 8th round of its enormously popular TIGER
competitive grant program, which focuses on innovative projects that might not receive
funding under traditional formula grant programs.
o Congress has provided $500 million for TIGER. The program will continue to focus
on capital projects that generate economic development and improve access to
reliable, safe, and affordable transportation for both urban and rural communities.
o There are no pre-applications required this year; applications are due on April 29.

President’s FY 2017 Budget Proposal:


On February 9, the President released his FY 2017 budget proposal. For transportation, the
budget again calls for a dramatic 40 percent increase in transportation funding: $73 billion,
up from the FY 2016 authorized level of $53 billion. The majority of this funding increase
($17.9b out of $20b) would focus on reducing the environmental impacts of transportation
through a “21st Century Clean Transportation Initiative.”
o Transit programs would receive more than $6 billion in additional funding under the
clean transportation plan, including 50 percent increases in New Starts and transit
formula funding and $525 million for BRT projects in fast-growing communities.
o The budget also recommends $175 million for the Eagle FFGA. (Our request is for
$167 million).



To pay for his clean transportation initiative, the President proposes to levy a $10.25 per
barrel tax on petroleum.



This budget is a messaging piece – a way to convey the Administration’s final-year priorities –
and could only be realized through significant changes in transportation and tax laws. The
transportation proposals almost certainly will not be adopted by Congress, which has no
intention of revisiting the fundamentals of the 5-year bill it just passed in December. Also,
this Congress has proved in the past year to have no appetite for a petroleum tax or other
user fee increases to fund surface transportation programs.

Washington Fly-In and APTA Legislative Conference:


We look forward to seeing you in Washington next week!

Packet Pg. 12

Attachment: Federal Update 3 8 16 (2709 : Federal Update)

o Because the SERE has proceeded nearly to the point of signing an FFGA as a
traditional New Start, the benefits of Small Starts’ simpler project development
process may be limited.
