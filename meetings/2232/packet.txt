Date:

Board Meeting Date: January 20, 2015

Subject:

Radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s
Representative
Contract Seventh-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the
contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016).
This contract amendment is for the seventh year, which is an additional option year of the contract. The
scope and fee are renegotiated annually. The seventh-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $2,600,000
for a total contract value to date of $14,622,000.
BACKGROUND
RTD has replaced our radio and CAD/AVL system, which was originally implemented in 1993 and was
past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life. The project is expected to complete
System Acceptance Testing in the second quarter of 2015. There are many remaining efforts required
as a foundation for the extended operations and maintenance of the systems, processes and
infrastructure. Changes to the system are needed to improve functionality and adapt the system to
address Smart Media Technology (SMT) changes required by the new fare policy. The INIT system
provides the driver interface and onboard computer for the SMT system. Having a single interface saves
RTD money by eliminating cost and maintenance of duplicative hardware. Additionally, the extension of
this CAD/AVL system to provide Real-time Passenger Information (RTPI) to RTD’s Traveler Information
Systems (TIS) is an extremely complex and challenging task requiring experience and expertise that IBI
Group provides.
RTD requires extension of the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency
through the final stage of the project, planning for moving into operations, implementation of required
changes and design and implementation of RTPI. The OR will provide unique technical skills unavailable
internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.
This is a complex and dynamic project. IBI has successfully completed the work anticipated for the
earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to authorize a contract amendment for the seventh year of the
contract to continue needed support.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

This is the start of an optional seventh year of a Board-approved contract. Due to the complexity and
changing conditions of the project, each year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and negotiated
annually.
Although implementation for the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work remains to
complete system acceptance testing, review and finalize as-built documentation, complete planning to
move into operations and maintenance of the system, implement and test system changes such as the
SMT interface adjustments for the new fare policy. Additionally, providing real-time information to
passengers is a complex and challenging next phase for the CAD/AVL project.
The anticipated seventh-year activities are:
 Final system acceptance testing, which will extend into the second quarter of 2015
 Detailed review of project record documents
 Implementation of pending INIT contract amendments, addressing elements such as the interface
changes with SMT required for changes to fare policy
 Radio system capacity expansion for improved FasTracks and mountain coverage
 Integration and testing of subsequent phases of Smart Media Technology
 Developing scope of work for hardware replacement on Access-a-Ride buses
 Analyzing RTPI prediction accuracy and providing recommendations
 Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuation of Operations Plan (CoOP) update and implementation
 Requirements development for RTPI foundation for light rail
 Requirements development for RTPI delivery to General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)-RealTime (RT), Passenger Information Displays (PIDs), RTD website and interactive voice response
(IVR) systems
 General Intelligent Transportation System / CAD / Communications consultancy demands in
support of RTD operations and FasTrack activities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost to the District for amending the Owner’s Representative contract with IBI Group for the
seventh year is a not-to-exceed cost of $2,600,000. Funding has been included in the 2009-2015
Finance and Administration Department’s Information Technology Division capital and operating budget.
The contract values for the first six years is cumulatively $12,022,000 and with this 7th year addition
total award is $14,622,000.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the request for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement Project Owner’s Representative
contract amendment which will reduce risk and allow current RTD employees to continue
focusing on operating and improving the system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Attempt to accomplish the project with in-house staff. RTD staff does not have the necessary
skills or available resources to undertake this project.
If the IBI agreement is not approved and these resources are not available, the project would proceed
with a combination of Work Order contractors and RTD staff. It is likely that Alternative 2 will incur
additional cost for another vendor’s learning curve.

Long-Term Funding
§ Effective with the 2013 Fiscal Year, the Board-approved funding policy was
changed from a percent of payroll (9% cap) to the recommended contribution
amount up to a $3.1M annual cap
Ø Current funding policy is more prudent given the Plan’s decreasing active population
and resulting reduction in future expected payroll
Ø This policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding by the end of
20 years (in 2033)

§ If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment return
of 7.5% per year, and annual contributions equal the recommended
contribution up to a $3.1M annual cap:
Ø The recommended contribution is projected to decrease from $5.7M in the 2015
Fiscal Year
Ø The recommended contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1M cap through the
2022 Fiscal Year and fall below the cap thereafter
Ø The Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031 – no change from last year’s
Board presentation

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ Per the investment consultant, the estimated 2014 return on investments
through November 30th is 7.6% (net of fees)
Ø If the net return in 2014 is 7%, the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031
(no change), and RTD can expect to pay the $3.1M contribution cap through the
2023 Fiscal Year (1 year later), if all other assumptions are met

§ Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a significant
impact on projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of
the Plan’s investment performance on future costs

GASB 67/68
§ GASB 67 (financial accounting for the Plan) is effective for the Plan’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2014
Ø We will roll forward the January 1, 2014 valuation results to December 31, 2014
Ø Under GASB standards, the long-term investment return assumption must be
sufficient to pay projected benefits and the Plan’s assets must be invested using a
strategy to achieve this investment return
•

Based on the Plan’s projections and current funding policy, the Plan’s assumed net
investment return of 7.5% satisfies the new GASB standards

§ GASB 68 (financial accounting for the Employer) is effective for RTD’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2015
§ We will provide the applicable disclosure information for the Fiscal Year ending
December 31, 2014 (GASB 67 for the Plan and GASB 27 for the Employer) in
the first quarter of 2015

Ã If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment

return of 7.0% per year, and annual contributions equal those stated in the
tentative agreement:
• Assets will be fully depleted by 2036

Ã Per the investment consultant, the estimated 2014 investments return is 4%
• Incorporating this into the above projections, assets will be fully depleted by 2035
• To reach 100% funding by 2044, assets would need to earn 15% per year through 2020

Ã In 2014, Society of Actuaries released new mortality tables
• Current tables based on national data up to year 2000, new tables based on data to 2014
• New tables assume members will live longer than under current tables
• Future valuations will eventually need to move to new tables or a more conservative

assumption than currently used; will increase normal cost and liabilities
