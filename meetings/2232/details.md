#### 1. Radio-CAD/AVL Owner’s Representative Contract Seventh-Year Amendment

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016).  This contract amendment is for the seventh year, which is an additional option year of the contract.  The scope and fee are renegotiated annually.  The seventh-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $2,600,000 for a total contract value to date of $14,622,000.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO), introduced Eric Farrington, Information Technology (IT) Program Manager and Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for IT.

Eric Farrington presented the Recommended Action to the Directors.  He explained that although the implementation for the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work remains.  The addition of Real-time Passenger Information (RTPI) to passengers is a significant piece of the seventh year amendment.   This item will require the assistance in staffing and expertise from IBI.

Director Folska recalled the update Nadine Lee, Project Manager for US36, gave during the FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting on January 6, 2015.  She said that Nadine Lee mentioned adding RTPI to the stations along the Flatiron Flyer.  Director Folska wondered if these two RTPI items were.  Eric Farrington answered that they are the same item.  He said the technology will help inform where a bus is and predict arrival.  Director Folska hopes that low vision and no vision constituents will be able to access the RTPI.  Eric Farrington replied that his team has a meeting scheduled for the next week to explore those options.

Director Bagley asked if staff expected the work in the contract to be completed in 2015.  Eric Farrington said that staff expects everything on the primary contract will be completed.  He noted that there will be some contract amendments that would be more long term, such as the execution of the RTPI data.  Eric Farrington added that he expects staff to have enough experience on how the system works that he does not anticipate needing IBI after this contract.  He does expect smaller contracts with other vendors.

Director Bagley asked about the final contract amount for 2014.  Eric Farrington said that the number was near $2.6 million but did not have the exact number available.  Director Bagley requested staff provide  that amount prior to the Board meeting.

Director Francone inquired regarding the system’s consistency with the Disaster Recovery plan approved by the Board of Directors on December 16, 2014.  Eric Farrington said that some of the approved amount for Disaster Recovery was used for Disaster Recovery implementation through IBI.  Director Francone stressed the importance of the CAD/AVL system communicating with the Disaster Recovery system.  Eric Farrington replied that the CAD/AVL system was the first leg of the Disaster Recovery system.

Director Deadwyler noted that she gets calls from constituents when buses or trains are missing because there is no current communication to let the public know this information.  She wondered how this system will communicate with the community and when it would go live.  Eric Farrington replied that currently customers can call Customer Care to get real time information on buses and light rails.  The program in development for next year is working on bus location and predicted arrival that the customers could obtain themselves.  He explained that the program’s foundation is being laid this year and a mobile application would probably be available in 2016.  He added that this information would be available at the train stations by the end of the year or January/February 2016 at the latest.

Director Deadwyler expressed her hope that this type of communication would be available to those with sight impairments.  Eric Farrington reiterated that staff has a meeting scheduled in the coming week to explore accessibility options.  Director Deadwyler clarified that currently it is up to the constituent to call Customer Care to find out information about the buses as opposed to information being pushed out to the constituent.  Eric Farrington affirmed the statement.

Chair Sisk stressed the importance of the mobile application.  He wanted to confirm his understanding that the mobile application is not possible at this time.  Eric Farrington explained that in order to make the RTPI public there needs to be a foundation layer developed.  This is what the team is currently working on.  He added that there will be a presentation to RTD’s Senior Leadership Team (SLT) later in January, 2015.  After that presentation, there will be an update to the Board of Directors.  Chair Sisk noted that other cities have similar mobile applications available.  He stressed the importance of aggressively working towards the mobile application as it will be instrumental in keeping the constituents informed.  Eric Farrington replied that staff wants to make sure that the public RTPI will be accurate.  He added that the only thing worse than no information is bad information.

Director Lasater expressed his discontentment with this contract.  According to his conversation with staff, the contract breaks down to a fee of $135-$140 per hour based on a scenario of 9 people working on the project full time.  Director Lasater said he understands General Manager Phil Washington’s credo of not hiring staff who will need to be let go.  However, he added that seven years is a long term project.  He noted that instead of contracting RTD should be training its own staff to do this job internally, making the project cheaper.  He said that this project was unfortunately approved before he was elected as a Director.

Director Folska noted that the Customer Care Center has always been helpful and accurate.  She added that sporadically there is audible RTPI on light rail platforms.  She expressed how helpful the audible RTPI is to her.

Committee Chair Walker noted that he used to consult in prior years.  He said that the consultant is not paid the full amount of the hourly fee.  He added the cost of an employee goes beyond a salary; it includes benefits, office space, and other expenses.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan Update - Doug MacLeod, Rael & Letson Consultants

Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, explained that the Board is updated annually on the pension plans.  Currently, there are 3 retirement plans: 2 for salaried employees and 1 for represented employees.  One of the salaried employee plans is a contribution plan; the other is a benefits plan.  For both salaried plans, the Board approves the annual contribution in November of the prior year.  For the represented plan, the Collective Bargaining Agreement determines the contribution.  All plans require reviews by actuaries.

Doug MacLeod introduced Terry Bright, Actuary with Rael & Letson.  Terry Bright explained that the review is for the fund status as of January 1, 2014 because the audited financials are received 4 to 6 months after year end.  Once received, a presentation is given to the plan’s Board of Trustees, then the RTD Board of Directors.  Doug MacLeod clarified that the plan’s Board of Trustees meets quarterly.  He also noted that this presentation is for the plan of those employees hired before 2008.

Terry Bright presented the RTD Salaried Employee’s Defined Benefit Pension Plan presentation included in the Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting packet for January 13, 2015.  The presentation covered the January 1, 2014 valuation highlights, the long-term funding, the GASB 67 (financial accounting for the Plan) and next steps.  He highlighted that the total participant count decreased by 12.   He also noted that the plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031 if all actuarial assumptions are met each year.

Director Folska asked Terry Bright if he was able to predict how many members the fund would have in 2032.  He said that he did not have that number at hand but could make it available.  He noted that the difference between active participants was 408 in 2013 and 382 in 2014 due to an increase in retirement numbers.  He added that these figures were included in the presentation.

Director Deadwyler noted the statement under the second bullet of the presentation on page 2 stating “The recommended contribution is projected to decrease from $5.7 million in the 2015 Fiscal Year”.  She wondered what the expected decrease was.  Terry Bright said that there is no minimum or maximum expected on this actuarial calculation.  He explained that the Board approval caps at $3.1 million, the amount used for budgetary purposes.  Director Deadwyler asked if he could predict a percentage.  Terry Bright said that he could not.

Director Lubow asked for the reasoning behind the $3.1 million cap which was established with the purpose of achieving 100% funding in 20 years.  Terry Bright replied that the 20 year amortization was done to match closely with the life of the plan in terms of the employment life of those enrolled.  Doug MacLeod added that the $3.1 million figure was based on 9% of salary contributions at the time that the recommendation was made to switch from a percentage of salaries to a fixed contribution.  The $3.1 million was the dollar amount being contributed at the time of the transition so that was the figured used so there was no adverse effect to the budget.  The goal of moving to a fixed contribution was so that the plan would be fully funded and not affected by people dropping out.  Director Lubow wondered if it was correct to say that there will be enough to pay as employees retire.  Terry Bright said that the plan has no liquidity issues.  Director Lubow had further questions that she noted she would take to staff offline.

Director Menten said that when she met with former CFO Terry Howerter in December, RTD was expected to change to a new accounting standard in 2014.  She noted from the presentation that this seemed to not be the case.  Doug MacLeod said that the goal was to adopt the new accounting standard in 2014 but the work involved pushed the adoption until 2015.  Director Menten wished that RTD would have done the steps to move to the new standards in 2014 for transparency.

Director Menten asked what percentage of employees opts for the lump sum instead of the annuity.  Terry Bright said that the actuarial assumption is 25%.  Director Menten said that according to her calculations it seems like the additional costs of a lump sum could reach up to 44%.  She asked if she was right in her calculations.  Terry Bright replied that he was not sure which figures she was using, but that he would be happy to do some calculations.  He stated that annuities are a better payout.  He noted that in the RTD plan the lump sum has a high interest rate of 7.5%.  Director Menten asked if the lump sum has always been an option or if it was recently added.  Terry Bright said that it has always been an option.  Its interest rates were adjusted in 2014.  Director Menten said that she had further questions that she would take offline.

Director Tobiassen explained that the Governance Board of the salaried plan consists of mostly employees and it also includes Director Lubow and himself.  The meetings are quarterly.  He said that he considers the fund to be conservatively managed with very reasonable investment goals.  The fund is well diversified.  He said that he would be happy to talk to any of the Board members with further questions on the fund.

#### 2. Represented Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan Update - Doug MacLeod, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company

Doug MacLeod introduced Leslie Thompson, Actuary with Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company.  She covered the presentation RTD/ATU 1001 Pension Plan as included in the Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting packet for January 13, 2015.  The presentation included plan valuation highlights, history of the funded ratio, listing of scheduled contribution amounts, long-term funding-reforms to improve the plan, and a summary.  Leslie Thompson emphasized that the plan was projected to be depleted in 2032. Due to the favorable market results in 2013, the depletion date is now projected to 2036.

Director Tobiassen asked about other retirement benefit options available to represented employees.  He also wondered if RTD represented employees qualify for Social Security.  Leslie Thompson replied that all RTD employees are on Social Security.  Doug MacLeod said that RTD provides a voluntary 457 plan.  RTD does not provide a match for the voluntary plan.  He pointed out that represented employees could also use private tools.

Director Lubow noted that the negotiated contract requirements do not correlate with the fund needs.  She asked if it is the actuary’s job to tell their clients if there is a problem.  Leslie Thompson replied that it is part of her job.  She referred Director Lubow to past reports where she noted the problem.

Director Lubow wondered why, in general, pension funds are no longer able to pay out the contracted amounts.  Leslie Thompson said that she could not comment on the more public cases, like Detroit and California, because she has not worked on their plans.  She said that based on her research and the plans she works with the main cause is underfunding.  She highlighted that the problem may seem sudden, but in general it takes quite a while to build up.  The pension plan is not the main reason for entities to go bankrupt, but they do become a problem overtime if not funded appropriately.

Director Menten asked Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications acting for Phil Washington, General Manager, if it would be possible to ask the Union to go back to the table on the CBA in order to address this issue soon.  Scott Reed replied that he could not speak on behalf of the Union.  He pointed out that the CBA was part of a lengthy process that included both RTD and Union representatives.  He said he would research this and bring an answer back to the Directors.  Director Menten wondered if the Plan Trustee meetings are open to the Board of Directors.  Scott Reed answered that they are not.

Director Anderson noted that RTD’s contribution to the Union Retirement Fund with Social Security included is an extremely high amount of money.  She said that she hopes that the Union Pension Board can work something out and that RTD would be able to help in some way.  She added that RTD looks pretty maxed out at the moment.  She pointed out that the economy is good right now so this may be the time to resolve this.  Director Anderson acknowledged that this may be something for someone smarter than her to figure out.

#### 3. November 2014 Monthly Financials Status Report - Doug MacLeod

Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, presented the November 2014 Monthly Financial Status as included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting packet for January 13, 2015.

Director Bagley reminded the Directors that these statements show the relationship between where we are and where the budget is.  He said that this is a key issue when it comes to the Fare Study.  He noted that RTD has to be very careful to achieve at least revenue neutrality or better with the new fares.  He challenged the Board to think through this matter as they study the financial statements.

Committee Chair Walker thanked Doug MacLeod for his work.  Committee Chair Walker noted that it will be interesting to see what falling gas prices will do to ridership.
