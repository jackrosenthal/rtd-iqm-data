Unanimous Consent Agenda
A. Transfer from FasTracks Contingency Reserve for Near Term Staffing for the I-225
Corridor, Segment 1
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $1,050,000 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve
to the I-225 Corridor Project budget to fund near term staffing needs for Segment 1 of
the I-225 Corridor. These funds would be replenished from the $305 million available
funding upon signing of the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle Project.
The fund transfer would take effect upon execution of the Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City of Aurora for the East Corridor.

Corridor, Segment 1, Contract No. 17-DH-006

necessary to award a contract amendment not to exceed $400,000 with Michael Baker
Jr., Inc. (Baker) to provide post-design services for Segment 1, Nine Mile to Iliff, on the
I-225 Corridor. This action would increase the current contract amount of $9,756,237
to a new contract total of $10,156,237.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the transfer of $400,000 from the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve to the I-225 Corridor Project budget to fund this work. These funds would be
replenished from the $305 million available funding upon signing of the Full Funding
Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle Project. These Actions will take effect upon
execution of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Aurora for the
