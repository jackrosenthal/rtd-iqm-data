BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-a-Ride and FlexRide Service Contracts

March 8, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
March 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into
contracts with MTM Transit, Transdev Services, Inc., Transdev on Demand and Via Mobility Services for
the provision of Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services. These contracts are for three years, with two oneyear options for a total of five years, at a total not-to-exceed cost of $296,433,073. Additionally, RTD
will reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $27,006,014 over five
years. The total five-year not-to-exceed cost for Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services and fuel is
$323,439,087.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Access-a-Ride
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed-route
public transit system also provide comparable service for persons who are unable to use RTD’s fixedroute system for some or all trips due to disability. RTD’s ADA-compliant paratransit service branded as
“Access-a-Ride” is provided exclusively through private contractors.
Access-a-Ride contracted services are performed using agency-owned and contractor-owned vehicles.
Ninety percent of the paratransit service is provided using vehicles owned by RTD; the remaining 10% is
provided through the Access-on-Demand contract, to which multiple taxi vendors are parties. Access-aRide services comprise approximately 70% of mobility services to paratransit customers, whereas
Access-on-Demand service accounts for the remaining 30%.
The current Access-a-Ride contractual structure consists of one call center contractor, one eligibility
certification contractor, three service-provider contractors that utilize RTD-owned vehicles, and one
service-provider contractor that utilizes vehicles owned by the contractor. Current contracts for Accessa-Ride services expire on June 30, 2023.

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

FlexRide
In addition to fixed-route and paratransit services, RTD also operates FlexRide demand-responsive
microtransit service in 23 service areas within RTD’s transit network, providing first/last-mile
connections along with access to essential activity centers such as grocery stores, hospitals, medical
facilities, employment sites and schools in those areas. FlexRide service is provided exclusively through
private contractors.
The current FlexRide contractual structure consists of two service-provider contractors that utilize RTDowned vehicles exclusively. Current contracts for FlexRide services expire on June 30, 2023.
Solicitation
On December 28, 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals for dedicated (i.e., provided through RTDowned vehicles) and non-dedicated (i.e., provided through contractor-owned vehicles) Access-a-Ride and
FlexRide services for six service segments:
•
•
•
•

Two segments providing 25% each of the overall Access-a-Ride service, to be delivered via
dedicated vehicles
One segment providing 40% of the overall Access-a-Ride service, to be delivered via dedicated
vehicles
One segment providing 10% of the overall Access-a-Ride service, to be delivered via nondedicated vehicles
Two segments providing approximately 50% each of the overall FlexRide service, to be delivered
via dedicated vehicles

The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and was announced via transit industry-related
publications. Proposals were due on January 31, 2023.
DISCUSSION
Following a 30-day solicitation period, six proposals were received. A panel of subject matter experts
assessed the proposals using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall
evaluations of the proposals, the panel recommends the following:
• That contracts be awarded for Access-a-Ride service, in an amount not to exceed
$228,000,060 over five years, to MTM Transit (25%) and Transdev Services, Inc. (65%)
• That a contract for 10% of the Access-a-Ride service in an amount not to exceed
$19,771,177 over five years, be awarded to Transdev on Demand
• That a contract for the provision of 100% of FlexRide services, in an amount not to exceed
$48,661,836 over five years, be awarded to Via Mobility Services
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the 2023 Budget for the provision of contracted Access-a-Ride and FlexRide
services effective July 1, 2023. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the Mid-Term

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

March 8, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
March 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2023 service
changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 as well as to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community Value.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 30 service changes proposed for May 2023 provide opportunities for bus and rail operators to vote
new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations plan for
the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan
(SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP implementation to provide
the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on-transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI): benefits and services are
provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income
and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The May 2023 service change
proposal includes two major service changes out of 30 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be

Packet Pg. 6

1.D.2

brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is included in
Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes
will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10%
more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 24 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming May 2023 runboard. Of
these 30 changes, two services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater than that
of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes are
shown in bold in the following table.
Modified Services (20 services)
(Additional trips, expanded service spans,
increase reliability)
Seasonal Adjustments (10 services)

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings:
• Of the almost 88,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes,
low-income populations represented a higher share of population than service area averages. Of
this cumulative figure, nearly 50,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.

Packet Pg. 7

1.D.2

•

The two bus routes with major service changes serve above-average low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the service area overall, low-income equity populations received a
greater increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to higher income
populations. Low-income areas had a +1.67% benefit above higher income areas. Minority
populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less) compared
to non-minority populations. However, this difference did not meet the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore no system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed changes.

Conclusions:
Although one of the major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact at the route level,
Title VI concerns are minimal at the network level when comparing the service changes between the
January 2023 and May 2023 runboards. In aggregate, a review of all routes/lines found no adverse
impacts between equity and non-equity routes/lines. Overall, the system-wide service increases have
positively impacted equity populations slightly more compared to non-equity populations. Therefore, no
system-level disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed major service
changes in the May 2023 service change proposal.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success while maintaining compliance
with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the equity implications for all subsequent
service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future
service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023

1.D.2.a

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of service changes between the January 2023 and May 2023 runboards
to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 24 bus route/patterns and six rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming May 2023 runboard. Of
these 30 changes, two services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below
have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services being
eliminated.

Service Adjustments (one service)

Route 10 – East 12th Street: extend service to Colfax and
Billings via 11th and Peoria and terminate westbound trips at
Union Station

Service Reinstatement (one service)

FF2 – Boulder Express: Reinstate service on the FF2
(Boulder Express) with three trips in each direction

Findings

Alterations to the proposed May 2023 service changes include extending the alignment of Route 10 and
reinstatement of the FF2 Boulder Express pattern of the Flatiron Flyer. Of these routes, both serve high
concentrations of low-income populations and Route 10 serves high concentrations of both minority and lowincome populations.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service changes and as a
proportion to the District overall, low-income equity populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were
more positively impacted) compared to higher income populations. Low-income areas had a +1.67% benefit
above higher income areas. Minority populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively
impacted less) compared to non-minority populations. However, this difference did not meet the Disparate
Impact threshold, therefore no system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed changes.
Finally, though there were no cumulative adverse impacts at the network level, a potential disparate impact was
identified at the individual route-level: of the two routes/lines that had major service changes, FF2 had potential
disparate impact finding but no disproportionate burden finding.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
January 2023 and May 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•

•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects

and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2017 to 2021 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the May 2023 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of census blockbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).

RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted February 21-22, 2022. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 68 community-based organizations and schools surrounding the routes/lines to inform and
encourage community members to attend the open houses. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates,
number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the three major service
changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis
Proposed service changes for the May 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service were
categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or higher income) for comparison.
Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior network
using 2017-2021 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode
As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, 21 bus routes will undergo service changes.
Of these, four routes will see an increase of bus service by over 49 total weekday revenue service hours.
Changes to Route 10 exceeded the major service change threshold and FF2 is a reinstatement of previously
suspended service; both account for almost 41 of the additional daily revenue service hours. Rail services will
have service level adjustments to increase service to midnight.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
No major reductions/eliminations.

Major Service Change Increases
Two bus routes had major service changes which include service increases of 25% or greater. This includes one
modification to alignment on Route 10 and a reinstatement of a route pattern on the Flatiron Flyer. While below
the percentage threshold, the reinstatement of service to pattern FF2 is considered a major service change and

Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority

and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual route follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Proposal: Extend route into Aurora to Colfax Ave and Billings Street via 9th and 11th Avenues and Peoria
Street. Headways between 9th Avenue and Clermont Street would be 60 minutes. All westbound trips
would terminate at Denver Union Station.
As shown in Table 4, a higher percentage of the District’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed Major Service Increase as compared to non-minority population (2.41% vs. 2.11%,
respectively). This difference does not exceed the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.90%). Therefore,
a route-level disparate impact is not found. Moreover, a higher percentage of the District’s low-income
population stands to benefit from the proposed Major Service Increase as compared to higher population
(3.30% vs. 2.06%, respectively). This difference does not exceed the 10% disparate impact threshold
(1.85%). Therefore, a route-level Disproportionate Burden is not found.

Route FF2 (Boulder/Denver) – Boulder Express
Proposal: Reinstate route pattern with three eastbound trips (7:07 a.m., 7:37 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. from
Downtown Boulder Station) and three westbound trips (7:45 a.m., 4:45 p.m. and 5:20 p.m. from Denver
Union Station).
As shown in Table 5, a lower percentage of the District’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed Major Service Increase as compared to non-minority population (0.81% vs. 0.40%,
respectively). This difference does exceed the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.73%). Therefore, a
potential route-level disparate impact is not found requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public
service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis). However, a higher percentage
of the District’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed Major Service Increase as
compared to higher population (0.93% vs. 0.51%, respectively). This difference does not exceed the
10% disparate impact threshold (0.46%). Thus, there is no Disproportionate Burden at the line-level.

Network Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program update, a network analysis is required in addition to route- and
line-level analysis. A network level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for Title
VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

10

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 49 weekday revenue hours.
Of the almost 88,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher share of population than District averages. Of this cumulative
figure, nearly 50,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.

•

At the network level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The two bus routes with major service changes serve above-average low-income
populations.

In review of Routes 10 and FF2 at the network level, there are no potential disparate impact or
disproportionate burden findings.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the January 2023 to May 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.3%) and
minority population (36.9%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2017-2021
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 36.9% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.049
million) the low-income population percentage of 14.3% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.005 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine3.
The thresholds summarized in Error! Reference source not found.6 yielded 831 (38% of all) block groups
above the district average for low-income population, and 830 (38%) block groups above the district average
for minority population.

1

Based on existence of the route within the January 2023 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2017-2021 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population and
results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter
mile of bus stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District.
This comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. No major changes were proposed for rail
services with the May 2023 runboard.

For system-level bus service changes, non-minority populations stand to benefit slightly more than
minority populations, (2.93% vs. 2.82%, respectively). However, the difference does not meet the Disparate
Impact Threshold of 2.63%. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact findings are found with the proposed
major service changes. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than higher income
populations (4.24% vs. 2.57% respectively), with low-income areas benefitting 1.67% more than higher
income areas. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service
changes.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the District,
as well as highlight the two bus routes with major service changes (orange). The Route 10 benefits low-income
and minority populations, serving the 9th and 11th Avenue and Peoria Street corridors with a longer alignment
and more connections into Aurora. The FF2 pattern of the Flatiron Flyer is currently suspended and is proposed
to be reinstated with three trips in each direction/peak period.

Summary of Findings
The network changes that are proposed between January 2023 and May 2023 include modifications to service
that include schedule adjustments, changes to summer schedules and trip availability, additional trips, and longer
spans of service. The major service change increases were entirely invested in bus services. No major service
reductions were included.
Route-level Findings:
•
•
•

Of the 30 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, one had a potential disparate
impact finding.
Route FF2 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving -0.33%
less of a benefit than non-minority populations.
Route 10 had no potential disparate impact and no disproportionate burden findings.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed May 2023 service changes4 include adding improvements to Route 10 and FF2,
both of which serve low-income populations at rates higher than the District average. These service changes
signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution of service improvements.

In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital) and recovery uncertainty serves as
justification for maintaining the May 2023 service changes proposal.
Systemwide-level Findings:

18

•

Of the almost 88,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes with a
major service improvement (Routes 10 and FF2), low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted services to low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus routes with a major service
change and as a proportion to the District overall, low-income populations received a greater
increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to higher income populations.
Low-income areas benefited +1.67% more compared to higher-income areas. Additionally, minority
populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less)
compared to non-minority populations. However, this difference did not meet the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore no system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed changes.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2023 Service Change

March 8, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
March 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the May 2023 Service Changes as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU), the May 2023
Service Changes facilitate both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments
and the opportunity for Service Development Division staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s
transit network.
Weekday boardings average slightly more than 185,000 currently, a 10% increase over 2021. Despite
growth, overall system capacity remains ample throughout the transit network, with few exceptions.
Customer expectations and agency goals outlined in the Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP)
have driven an interest toward increasing levels of service. However, current employment levels for bus
and rail operators as well as other key positions remain a challenge, limiting resources available to
operate increased services. Accordingly, the modifications for May 2023 have been arranged to leverage
seasonal changes to address maintenance needs, resulting in a limited number of service increases and
resource-neutral adjustments.
DISCUSSION
The service changes herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments. Notable changes
include an SOP-related change restructuring the Route 10 — 12th Avenue local service and as well as
the reintroduction of select trips on the FF2 — Union Station Downtown Boulder Express branch of the
Flatiron Flyer. This recommendation also supports the implementation of a new North Broomfield
FlexRide service area, which is grant funded.

Packet Pg. 53

1.D.3

Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence,
and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the changes are directed at improving on-time
performance, maintaining CBA compliance and adjusting service levels to match projected summer
ridership demand.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: benefits and services are provided without regard to race,
color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of service modifications is provided below and are detailed in Attachment A.
Reference materials related to SOP proposals are also included as Attachments B, C, D, E and F.
Summary of Public Hearings
Three virtual public hearings were conducted, on February 21, 2023, at noon and 5:30 p.m. and
February 22, 2023, at noon. These meetings have been recorded and are available for review. Written
communications and public comments collected during this public comment period have been

May 2023 Service Changes

Route 0 — South Broadway
Current average weekday ridership: 31.5 passengers per hour
Current on-time performance: 77.9% on-time, 18.4% late
It is proposed to add resources to Route 0 on weekdays to alleviate current running time
issues. A running time analysis determined there is a significant delay occurring between
Evans and Englewood stations on weekdays, in comparison with current running times
allotted to that segment. Research comprised of route review, operator interviews and data
analysis determined this delay to be primarily due to heavy passenger loads and traffic signal
timing issues. Resource impacts are anticipated to be an estimated seven weekday hours.
Route 3L — East Alameda Limited
Current on-time performance 20.8% late, 79.2% on time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time
performance are proposed. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Current on-time performance 23.9% late, 76.1% on time
Current ridership is 23 boardings per hour weekdays, 20 boardings per hour Saturdays, 16
boardings per hour Sundays
As outlined in the Board-approved System Optimization Plan (SOP), it is proposed to expand
service east into Aurora. However, the routing proposed in the SOP is not compliant with
the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit
Union Local 1001 (CBA), due to lack of sufficient options for operator respite at the terminal.
To expand service and in compliance with the CBA, it is proposed to modify the SOP and
extend the Route 10 to Colfax and Billings instead, via east 11th Avenue and Peoria Street.
Headways to the eastern terminus would be 60 minutes, as proposed in the SOP.
Further, in accordance with the SOP, all westbound patterns will terminate at Denver Union
Station. This route will no longer serve Decatur•Federal Station or the Children’s Museum
due to lack of ridership compared to the resources required to maintain such routing. The
existing headways will be maintained between Denver Union Station and 9th and Clermont.
This proposal aims to increase ridership by improving transit access and connectivity to
major activity and employment centers in Denver and Aurora. This modified routing complies
with the CBA and provides a greater benefit to Title VI populations, who are more likely to
rely on RTD services. This addresses ongoing customer requests for Route 10 service to
return east of Claremont and is warranted based on the ridership demand on parallel Routes
6, 15, 15L and 121.

BUS

1.D.3.a

Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Seasonal adjustment, discontinuing school tripper for summer. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 12 – South Downing
Current on-time performance 19% late, 76% on time
Running time analysis, schedule adjustments. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Current on-time performance 27.2% late, 72.8% on time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time
performance are proposed. Additionally, seasonal school tripper service would be
suspended. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 28 – 28th Avenue
Schedule adjustment aimed at providing a respite period and location for Routes 28 and 32
beyond 26th Avenue and Wadsworth Boulevard. Cost impacts would be shared between
Routes 28 and 32 through interlining the services, which is anticipated to be an estimated
19 hours daily and an additional vehicle.
Route 30 – South Federal
Seasonal adjustment, discontinuing school tripper for summer. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Schedule adjustment aimed at providing a respite period and location for Routes 28 and 32
beyond 26th Avenue and Wadsworth Boulevard. Cost impacts would be shared between
Routes 28 and 32 through interlining the services, which is anticipated to be an estimated
19 hours daily and an additional vehicle.
Route 34 – Bruce Randolph Avenue
Current average weekday ridership: 27.1 passengers per hour
Current on-time performance: 87.4% on-time, 12.3% late
In order to achieve further CBA compliance, it is proposed to extend Route 38 east and
connect to Route 34 at 30th•Downing Station, due to the lack of a relief station at the
current eastern terminal of route 38. Route 34 will be merged into Route 38, and the extra
recovery time currently available on Route 34 will accommodate the additional running time
necessary to merge the two routes. Eastbound routing will continue on Stout Street from

Packet Pg. 58

Attachment: May23 Service Changes_Attachment A [Revision 1] (4757 : May 2023 Service Change)

Customers who previously utilized service west of Denver Union Station will be impacted.
However, that segment of the route was discontinued with the COVID-19 service changes
and previously accounted for less than 5% of Route 10 ridership. Anticipate resource
impacts are estimated to be 34 weekday hours, three vehicles.

1.D.3.a

Stop Consolidation
Current average daily ridership on Route 34 is 720 Weekdays, 539 Saturdays, 307 Sundays
In conjunction with the proposed combination of the Route 34 and Route 38 and considering
the multimodal street improvements being made on Bruce Randolph Avenue, it is proposed
to remove two stops to improve the efficiency, on-time performance, and customer
experience on the Route 34. It is proposed to remove Stops 10944 and 10945 on Bruce
Randolph Avenue at Fillmore Street. These are legacy stops, and do not meet current RTD,
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) or Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
standards for stops. Current average daily boardings at stop 10944 is six on weekdays, five
on Saturdays, and two on Sundays. Current average daily boardings at stop 10945 is two
weekdays, none on Saturdays, one on Sundays
This will impact the existing customers that may use these stops, which is estimated to be
at most eight customers per day. However, since the distance to the next closest stop is
less than 0.1 mile, the estimated customer impact is minimal. New stop spacing will meet
the standard for local routes of roughly 0.25 mile between stops. Additionally, this change
will make the route more efficient for other Route 34 customers.
This will mitigate potential bus and bicycle conflicts with the installation of the bikeway
along the corridor.
Route 38 – West 38th Avenue
Current average weekday ridership: 21.9 passengers per hour
Current on-time performance: 79.1 on-time 20.3 late
In order to achieve further CBA compliance, it is proposed to extend Route 38 east and
connect to Route 34 at 30th•Downing Station, due to the lack of a relief station at the
current eastern terminal. Route 34 will be merged into route 38, and the extra recovery time
currently available on Route 34 will accommodate the additional running time necessary to
merge the two routes. Eastbound routing will continue on Stout from 17th Street until 32nd
Street, at which point they will turn right on Downing Street and right on California Street,
where it will enter the station. Westbound routing will leave the station on California and
will follow that until standard routing is resumed with the turn on 15th Street. The new
combined route will be named 38 — 38th Avenue Crosstown. Anticipated cost impact
neutral.

Route 169 — Buckley Crosstown
Current on-time performance 21.9% late, 78.1% on time
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at improving on-time

DASH — Boulder/Lafayette (via Louisville)
Seasonal adjustment, reducing weekday service frequency for summer. No cost impacts
anticipated.
FF — Boulder/Denver
Current On — time performance: 81.8% on-time 18.2% late
FF2 – It is proposed to add three FF2 (Boulder Express) trips, in the eastbound direction at
7:07 a.m., 7:37 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. from Downtown Boulder Station to address demand
during the peaks. Ridership on the current eastbound FF1 7:15 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. trips
average 48% of the max load or 40 passengers per trip. However, this average is calculated
over a five-day period while most of the ridership occurs on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and
Thursdays. This creates a higher ridership than the average on these three days, resulting in
overloads regularly on these days. In the evening peak, ridership averages 63 passengers
per trip, nine passengers or approximately 15% above the maximum load. More than half of
this ridership boards either at US36•McCaslin Station or prior to reaching the station. Again,
this ridership average also occurs mainly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays,
creating a higher ridership than the average, on these days, resulting in regular overloads.
It is also proposed to add three FF2 trips leaving from Union Station at 7:45 a.m., 4:45 p.m.
and 5:20 p.m. to address demand during the peaks in the westbound direction. Ridership in
the morning peak between 7:30 and 8 a.m. averages 49 passengers per trip. Ridership in
the evening peak, between 4:45 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. averages 64% of the maximum load
or 44 passengers per trip. Nearly half of this ridership deboards between US36•McCaslin
Station and Downtown Boulder Station. Again, most of this ridership occurs on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Thursdays, resulting in higher than the average ridership on those days,
creating overloads on a regular basis. A new eastbound trip at 4:15 p.m. and a new
westbound trip at 5:15 p.m. are also proposed.
FF5 — Downtown Boulder/Anschutz
It is proposed to add a 6:30 a.m. eastbound trip, from Downtown Boulder Station to
Anschutz Campus, to address the demand for an 8 a.m. shift start time and to shift the
current 7:30 a.m. westbound trip, from Anschutz Campus to Downtown Boulder Station,
to a 7:50 a.m. leave time, for interline efficiencies. Ridership on the current 7:30 a.m. trip
boards along US36 and into Boulder only, with an hourly average of 25 boardings. Shifting
the trip time would help better balance demand into the University of Colorado, Boulder for
9 a.m. class start times.

Anticipated resource impact estimated to be eight weekday hours combined between the

Seasonal adjustment, short-turn trips at Nederland High School due to Eldora Ski Resort not
being in operation. No cost impacts anticipated.
SKIP — Broadway (Boulder)
Seasonal adjustment, reduce weekday service frequency for summer. No cost impacts
anticipated.
FLEXRIDE
North Broomfield FlexRide
It is proposed to create a new FlexRide service area in North Broomfield that will operate
weekdays between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to provide transportation alternatives for those
affected by changes to Route 128. The new service area would go as far east as Washington
Street, as far south as 136th Avenue, as far west as US 287 and as far north as Lowell
Street. The primary boundaries would roughly be Washington Street, 144th Avenue, 120th
Street and Baseline Rd (Hwy 7).
The estimated annual cost would be approximately $88,151 based on current service costs;
however, as this is grant-funded, the service is cost neutral until the grant terminates on
September 30, 2025.
RAIL
D Line – 18th and California streets to Littleton•Mineral Station
Current overall ridership 89 boardings per hour; 120.4 boardings per hour Monday —
Thursday, 94.3 boarding per hour Friday, 75.4 boardings per hour Saturday, 63.7 boardings

Purpose of this proposal is to adjust service frequency by balancing service to the demand
and extending the service span to match the E Line creating coverage and spreading service
to create connections to the southwest corridor in the late evening. Balancing service is
intended to improve route performance efficiency and cost effectiveness. Intent is to offset
the D and H lines during the reduced 30-minute service to maintain 15-minute service in the
central corridor and maintain convenient transfers to the E Line for improved connectivity.

JUMP – Boulder/Lafayette (via Arapahoe)
Seasonal adjustment, reducing weekday service frequency for summer. No cost impacts
anticipated.

It is proposed:
• Monday through Thursday and Sunday service days to reduce service between 6:30
and 8 p.m. to 30 minutes from 15 minutes and move those hours to extend service
to midnight instead of 10 p.m. to provide connections from the E Line to Littleton
Mineral in the evening.
• Friday reduce service between 7:30 and 9 p.m. to 30 minutes from 15 minutes,
extend service to 2 a.m. to match E Line and provide connections to Littleton•Mineral
after 10 p.m. that currently is not provided.
• Saturday reduce service between 8 and 10 a.m. to 30 minutes from 15 minutes,
and between 7 and 8 p.m. from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and extend service to 2
a.m. on 30-minute headways to match E Line service and provide connection to
Littleton•Mineral that currently is not provided.
Impacts to existing customers includes a delay to customers during the reduced service
span. Planning service to provide connections to minimize impact to the customers.
Extending the service will provide positive impacts to the community and provide
connections later in the evening that customers have been demanding since fall 2020.
Anticipated cost impact neutral.
E Line – Union Station to RidgeGate Station
Current overall ridership 103 boardings per hour; 116.9 boardings per hour Monday through
Thursday, 101.6 boardings per hour Friday, 99.5 boardings per hour Saturday, and 93.5

Purpose of this proposal is to adjust service frequency by balancing service to the demand
and extending the service span to accommodate demand for late night service for events
and evening staff. Balancing service frequency to ridership is intended to improve route
performance efficiency and cost effectiveness while improving service span coverage.
It is proposed:
• To extend Monday through Thursday service on 30-minute frequency until midnight.
This addresses the requirement to match the increased service hours added to the
W Line per the FTA agreement requiring any increase in service to be matched on
the Southeast Rail Extension.
• Sunday to reduce service between 8 and 10 a.m. to 30 minutes from 15 minutes
due to low ridership and move those hours to the evening due to increased request
and demand for 30-minute service to midnight.
Impacts to existing customers includes a delay to customers during the reduced service
span. Planning service to provide connections to minimize impact to the customers.

RTD Service Development Staff,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on the May 2023 Runboard. We
are very happy to see partial restoration of FF2 Express service included as part of this
proposed service change. Since the latter part of 2021, as more work, essential trips, and
social trips have shifted back to in-person, our community has been pushing for restoration
of transit service that was suspended in April 2020, including express service on US 36. We
understand that the operator shortage has been the primary barrier to service restoration, so
we are excited that RTD is making headway in this regard.
We also appreciate the proposed change to the FF5 to better serve the CU-Boulder
community, which is a major transit trip generator in Boulder County.
We look forward to working with RTD staff on future service changes.
Thank you,

Alex Hyde-Wright

RE: May 2023 Proposed Service Changes - North Broomfield Flexride and Flatiron Flyer
Dear Ms. Johnson,
The City and County of Broomfield is pleased to express its enthusiastic support for the proposed North Broomfield Flexride
service area and additional service on the Flatiron Flyer.

Attachment: RTD May 2023 Service Changes - City and County of Broomfield Letter of Support (4757 : May 2023 Service Change)

1.D.3.d

The Flatiron Flyer is a critical link between communities in the Northwest Denver Metro Region. The proposed expansion of
service on the FF2 Flatiron Flyer will help relieve pressure on the highly-utilized FF1 service and increase the convenience and
reliability of the service for Broomfield commuters. The additional FF5 trip will support commuters, students, and residents
needing to access medical services at Anschutz. Broomfield appreciates RTD’s efforts to phase in the restoration of services.
Broomfield has a growing population of residents within vulnerable demographic groups who are in need of transportation
options that are safe, reliable, and affordable. Broomfield's 65+ population grew by 79% from 2010 to 2020; within the
proposed North Broomfield service area approximately 16% of the population are older adults. In addition to a large senior
population, an estimated 24% of the population are People of Color, and 5% are considered low-income. By providing a
dedicated service designed to meet the needs of residents, the proposed service changes will help promote greater access,
equity, and inclusion in our community.
The new flexride service in North Broomfield would benefit the community in many ways. For one, it would provide a
convenient and affordable mode of transportation that can be used to access essential services such as medical appointments
and grocery stores. It will also help ensure that vulnerable groups have access to the resources and opportunities that they
need to thrive.

Broomfield has high hopes for the new North Broomfield Flexride to improve mobility access and options, we hope to continue
our partnership with RTD to expand the areas served and hours of operations to support workforce trips before 9 a.m. and after
4 p.m. We request that RTD consider expanding the boundary to include the new Palisade development along Huron, north of
CO 7, as well as point deviations to support regional access at 124th/Eastlake N-Line, US 36 Flatiron, and/or US 36 Broomfield
Stations.
Broomfield continues to encourage RTD to support the impacted riders of Route 128, suspended since April 2020 and proposed
for elimination in the 2022 RTD System Optimization Plan, by expanding the operational capacity of the Broomfield Flexride. It
remains a top priority to restore Broomfield's transit access to Wagon Road Park and Ride and the N-Line station. Broomfield
looks forward to continuing to partner with RTD to optimize service, operations, and connections to regional transit facilities.

In summary, the proposed service changes on the Flatiron Flyer and the North Broomfield Flexide are vital investments in our
community's future. By supporting our most vulnerable residents and expanding regional access, we are ensuring that the
Broomfield community, and the Denver metro region, remain strong, vibrant, and inclusive for generations to come. Broomfield
urges RTD to move forward with these proposals.
Sincerely,

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Human Resources Update

March 8, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Chief People Officer Charlene Polege joined the agency on December 15, 2022. This human resources
update from the Chief People Officer is intended to be the first in a recurring series of reports to the
Operations and Safety Committee.
DISCUSSION
The RTD workforce comprises a vast array of highly skilled disciplines and roles from safety and
compliance, information technology and cyber-security, heavy-duty mechanics, service and cleaning,
maintenance, legal, financial, human resources, engineers, customer support, law enforcement, and bus
and rail operators. While not an exhaustive list, this breadth presents challenges and opportunities for
the agency.
People Power
Ensuring RTD has the right people, in the right roles, doing the right work, at the right time is critical to
the agency’s success.
Over the past nine months, the agency has enacted various strategies and tactics to support the
recovery of its people power and correlated service. At present, RTD employs 2,650 full and part-time
staff. In 2022, RTD added 708 new employees, which represents a 43% increase over 2021.
Conversely, separations (voluntary and involuntary) reduced by 34% over the same period. Metrics in
the first 60 days of 2023 continue to support this positive trend. However, while these numbers
demonstrate a shift in the right direction, RTD’s overall vacancy rate (calculated against 2023 budgeted
positions) sits at 18%, with certain work groups experiencing vacancy rates of 30-40% across the
agency in key positions, notably, service and cleaning, maintenance (general repair and body shop), light
rail vehicle maintenance, and Maintenance of Way (MOW) and infrastructure.
In considering RTD’s current projected annual turnover of one employee per day, and the total number of
vacant positions, to reach a full workforce potential, RTD’s talent acquisition team would need to hire an
additional 950 new employees in 2023. This equates to approximately 80 new hires per month.

Packet Pg. 74

1.E.1

Talent Acquisition
RTD faces significant challenges that are plain to see and state (i.e., 18% agency vacancy rate, 2.9%
Denver metro unemployment rate, a 3.6% Colorado unemployment rate) even if they are difficult to
overcome. The job market remains exceedingly tight, and the competition for talent is fierce. Not
surprisingly, talent acquisition is a primary focus at RTD. To succinctly summarize this challenge: RTD
must attract significant numbers of specialized skillsets in a short period of time, and then once hired,
provide an employee experience that makes them choose to stay. Should the agency accomplish this
goal, it will be uniquely positioned among the country’s multi-modal transportation leaders: an agency
that meets the transportation needs of the communities served, and an agency that fulfills its vision to
make lives better through connections.
In response to this challenge, and with the GM/CEO’s full support, the agency doubled the size of its
talent acquisition team, adding three additional full-time team members. With the addition of required
resources, an increase in community outreach and partnerships, and targeted recruitment efforts some
departments are returning to near or fully staffed status.
As an example of efforts to reinvest in staff resources, in March 2022, due to an extreme staffing
shortage, the agency made the difficult decision to reduce the Telephone Information Center’s (TIC)
hours of operation. Weekday hours were reduced by two hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., whereas
previously representatives were available until 8 p.m., and the center was closed on Sundays. In
December 2022, the TIC resumed 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. service, with Sunday service resuming in May.
Assisting in continued recruitment efforts, RTD has partnered with a national job posting and compliance
portal (eQuest) to assist the agency in expanding its reach (in real time) to targeted diversity applicant
pools. eQuest proudly states that, “their networks include the widest range of job posting destinations
that are specifically designated as diversity sites or job boards that include a diverse community of job
seekers.” RTD’s partnership with eQuest officially launched on February 28, 2023.
In addition, RTD continues its work with the Persons with Disabilities partnership group. A key initiative
of this group, under the leadership of RTD’s Manager overseeing American with Disabilities Act of 1990
compliance, is to challenge the systemic barriers for people with visual impairments in employment at
RTD. The goal is to create opportunity for persons with visual impairments in RTD’s Telephone
Information Center. With critical software testing complete, the agency has moved passed the proof-ofconcept and recently completed the assessment phase. Completion of this phase has enabled RTD to
identify shortcomings and prepare the implementation of mitigation strategies for future employees with
visual impairments.
Furthermore, positions within RTD have been reviewed from an equity lens, specifically to find roles that
could be open to persons with disabilities. A detailed review of position qualifications indicated that
there are several roles at the agency that can be filled by persons with visual impairments or other
disabilities.

Packet Pg. 75

1.E.1

Finally, later this month, RTD will launch a targeted military campaign designed to promote the agency
to veterans transitioning from a career in service to their country to a career of service in support of
RTD’s mission, vision, and values. The campaign was developed with the input and collaboration of RTD
veterans and focuses on military skills transfer, as well as teamwork and collaboration. Phase one is
scheduled to concluded in June 2023 and includes the creation and deployment of RTD’s dedicated
military careers page.
Retention
Of the 401 separations in 2022, only 5% of individuals indicated they were dissatisfied with their jobs.
The most frequent reason for separation cited was inadequate compensation and alternate job
opportunities. In 2022, RTD made significant advances in addressing these common barriers to
employee retention. Both represented and non-represented employee groups received compensation
adjustments that align RTD’s compensation with the market while maintaining compliance with
Colorado’s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act.
Additionally, in recognition of the importance of growth and development, the agency refocused its
efforts with respect to providing learning and growth opportunities. Through the creation of a learning
and development framework the goal of RTD’s education and development unit is to support the agency
in preparing and developing employees so they can operate to their fullest potential and by extension
advance the business goals of the agency. RTD’s learning and development (L&D) framework is now
complete. With a fully staffed unit as of February 2023, this highly skilled but small team is focused on
creating a robust suite of adult-learner based training and development products that support employees
desire for growth and the agency’s strategic plan and agency outcomes.
Utilizing the instructional design plan embedded in the learning and development framework, the L&D
unit developed and launched performance management and annual reviews training for managers. The
absence of such training was identified as a critical gap by the GM/CEO in 2021. The training was well
attended with a 75% participation rate among eligible employees. Both in-person and online training
sessions were offered. Post-training evaluations noted a 4.08 star rating out of 5 with an overwhelming
majority of respondents (>80%) affirming that “the topics covered were relevant to me and my role.”
Supplemental SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound) goal training sessions
were also offered. Both workshops will be offered on an ongoing basis throughout the year and will
comprise foundational training components of RTD’s Supervisor/Manager Training Program currently
under development.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item. The presented initiatives are
contemplated in the 2023 Budget.
