#### 1. Approval of 2016 Granite Paver Maintenance Contract Amendment for 16th Street Mall Transitway Lanes

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end date from the current end date of July 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract value by $1,000,000 to a total of $3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016 Adopted Budget.

Motion:                Director Solano made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, pointed out that this recommended action is not an additional request for funding.  RTD is committed to spend $1 million annually in maintenance of the 16th Street Mall Transitway.  The City and County of Denver (Denver) contributes up to $300,000 per year.  The recommended action asks to extend the contract with the current contractor, Gallegos, until the end of 2016.  The plan is to launch a Request for Proposal (RFP) process in 2016 to secure a new contract by 2017.

Jeff Cluphf, Park-n-Ride Construction Manager, added that the average daily maintenance of the 16th Street Mall is $3,000.  Part of the issues are caused by the 300 freeze and thaw cycles the 16th Street Mall Transitway sees on an annual basis combined with the wheel traffic.  He added that Gallegos has been diligently working on the project.  Their work has a 2 year warranty, noting that they are vested in the project.  He pointed out that the last contractor could not keep up with the maintenance so they did not submit a bid during the last RFP.  Jeff Cluphf hopes for competitive bids for the next contract.

Director Lubow wondered how the conversation of changing the mall from granite to cement fits into this recommended action.  Henry Stopplecamp replied that it does not fit in this conversation.  He explained that the recommended action is for the maintenance of the Mall as required by the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Denver from three years ago.  This IGA is a continuation of the lawsuit from the late 80’s which called for RTD maintain the Mall transitway for the next 30 years.  The process to look at alternative materials is under way.  Director Lubow asked if that process would preclude this maintenance cost.  Henry Stopplecamp replied that it potentially could if the recommendation is a concrete solution.  Director Lubow asked for confirmation that we are waiting for the alternate material process to be done.  Henry Stopplecamp confirmed that was the case.

Director Francone wondered if RTD typically spent the $1 million budgeted for maintenance of the 16th Street Mall.  Henry Stopplecamp replied in the affirmative, adding that it has been above the budgeted amount in recent years.

Director Francone asked what would happen if the alternative materials process moved at a speedy pace rendering Gallegos’ service not necessary.  Henry Stopplecamp replied that Gallegos is paid for work performed.  He added that in the event of changing the transitway, there would still have to be a contract awarded to pull out the pavers.  Whenever that happens, staff would recommend going back to Denver to agree on next steps.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution which adopts the Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.

Motion:                Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development, reminded the Directors that staff presented the recommended changes to the policy in June.  Staff offered to meet one-on-one with the Directors to discuss any comments and/or concerns in August, and presented a draft to the Board in November.  She noted that there were no comments on this particular policy.  She added that most of the changes from the draft to the final document are clarifications and language clean ups.

Director Bagley said that he has carefully read both this policy and the Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property Policy.  He noted that he spent about 40 minutes with Kate Iverson on the phone about two weeks ago discussing the documents.  He believes that both of these documents deserve Board approval.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.

#### 3. Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution

Motion:                Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 15, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Kate Iverson, Manager for Transit Oriented Development, shared that the main concerns with this policy throughout the revision process had to do with notice and transparency.  The final version of the policy removes the sole source criteria.  Staff would still work with adjacent property owners first when dealing with small pieces of property that are not needed.  When an unsolicited proposal is received, staff will evaluate the agency’s need and the proposal’s technical merit.  If the proposal measures well in these two areas, then staff would move forward with the competitive process.

Director Bagley noted that there are a few current projects, such as the Alameda Station and the University of Denver Station Senior Housing, that are examples of this policy.  He reminded the Directors that price is not the only factor when evaluating these types of projects.  He noted that the relationship with the community is critical as the community may benefit from certains developments, such as affordable housing and other issues pertinent to the area.

Director Folska highlighted the importance of streamlining processes and procedures to attract viable developers and build new streams of revenue.  She added that finding the balance of what is great for developers and what is in the best interest of RTD is a tough job.  She praised staff for their work on this policy.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their openness to comments and making the document stress the competitiveness and transparency.

Chair Sisk thanked staff for their work on the policy.  He expressed his satisfaction with the elimination of sole source from the document.  He reiterated the importance of transparency for the agency.  He noted that in the past he has been on the fence about this policy but now he is in favor.

Director James mentioned that he is happy to see both of these policies approved.  He thanked staff and the Directors for taking the time to work throughout this process.  He expects that these policies would allow RTD to be perceived as a dependable agency to work with.

Director Anderson pointed out that she supports the hard work that has gone into working on this policy.  She added that she is in favor of the more explicit open process.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.
