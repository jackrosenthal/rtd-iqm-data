II.

MyStop Update – Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager, Public Affairs gave this
report. Each bus stop sign in the district has a number on it. Customers can call the
RTD customer service number and then press the 1 button to access the MyStop
program. By entering the code on the bus stop sign, the customer will be told what
time the next three buses are scheduled for. The system is available 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. New myStop signs will be in place throughout the whole district
by January of 2010.
Joe Berdaus, Senior Manager of Customer Service said that the MyStop program has
been in operation since July 1, 2009. With a very small amount of marketing, we
have reached 1800 calls per day.
Director Cohen asked about the average call time before myStop and Scott Reed said
it was an average time of 75 seconds. We are currently at 51 seconds with myStop
but it will take awhile to see what the full impact will be.
Director James tested myStop himself and said he wanted it stressed that it is
scheduled time not actual time.
Director McMullen said that he tried the system and it worked well except the bus
was late. Gary Googins shared the real time information is coming but it will be in a
few years once the new CAD/AVL system is in place.
Gary Googins shared that Spanish will be added to the myStop system next month.

III.

Access-a-Ride Radio Replacement – Bruce Abel introduced this item. RTD is in the
midst of a project to update the CAD/AVL and radio system as part of the FCC
changes in radio requirements. The project is scheduled to be completed by January
1, 2013. As the District has progressed through this project, the radio system for
access-a-Ride has been reviewed as it is not currently integrated with the CAD/AVL
program. Staff did a business case analysis and has concluded that the access-aRide radio program will be rolled into the CAD/AVL system. The District has been
able to obtain some grants to help with the funding of this project.
Director Daly would like to see a demonstration of the AVL/MDTs. Bruce Abel said
this could be arranged.
Director McMullen asked about radio coverage. Eric Farrington explained with the
current system there are some gaps but with the new system, we expect to have
95% over the entire service area with the gaps being in Boulder Canyon and in
between Evergreen and Conifer.
Director Christopher was concerned about the funding as some of it was coming
from the vehicle replacement fund. Bruce Abel explained that with RTD receiving
Senate Bill 1 grant money for the expansion vehicle funding it allowed us to use RTD
money for this program without compromising the vehicle replacement program.

Director Tobiassen asked how the current spotty coverage was going to improve and
also how we can measure that this will really contribute to improving the access-aRide service.
Eric Farrington said that in terms of the coverage, the district is moving into the 700
mega hertz public safety spectrum and co-locate towers with existing public safety
organizations, Boulder, Arapahoe County, and the State. The District has done some
drive testing for the coverage and from those three towers; the coverage is greater
than 95%. The District is in discussion with the owners of the towers and they are
receptive to the District co-locating on their towers.
Bruce Abel said that currently cell phones are deployed on vehicles that are in the
outlying areas so that radios will increase the reliability of communications system
wide.
IV.

Update of Deployment on AVL/MDT Technology on access-a-Ride – Sixty vehicles
left to go to complete the installation of the AVL/MDTs. Staff is anticipating rollout
within the next seven to ten days and then reviewing the will call process and
coming up with a recommendation by September 2009.

V.

Timeline for January 2010 Service Changes – Bruce Abel referenced the handout in
the packet. Next month the recommendation to take the service changes to public
hearing will come to the committee.
Director Martinez wanted to know what the scale will be of the service changes.
Bruce Abel responded that it depends on the strategies the board takes to mitigate
the budget shortfall.

VI.

Next Meeting Date – The next meeting of the Operations and Customer Services
Committee will be September 8, 2009.

VII.

Other Matters – There were no other matters discussed.

VIII.
