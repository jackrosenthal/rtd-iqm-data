BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Operations, Safety, and Security Committee Work
Plan

February 6, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
JoyAnn Ruscha, Committee Chair
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
Article VI, Section 4 of the Board Bylaws details the purpose of and process for approving committee
work plans as follows:
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for
review an annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the
fiscal year. The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s
chair, vice chair, and the responsible RTD staff with the input of the committee’s members. The
work plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year.
Work plans for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing
committee’s work, extend through February of the following fiscal year. Adjustments and
additions to the work plan can be made by the committee chair in consultation with the
committee vice chair and responsible RTD staff.
Additionally, per Article VI, Section 1, e.), the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee is
“responsible for all operational matters, including all contracted and non-contracted bus, rail, paratransit,
and microtransit services, as well as safety and security matters.”
DISCUSSION
The committee is asked to continue its review of the attached draft work plan and provide additional
input on the draft document including suggesting items not listed, removing items listed, or adjusting the
timing of the items listed. The Committee previously discussed this item at its meeting on January 15,
2025.
Following the discussion at the committee meeting on January 15, 2025, senior staff met with the chair
and vice chair of the committee to further refine the work plan. Additional discussions ensued during the
2025 Board Retreat, which was held February 1, 2025. The committee will further discuss the workplan
at the February 6, 2025 committee meeting, and the work plan will return to the committee for potential
approval at the February 12, 2025 committee meeting.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the discussion regarding the Committee’s work plan.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee’s ability to
effectively govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan
will ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives
are more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
