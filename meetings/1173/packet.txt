Approval of the Downtown Denver Circulator
Fare-Free Service Plan

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
Downtown Denver Circulator bus service plan including fare-free operations beginning in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan included funding for a Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator)
bus transit project to complement and enhance the existing 16th Street FREE MallRide. The Circulator is
a critical element to the implementation of the FasTracks Plan as the MallRide will not be able to
accommodate the increase in passengers from the addition of the US 36 BRT and the West, East, Gold,
North Metro, and Northwest Rail Lines.
Since the adoption of the original FasTracks Plan in 2004, RTD has worked with the City and County of
Denver to refine the plan for the Circulator. The long-range vision for the Circulator is all-day operations
along 18th and 19th Streets and Broadway and Lincoln Street between Denver Union Station (DUS) and
the Denver Art Museum area south of Colfax Avenue. The service is planned to operate in mixed-flow
traffic with transit priority measures such as bus bulbs, dedicated stops, a bus/bike/HOV lane, and
multiple-door, fare-free boarding.
In the short-term, RTD is recommending that the Circulator operate during the weekday peak periods
only with five minute headway based service between DUS and Civic Center. The peak period
operations are necessary to prevent overcrowding of the MallRide with the opening of DUS. The
MallRide will continue to have adequate capacity to accommodate the normal mid-day and weekend
transit ridership demand. The Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide and service levels can be
increased when the MallRide is expected to be overcrowded, including for special events. Therefore, it
is necessary for the Circulator to also offer free service in order to attract customers from the
overcrowded MallRide.
DISCUSSION
Fare-free service is recommended for the Circulator due to a number of characteristics unique to the
Circulator.
These characteristics are outlined below and were the basis for the fare-free
recommendation.
1. The Circulator is a regional service that provides a benefit for the entire District. A recent passenger
survey on the MallRide indicated that 40% of the passengers are from outside of the City of Denver.
The Circulator is anticipated to have a similar or greater percentage of non-Denver residents due to
the primary function being the last mile connection for commuters arriving downtown from other
RTD services that serve the entire District.
2. The Circulator will provide the last mile connection from the new FasTracks projects to the major
employment center in the region. The Circulator and MallRide are necessary for the design of a

Packet Pg. 4

2.12.B

major transit hub at the edge of downtown to work. The service needs to be fast and convenient for
passengers to transfer modes for the last mile of their trip.
3. There is a parallel free service with the MallRide two blocks away serving the same travel pattern.
Since the Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide, any passengers who would have to pay
the fare would likely opt to not pay a fare and instead take the MallRide.
4. The Circulator ridership is anticipated to be over 80% transfers to or from other RTD services. RTD
has a free transfer policy so the majority of riders would not have to pay a fare even if it was not a
free service. As such, the cost of charging a fare would far exceed the fare revenue collected.
In addition to the characteristics outlined above, the operations of the Circulator would make it difficult
to collect a fare. Multiple-door, fare-free boarding is considered the most important transit priority
measure for the Circulator as it has the greatest impact on reducing travel times and increasing the
reliability of the service. Charging a fare and allowing multiple-door boarding would require off-board
fare collection or a policy that all passengers needing to pay a fare would have to board at the front
door. These options would be very difficult and costly to enforce. If the Circulator cannot operate with
multiple-door boarding, it would not be any different than a standard RTD Local route and other
alternatives such as increasing service on existing downtown routes such as the 0 and 15L should be
considered.
A preliminary Title VI review of the service plan and fare policy reveals an equitable impact with respect
to race, color, national origin and income. The analysis will be completed and submitted to the FTA six
months in advance of the Circulator’s commencement of operation. Once the FTA provides feedback on
the completed equity analysis, the Planning Department will finalize the analysis and seek RTD Board
approval (as required per FTA Guidance).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The opening day Circulator service plan is anticipated to cost $830,000 per year for operations and
maintenance (O&M). This is based on peak period service, six hours per weekday, between DUS and
Civic Center and fare-free operations. The O&M for the Circulator will be paid for from FasTracks.
Charging a fare would result in an increase in the O&M required to operate the Circulator and an increase
in annual Circulator O&M would have a negative impact on the rest of the FasTracks Program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the Circulator service plan including fare-free operations beginning in
2014.
2. Approve the opening of the Circulator as a fare service in 2014. This is not recommended for the
reasons outlined in the Discussion section and would negatively impact the FasTracks financial plan.
In addition, this option could require additional capital investments for fare equipment that are not
included in the Circulator project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the Circulator service plan to begin in
2014. This is not recommended as the Circulator is a commitment in the FasTracks plan and a
necessary element to ensure the success of the other projects. Without the Circulator, the MallRide
will be overcrowded which would require RTD to increase service levels on existing downtown routes
such as the 0 and 15L. The Base System is not able to absorb the increased O&M costs associated
with this alternative. In addition, this alternative would require additional buses for these routes

Packet Pg. 5

2.12.B

which have not been programed. The Circulator project was awarded a $3.9 Million FASTER grant
for purchasing buses and this money would be lost if the Circulator is not implemented.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

May 16, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2013

Subject:

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy mandated by the Federal Transit Administration of the
United States Department of Transportation.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the current policy on October 25, 2011. Recently there have been
changes in the federal regulation guidance on recreational and medical marijuana and Collective
Bargaining Agreement. RTD is therefore required to revise the policy, as negotiated with the ATU 1001,
and define provisions to comply with current US Department of Transportation and Federal Transit
Administration requirements. A revised copy is attached for your review with specific changes listed
below.
DISCUSSION
The policy changes are as follows:
Page 6
Updated Medical and Recreational Marijuana policy statement in accordance with
49CFR part 40.
Page 8
Removed 24-month provision for first and second violation for alcohol levels
between 0.02 but less than 0.04.
Pages 8 & 9 Removed 24-month provision for first and second verified positive test.
Page 11
Removed a list of initial and confirmatory cutoff levels replacing them with a single
sentence referring to 49CFR Part 40, as amended.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Removal of the 24-month provisions from the policy will decrease the number of repeat offenders. It will
decrease the financial strain on the District as multiple violations of Drug and Alcohol Policy create
intense and lengthy follow-up programs that require significant RTD resources. Savings to RTD are, at a
minimum, of $10,000 per occurrence.
By removing references to specific federal regulations and metabolite levels, fewer updates to all
covered employees will be required.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the Financial/Administration Committee recommend to the full RTD Board
of Directors that the revisions to the RTD Substance Abuse Policy be approved.
2. Do not approve the revised policy. This is not recommended, as this will result in the Agency
being non-compliant with the DOT and FTA regulations.

Regional Transportation District

Drug and Alcohol Policy

The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work environment
for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree that employees of the
system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every
effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all employees. The employer has the
right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the public from the adverse effects of drug and
alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug
testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective
employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights and
privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy to (1)
detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing; (2) encourage employees to obtain
treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems; (3) deter drug or alcohol use in violation of
this policy through education, training, and discipline; and (4) enforce RTD's goal of a drug- and alcoholfree work environment through appropriate discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be aware
of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected. Appendix A to this policy contains additional discussion of these
matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 15, 1998, July 18,
2000, May 20, 2003 and July 2011. Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations
covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this policy are not required by
federal regulations but are official RTD policy. Appendix B to this policy explains which elements of this
policy are not federally required. Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol
use may contact RTD's Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended or

revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be familiar with,
and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new RTD
employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited
drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and the signs and symptoms which may
indicate prohibited drug use.

2.0 Applicability
2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and vendors are expected to
adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safetysensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended
and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in
this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to
perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of mass transit
services. The following are safety-sensitive functions:
1.

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in
revenue service.

2.

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.

3.

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.

4.

Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a
holder of a CDL.

5.

Carrying a firearm for security purposes.

6.

Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items 1-5
above.

RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job functions may
require the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job

2.2

Categories of Prohibited Substances

This policy applies to controlled substances (see section 2.2.1 of this policy); legal drugs or
medications which may impair mental functioning, motor skills or judgment (section 2.2.2); and alcohol
(section 2.2.3). For ease of reference, these substances are collectively referred to in this policy as
"prohibited substances" unless otherwise noted.

Controlled substances are any drug or other substance identified in Schedules I through V of the
federal Controlled Substance Act (21 USC section 801 et seq.), federal regulations at 21 CFR sections
1300.11 through 1300.15, and the Colorado Controlled Substance Act (CRS section 12-22-301), all as
amended. Controlled substances include, but are not necessarily limited to: marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and PCP (phencyclidine).
2.2.2 Legal Drugs or Medications
The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs or over-the-counter medications are not
prohibited. However, the use of any legally prescribed drug or medication which carries a warning label
that indicates that mental functions, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be
discussed by employees with their appropriate health care professional before performing work-related
duties. Employees are urged to seek and obtain medical confirmation prior to using prescription or over
the counter drugs to assure that such consumption will not adversely affect their ability to safely
perform essential job functions. Appendix C contains guidelines for use of prescribed drugs and over-thecounter medications and a partial list of some over-the-counter medications that may affect your ability
to drive.
A legally prescribed drug is one for which the employee has a prescription or other written
authorization from a licensed health care provider permitted by law to prescribe or dispense drugs or
medications. The authorization must include the employee's name, the name of the substance, the
amount to be taken, and the period of authorization.
2.2.3 Medical and Recreational Marijuana
Colorado law on the use of medical and recreational marijuana does not amend, exempt, or
supersede RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Policy. The Department of Transportation’s Drug and Alcohol Testing
Regulation 49CFR Part 40, section 40.151(e) does not authorize verification of a test based on
information that a physician recommended that the employee use a drug listed in Schedule I of the
Controlled Substances act. (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such recommendations,
such as the “medical marijuana” laws that some states have adopted). The MRO will not verify a drug
test as negative based upon learning that the employee used “medical or recreational marijuana” when
states have passed “medical or recreational marijuana” initiatives.

vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break
ends. Employees are subject to this policy on regularly scheduled days, and when volunteering for or
assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. Safety-sensitive employees are also subject to this
policy at additional times set forth in section 3.4 of this policy.

3.0 Prohibited Conduct; Discipline
Discipline under this policy is independent of discipline for violation of any other performance
code or work rules. For example, an employee who causes an accident and tests positive for alcohol use
may receive separate, consecutive penalties for both the accident and the positive test.
In addition to any disciplinary action taken under this policy, law enforcement authorities may be
notified where criminal activity is suspected in connection with any of the following prohibited conduct.

3.1

Possession/Use of Prohibited Substances at RTD

Any employee found to manufacture, distribute, dispense, sell, possess, or use prohibited
substances while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD
vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break
ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.2

Intoxication/Under Influence

Any employee reasonably suspected of being intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence
of a prohibited substance, or of being not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD
duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or
other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break ends, may be immediately
suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of his or her condition. Any
employee found to be intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence of a prohibited substance, or
not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is
scheduled to return to work when the break ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

Positive Drug or Alcohol Tests

Any time that an employee loses while removed from service pending report of a confirmatory
test (or for safety-sensitive employees, while removed from service under section 5.1 of this policy) will
be counted towards disciplinary suspension time.
3.3.1 Alcohol Test of 0.02 but Less than 0.04
Federal law requires RTD to remove a safety-sensitive employee from service as provided in
section 5.1 of this policy if a confirmatory breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02
or greater but less than 0.04. To deter such conduct, a safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory
breath alcohol test of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 may receive the following discipline:
1.

First violation: Removal from service for no less than eight hours or until the start of
the employee's next shift, whichever comes first; warning letter; and
recommendation that the employee seek assistance from the Employee Assistance
Program (“EAP”).
For a first violation when the employee has already been subject to the return-toduty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy, discipline may be a five-working-day
unpaid suspension (with time lost under section 5.1 counting toward the
suspension time) up to termination, depending on the circumstances.

2.

Second violation: Disciplined as a "verified positive" test as defined in section 4.1.2
of this policy (i.e., as a positive confirmatory test for alcohol concentration of 0.04
or greater).
For a second violation when the employee has already been subject to the returnto-duty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy, the employee may be terminated.
3.3.2 Verified Positive Test

Any employee with a "verified positive" drug or alcohol test, as that term is defined in section 4.1 of
this policy (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater),
may receive the following discipline:
1.

First violation: 20-working-day unpaid suspension to termination, depending on
circumstances. If discipline is other than termination, the employee must also
undergo an employment assessment and fulfill return-to-duty requirements as set
forth in sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy.

Additional Prohibitions for Safety-Sensitive Employees

Any safety-sensitive employee who uses alcohol within four hours prior to duty, or during
otherwise specified on-call hours, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.5

Noncompliance with Testing Requirements

Any employee who refuses to comply with an RTD request for drug or alcohol testing, provides
false information in connection with a drug or alcohol test, or attempts to falsify drug or alcohol test
results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution of a test sample, may be treated
as if the employee had received a "verified positive" drug test result (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for
drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater), may be removed from service immediately, and
may be subject to discipline up to and including termination. In addition, noncompliance with testing
requirements may constitute a verified positive drug test result for purposes of section 5.1 of this policy
(removal of safety-sensitive employees from service).
"Refusal to comply” includes:
1. Failure to appear for any test (except pre-employment test) within a reasonable time
as determined by RTD.
2. Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process is completed, except a
pre-employment test.
3. Failure to attempt provide a sufficient amount of urine, breath or saliva specimen as
required by FTA or DOT regulations.
4. In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, failure to
permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen.
5. Failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when directed, and it has
been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no
adequate medical explanation for the failure.
6. Failure or decline to take an additional drug test RTD or the collector has directed
you to take.
7. Failure to undergo a medical evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the
verification process, or as directed by the Designated Employer Representative
(DER).
8. Failure to sign Step #2 of the ATF.
9. Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process.

the employee may be terminated.

2.12.C.a

For pre-employment only, failure to appear, aborting the collection before the test commences, or
failure to remain at the site prior to commencement of test is NOT a test refusal.
A refusal to test constitutes violation of this policy and will be treated the same as a positive test
result. Refusal to test under RTD authority will not be considered as a refusal to take a DOT-required
test.

3.6

Criminal Convictions

Any employee who is convicted of a felony involving off-site purchase, sale or distribution of a
controlled substance, or who fails to immediately notify his or her supervisor of any such conviction,
may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.7

Noncompliance with Treatment Requirements

Under certain circumstances, federal law requires RTD to impose and monitor treatment of RTD
employees for substance abuse, and to set aftercare and return-to-duty requirements (see sections 5.3
and 5.4 of this policy). Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with RTD requirements for
substance abuse treatment, aftercare, or return to duty may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

The Union and RTD will cooperate to allow the Union reasonable opportunity to review the Drug
and Alcohol program subject to limits of confidentiality. Such review may include, but is not limited to,
credentials of the medical review officer, Substance Abuse Professionals, breath alcohol technicians, and
testing laboratories.
In addition, RTD will permit the Union reasonable opportunity to review the results of blind testing
conducted on an unannounced basis to maintain the integrity of the testing facility. The Union shall
receive, when reasonably requested and subject to confidentiality, information including, but not limited
to, drug test results, chain of custody forms, the random selection process, and collection site
procedures. RTD and the Union may jointly review literature and research on alcohol and drug testing
technology and procedures, suggested changes and improvements to the program, and employee
education and training programs.
RTD will strictly adhere to all standards of confidentiality. Testing records and results will be
released only to those authorized by federal regulations to receive such information. RTD will strive to
protect employees' rights to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process.
4.1.1 Drug Testing Procedures
RTD will designate a medical review officer (“MRO”) to receive drug test results and evaluate,
interpret and verify the results in conjunction with an employee's medical history, to determine whether
a positive drug test result was caused by the use of controlled substances or by an employee's medical
condition. The MRO will then report all test results to the RTD via electronic file. The MRO shall be a
licensed physician (doctor of medicine or osteopathy) with knowledge of drug abuse disorders. In
carrying out his or her responsibilities, the MRO shall examine alternate medical explanations for any
positive test result. This action may include conducting a medical interview and review of the
individual’s medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical factors. The MRO shall review all
medical records made available by the tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have
resulted from legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall not, however, consider the results of urine
samples that are not obtained or processed in accordance with 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.
Pursuant to federal regulations, drugs to be tested for are marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). (RTD reserves the right, not based on federal regulations, to
test for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Librium, Xanax),
nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g., Quaalude), and nonamphetamine stimulants, by separate urine specimen
if there is reasonable suspicion of such drug use (see section 4.2.2 of this policy).
An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen at a laboratory certified by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). For specimens that are not negative (at or

Employees may be required to submit to urine drug testing and/or breath alcohol testing under
circumstances set forth in this policy. Testing shall be conducted in a manner to protect the rights of the
employee, assure the integrity of the drug testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and
ensure that test results are attributed to the correct employee. Collectors will use techniques, equipment
and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the federal government. All testing will be
conducted consistent with federal requirements of 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended and Part 655.

2.12.C.a

Before verifying that an employee has a positive test result, the MRO is responsible for contacting
any such employee, on a direct and confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wishes to
discuss the test or present a legitimate explanation for the positive result. An MRO staff person may
make the contact; the MRO’s medically licensed or certified staff person may gather information. If,
after reasonable efforts, the MRO is unable to reach the employee directly, the MRO may contact RTD’s
designated management official for assistance in contacting the employee. RTD’s designated
management official will take maximum precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the MRO contact.
If, after making all diligent and reasonable efforts, neither the MRO nor RTD’s designated
management official are able to contact the employee within ten (10) days of the date the MRO received
the confirmed positive test result from the laboratory, the MRO may verify the test result as positive.
The MRO may also verify the test result as positive if RTD’s designated management official has
successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact
the MRO and 72 hours have passed since the time RTD’s designated management official contacted the
employee. The MRO may reopen the verification of positive test if the employee presents documentation
of serious injury or illness or other circumstances which unavoidably prevented the employee from being
contacted within the designated time period, and if the employee then presents a legitimate (in the
MRO’s opinion) explanation for the positive test, the MRO shall declare the test to be negative.
The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive test that the employee has 72
hours in which to request a test of a split specimen provided at the same time as the original sample. If
the employee requests an analysis of the split specimen within 72 hours of having been informed of a
verified positive test, the MRO shall direct, in writing, the laboratory to provide the split specimen to
another DHHS-certified testing laboratory for analysis. All costs for such testing shall be paid by the
employee (by payroll deduction if necessary) unless the additional test invalidates the confirmatory test.
The methods of collecting, storing and testing the split sample will be consistent with 49 CFR Part 40. If
analysis of the split specimen fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug(s) or metabolite(s) found in the
primary specimen, or if the split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing, or untestable, the MRO
shall cancel the test and report cancellation and the reasons for it to the DOT, RTD and the employee.
Federally-mandated urine and breath forms must be used for all federally-mandated testing.
Specimens shall be collected and identified as required by 49 CFR. Specimens and written records shall
be stored by the laboratory, MRO and RTD as required by 49 CFR Part 40. Among other requirements,
all records pertaining to a given urine specimen shall be retained by the drug testing laboratory for a
minimum of 2 years, and all specimens confirmed positive shall be kept in their original labeled specimen
bottles and placed in properly secured long-term frozen storage for a minimum of 1 year. The laboratory
shall be required to maintain any specimens known to be under legal challenge for an indefinite period.
RTD’s contracts with laboratories shall require that the laboratory maintain employee test records in
confidence, as provided in DOT agency regulations; and that the laboratory shall disclose information

Department of Transportation (DOT) requires employees to submit to an observed collection
under the following conditions:
1. Return-to-duty tests.
2. Follow-up tests.
3. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the
temperature on the original specimen was out of the accepted temperature range.
4. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the original
specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
5. Anytime a collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the
employee’s conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen.
6. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the
laboratory reported to the MRO that the original specimen was invalid and the MRO
determined that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result.
7. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the MRO
determined that the original specimen was positive, adulterated or substituted, but
had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed.
4.1.4 Alcohol Testing Procedures
Alcohol testing will be performed by a qualified Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) or Screening
Test Technician (STT). The BAT or STT must receive qualification training meeting the requirements in
49 CFR Part 40 as amended. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a
second, confirmatory, test will be performed. If the confirmatory test indicates an alcohol concentration
of 0.04 or greater, the confirming test will be considered a "verified positive" test under this policy.

Categories of Tests
4.2.1 Pre-Employment Drug Testing

All applicants for employment will be tested for drug use prior to employment in any position at
RTD, and prior to transfer from a non-safety-sensitive position into a safety-sensitive position. Receipt by
RTD of a verified negative drug result is required prior to employment or transfer. A verified positive test
(i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use) will disqualify an applicant from again applying for
employment or transfer for 24 months from date of collection; in addition, the applicant will receive a

4.2.2 Reasonable Suspicion Testing
An employee will be tested where there is reasonable suspicion that the employee has engaged in
drug or alcohol use. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing for safety-sensitive employees shall be
performed just before, during and just following the performance of a safety-sensitive function. To come
under reasonable suspicion, the employee must be observed by a supervisor trained in the detection of
drug or alcohol misuse. Supervisors who make reasonable suspicion determinations of drug use shall
receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of
probable drug use. Supervisors designated to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists for alcohol
testing shall receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech and performance
indicators of probable alcohol misuse. Reasonable suspicion testing is required when (1) one trained
supervisor can (2) articulate and substantiate physical, behavioral and performance indicators of probable
drug use or alcohol misuse by (3) observing the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the
employee. Examples of conditions which may result in reasonable-suspicion testing include, but are not
limited to, the following:
1.

Physical signs and symptoms consistent with use of prohibited substances.

2.

Evidence of manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of prohibited
substances.

3.

Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have been caused
by human error, including but not necessarily limited to any accident in which the
RTD Accident Investigation Team (AIT) is summoned.

4.

The employee is involved in an accident in which, at the reasonable discretion of
the supervisor, negligence, carelessness or poor judgment may have been involved.

5.

Fights involving physical contact, assaults, and flagrant disregard or violation of
established safety, security, or other operating procedures.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Safety-sensitive employees who have been off duty for 90 days or more for any reason, and have been
out of the random pool, must successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the performance of
a safety-sensitive function.

2.12.C.a

In case of a non-fatal accident in which either (1) an individual sustains injuries requiring
immediate treatment at a medical treatment facility, (2) the RTD vehicle is a bus, van or automobile and
one or more vehicles incur disabling damage that requires towing from the site, or (3) the RTD vehicle is
a vehicle operating on rails and is removed from revenue service, tests will be conducted on all
employees on duty in the RTD vehicle (unless the employee's behavior can be completely discounted as
a contributing factor to the accident) and on any other employee whose performance could have
contributed to the accident.
The above post-accident testing procedures are separate from reasonable-suspicion testing
conducted under section 4.2.2 of this policy.
Post-accident testing will be done as soon as possible, and no later than eight hours after the
accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours after the accident for drug testing. An employee involved in an
accident must not use alcohol until after the employee undergoes alcohol testing or eight hours have
elapsed, whichever comes first. Every effort will be made to conduct alcohol testing within two hours
after the accident. In the event the alcohol test is delayed beyond two hours, RTD will prepare and
maintain a record stating the reason(s) for the delay. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight
hours following the accident, all attempts to administer the test must cease and RTD must update the
record.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for
the injured following an accident or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the
period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency
medical care. However, any employee who under the above circumstances fails to remain readily
available for drug and alcohol testing (including notifying RTD of his or her location), or who otherwise
leaves the scene of an accident without appropriate authorization prior to submission to drug and alcohol
testing, will be considered to have refused the test. Under section 3.5 of this policy, leaving the scene
of an accident without valid reason is a serious violation subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

4.2.4 Return-to-Duty Testing
As part of the employment assessment and return-to-duty requirements set forth in sections 5.3
and 5.4 of this policy, any employee with a verified positive drug or alcohol test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) must test negative for drugs
and alcohol before returning to work, and will be subject to follow-up random drug and alcohol testing
after returning to work.

vehicle and on any other employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident.

2.12.C.a

Employees in safety-sensitive positions will be subjected to unannounced random drug and
alcohol testing in accordance with FTA regulation 655.45. Random selections shall be a sufficient
number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than
the minimum annual percentage rate of 10% of the safety-sensitive workforce for alcohol and 25% for
drugs or at the rates set forth by the FTA in Part 655, as amended. Each such employee shall be in a
pool from which random selection is made. Each such employee shall have an equal chance at selection
and shall remain in the pool even after being tested. The basis for random selection shall be by a
scientifically valid random number generation method initiated by computer. To ensure that employees
have a reasonable expectation that they might be called for a test on any day they are at work, the
dates for random testing shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random tests are
unannounced and immediate. Employees are required to proceed to the test site immediately upon
notification. Random testing may also be conducted pursuant to other sections of this policy. A safetysensitive employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse just before, during and just following
the performance of a safety-sensitive function. In addition, RTD senior staff will be expected to
participate in random testing (testing of non-safety-sensitive senior staff is based on RTD’s independent
authority and not federal regulations).

4.3

Employee Status Pending Test Results

Employees who are tested for reasonable suspicion or post accident testing will be immediately
removed from service without pay and will not be allowed to return to work until test results are
reported.
If a negative test result is reported, either from an initial test or a confirmatory test, the employee
will be notified immediately, returned to work, and compensated for the period of absence from work.
As a general rule, when an employee is sent for a random test, the employee will not be removed
from service pending receipt of test results.

5.0 Consequences of Positive Tests
5.1

Special Consequences for Safety-Sensitive Employees

A safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory alcohol test result of 0.02 or greater, but less
than 0.04, shall be immediately removed from service for a minimum of eight hours, or until re-tested
below 0.02 or until the employee's next shift. A safety-sensitive employee with a verified positive test
(i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) shall be
immediately removed from service until after an employment assessment and release to return to duty
by a Substance Abuse Professional (“SAP”) under section 5.3 of this policy.

Discipline for a positive drug or alcohol test is set forth in paragraph 3.3 above.

Employment Assessment

Any employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or
alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) will be immediately removed from duty and must be promptly
assessed by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An SAP is either (1) a licensed physician, or a
licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional with knowledge of
and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-and drug-related disorders; or (2) an
addiction counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors
Certification Commission. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any,
the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited substance abuse or misuse.
Assessment by an SAP does not exempt an employee from discipline, and does not guarantee
continued employment or reinstatement. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid
by the employee or the employee's own insurance provider.
If the SAP releases the employee to return to duty, the employee must promptly follow the
rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP, must pass a directly observed return-to-duty drug and
alcohol test (non-observed return-to-duty for positive/refusal results that were collected under RTD
authority), and must fulfill the return-to-duty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy.

5.4

Return-to-Duty Requirements

Employees who re-enter the workforce following (1) completion of a disciplinary suspension for a
verified positive drug or alcohol test, (2) a favorable employment assessment, and (3) successful returnto-duty testing, shall be subject to the following requirements:
1.

Unannounced observed follow-up drug and alcohol testing for one to five years
depending on the circumstances of the case and as recommended by the SAP.
Safety-sensitive employees must pass a minimum of six follow-up tests within the
first 12 months back in safety-sensitive duties.

2.

An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements recommended by the
SAP, with the cost of such requirements to be borne by the employee or the
employee's own insurance provider.

3.

Compliance with all recommendations of the SAP, and release to RTD from each
treatment provider of records of attendance, recommendations, and compliance.

An employee's violation of the above requirements may be grounds for termination under section

6.0 Employees Who Seek Assistance Prior to Violations

Employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency prior to violation of this policy
will be referred to the Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) for appropriate treatment and/or rehabilitation
program. Employees will not be subject to discipline for their participation in such programs. Employees
participating in or completing a treatment or rehabilitation program will continue to be required to comply
with RTD performance standards, policies, and rules and regulations, including but not limited to this
policy, and may be subject to discipline if these are violated.
If determined necessary by RTD-approved medical professionals, medical leaves of absence may
be arranged to allow for proper treatment of employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug
dependency, and RTD may make other reasonable accommodations pursuant to federal law.
RTD offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which is confidential, voluntary, free of
charge, and independent of RTD. EAP counselors can provide drug or alcohol treatment and/or
rehabilitation programs. Employees can call the EAP office directly and confidentially at 1-800-284-1819
to obtain additional information and to make an appointment. Alternatively, RTD encourages employees

with qualified Substance Abuse Professionals of their choice.
Upon successful completion of a treatment or rehabilitation program for drug or alcohol
dependency under this section, the employee must pass a non observed return-to-duty drug and alcohol
test and the employee will be subject to non observed random follow-up testing for a period of one year
to five years with a minimum of six times in the first year. An employee who fails to comply with non
observed random follow-up testing may be subject to discipline under section 3.5 of this policy.

APPENDIX A
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

The attached materials contain discussion of the effects of drug and alcohol abuse on the health,
work, and personal life not only of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at
large. The materials also discuss the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol problems, and possible
methods of intervening.

NOTE: RTD provides its employees a confidential Employee Assistance Program
(EAP) which provides employees and their immediate families a broad range of
confidential counseling and referral services for personal and job-related problems,
including drug or alcohol abuse. The program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. The EAP provides up to eight sessions of counseling for a problem and, if
warranted, refers the employee or family member to another agency or helping facility.
The employee is responsible for charges after a referral is made; however, the EAP can
often find an agency whose services are free or covered by insurance. Sick leave may
be used to visit EAP counselors during regular business hours.

Drugs and Alcohol: Effects, Signs, and Solutions

Contrary to popular belief, relatively few drug or alcohol abusers are on "skid row." For example,
only three percent of alcoholics are destitute; most hold jobs and have families.
Drugs and alcohol affect their users' judgment, performance and safety-awareness, which in turn
directly affects the safety and well-being of the users' families, all other employees, and the public at
large.

Effects of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Drug and alcohol abuse affect a person physically and mentally. These effects occur not only
during actual intoxication (which can last from almost immediately in the case of alcohol, to one to 24
hours after intake for other drugs), but also during residual hangovers, fatigue rebounds, and longer
periods of mental impairment. Physical and mental effects may include:

Poor coordination
Fatigue
Delayed decision-making
Poor or erratic judgment
Confusion
Learning difficulties
Poor memory
Loss of concentration
Depression or anxiety
Difficulty in sorting out priority tasks
Neurotic or psychotic behavior
Refusal to accept authority

Drugs and alcohol can also lead to many serious physical problems. For example, cocaine use even in small amounts, or by first-time users -- has been linked with heart attacks. Amphetamine abuse
can lead to strokes. Alcoholism can cause fatal cirrhosis of the liver. Use of heroin and other
intravenously-injected drugs expose the user to transmission of AIDS.
Some persons wrongly believe that marijuana is relatively "safe." However, in addition to
marijuana's links to many of the above physical and mental disturbances, research indicates that
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

Packet Pg. 30

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

One of every ten U.S. workers abuses alcohol or drugs. In fact, some studies conclude that up to
20-25 percent of the nation's workforce may be abusing alcohol or drugs. Experts estimate that there
are 10 million alcoholics in this country, 6 million current cocaine abusers, 16 to 20 million people who
frequently use marijuana, and several million persons who abuse prescription drugs.

2.12.C.a

marijuana is a "gateway" drug leading to further drug use. Almost 60 percent of marijuana users will go
on to use other drugs.
RTD's mission to provide safe and efficient mass transit is directly threatened by employees' drug
and alcohol abuse. For example, each year approximately two million motor vehicle collisions occur that
involve drinking and driving, injuring 700,000 persons and killing 25,000 persons. One of every two
Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related traffic accident in his or her lifetime.

The first signs of drug or alcohol abuse may be hard to distinguish from signs of other problems
such as job stress, overwork, fatigue, or emotional problems. To make recognition even more difficult,
drug- and alcohol-abusing employees often develop survival skills to avoid detection. Supervisors and
co-workers need to be aware of the following general signs of drug and alcohol abuse:


Absenteeism or tardiness. Employees with substance abuse problems may be absent an average of
two to three times more than the normal employee. They may exhibit a pattern of absences on
certain days, such as Mondays and Fridays.



Staff turnover. Chemically dependent people have disorganized lives. Many quit rather than face
detection; others transfer or are fired for poor or unsafe performance.



Equipment breakdown. Substance-abusing employees often lose interest in maintenance of
equipment and may use broken equipment as a way to avoid work.



Erratic performance; poor work quality. Mental and physical agility and concentration deteriorate
with substance abuse. The abuser may miss deadlines, have poor concentration, work in bursts of
energy, and overlook important details. The person becomes unreliable.



Poor morale. Substance abuse creates wide mood swings, anxiety depression, and anger. Coworkers often see substance abusers as poor "team workers" and safety hazards. Abusers often
blame work problems on someone or something else.



Increased accidents and "near-misses." Impaired employees are 3.6 times more likely to cause an
accident. Even small quantities of drugs or alcohol in the system can cause deterioration of
alertness, clear-mindedness, and reaction speed. For example, studies show that a person's driving
ability substantially decreases at a blood alcohol content level of .04%. This is the equivalent of
approximately two beers or one martini consumed in one hour.



Theft. Drugs are expensive, and drug users need lots of money to support their habits. As
substance abusers' value systems and judgment are affected by drugs, their loyalty and dedication to
their co-workers and employers is weakened.
The following signs may also indicate involvement of drugs or alcohol in a person's problems:



Sudden changes, usually for the worse, in attitude, work performance, or behavior

Note that each symptom, by itself, may point to problems other than drug or alcohol abuse.
However, when a pattern begins to develop, a supervisor, manager, co-worker or family member needs
to be alert and act quickly. Fueled by drug or alcohol abuse, these behaviors can quickly lead to
accidents, productivity problems, higher operating costs, greater absenteeism, and worsened service to
the public.

Solutions for Drug and Alcohol Abuse
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome in trying to help or reach the drug or alcohol abuser is
denial. To overcome a drug or alcohol dependency, a person must first and foremost be able and willing
to recognize the problem. However, some abusers, especially cocaine users, erroneously believe that
the drug actually improves their performance. Others insist that they can "control" their addictions on
their own. Denial must be confronted and overcome before the abuser can begin to recover.
Supervisors and co-workers endanger the lives and safety of the abuser, and his or her family, coworkers and the public, if they try to "cover up" for the abusing employee or do the employee's work.
Co-workers and supervisors should not allow a suspected substance abuser to continue working
at a lower level, and should not let friendship with the employee or fear of exposing an "embarrassing"
problem lead them into concealing the problem. They should not share in the abuser's denial by
encouraging the abuser to believe that he or she doesn't have a problem.
Co-workers and supervisors should pay attention to the warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse,
talk to the abuser about concerns you have for the abuser's health or job, and refuse to cover up for or
take excuses from the abuser.
Supervisors should also know how to administer and apply RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy and
other performance rules and policies.

2.12.C.a

Co-workers and supervisors should encourage a suspected abuser of drugs or alcohol to seek
assistance from RTD's Employee Assistance Program. The abuser should be reminded that any help
offered through the EAP program is strictly confidential. Such EAP programs have 70-80 percent
success rates for substance abuse recovery. This is higher than rates for other programs, because with
EAP programs the employee has the commitment of the company behind him or her.
A person dependent on drugs or alcohol can also be referred to his or her personal health care
provider or clergy member, to private alcohol or drug treatment clinics, or to self-help groups such as
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.
Additional information on drug and alcohol use and abuse can be obtained from the Employee Assistance
Program or RTD's Department of Administration.

Successful intervention in the workplace often starts with a frank, firm, but sensitive discussion
with the person, focusing on problems with the person's performance or safety. To deal with the
person's likely denials, problems should be clearly documented so that the person can be shown clearcut evidence of what is wrong.

2.12.C.a

APPENDIX B
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Many elements of RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy are required by federal regulations covering
transit employees in safety-sensitive positions. Other elements of RTD's policy are not required by
federal regulations but are official RTD policy. Federal regulations require RTD to identify which
provisions of its policy are mandated by the regulations and which are not.
The parts of the Regional Transportation District Drug and Alcohol Policy not mandated by federal
regulations are as follows:
1.

RTD’s Policy applies to more than safety-sensitive employees covered by federal regulations. It
applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers, and
contractors. Visitors and vendors are also expected to adhere to the Policy while on RTD
property. (See Policy section 2.1.)

2.

RTD’s Policy contains hours of compliance beyond those required by federal regulations.
Specifically, employees are subject to the Policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, on lunch or other breaks if the employee is
scheduled to return to work when the break ends, on regularly scheduled days, and when
volunteering for or assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. (See Policy section 2.3.)

3.

Discipline is not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy sections 3.0 and 6.0.)

4.

Possession/use of prohibited substances, criminal convictions, noncompliance with treatment
requirements, improper use of policy, and alcoholic beverages on RTD property are not addressed
in the federal regulations. (See Policy sections 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.)

5.

The RTD-Union agreements for Union review of the Drug and Alcohol program and blind testing
results, and for joint review, are not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy section 4.1.)

6.

RTD has reserved the right, not based on federal regulations, to conduct reasonable-suspicion
testing by separate urine specimen for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines
(e.g. Valium, Librium, Xanax), nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g., Quaalude,), and nonamphetamine
stimulants. (See Policy section 4.1.1.).

7.

The following tests for non-safety-sensitive positions are not addressed in the federal regulations:
Pre-employment, Reasonable Suspicion, Post-Accident, Return-to-Duty, Follow-up and Senior
Staff Random testing. (See Policy section 4.2.)

Be Cautious. All medications, prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications
have the potential to be dangerous. Use medications cautiously and always in
accordance with your physician’s directions. Do not perform any safety-sensitive
function if you are impaired by any medication; however this caution should not be
construed to require any FTA covered employee to delay or deny any necessary medical
treatment.
Inform your prescribing physician, dentist or other medical professional. Before accepting
a prescription, inform you physician of your safety-sensitive position and explain your job
duties. Do not assume he/she will remember your explanation from one visit to the next.
Remind him/her of any other medications you might be taking; make sure to include those
medications prescribed by other physicians. Make sure the physician has your complete
medical history. Ask if you will be able to perform your duties safely on these
medications. If no, ask if there is an alternative.
Solicit information from you pharmacist. Anytime you need additional information about
an Rx or OTC, ask your pharmacist. A pharmacist will be very knowledgeable about the
medication ingredients, side-effects, precautions, drug interactions, and effects when
combined with other drugs. Even if you have already obtained information from your
prescribing physician, your pharmacist may be more knowledgeable and be able to
provide additional information and insight. Read warning labels and side-effects provided
on information summaries provided with Rx and OTC’s.
Do not over-medicate. Always follow the prescription directly as written. Never increase
the dosage or frequency of use without explicit directions from your doctor. Not only is
this practice medically risky, but increased dose of a medication may cause impairment
when the same medication used as recommended may not.
Check the strength of the prescription. Sometimes medicines are prescribed in different
strengths (i.e., 500 vs. 250 MG). Do not take a pill without first checking the dosage
and comparing it to the prescription, even it you have taken this medication before or this
is a refill.
Never take someone else’s medication. Even if you have taken this medication or one
like it before, this is illegal, dangerous, and it may cause impairment.
Always monitor your reaction. Anytime you take any medication (Rx or OTC) watch for
any side-effects which could impact your ability to perform your job safely including
drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, etc. Try to get accustomed to the medication first
before reporting for work. The same applies even if you have taken this medication in
the past with no previous side-effects. An individual’s reactions to a medication may
vary with each treatment, the nature of the illness and other medications taken.
Avoid Rx/OTCs that have been problems in the past. If you have taken medications in

the past that have caused negative side-effects, make a note of the active ingredients
and avoid these in the future. Inform your prescribing physician of your problem with the
previous medications and ask for alternative medications that do not have this ingredient.
For OTCs read the ingredient portion of the label and ask the pharmacist for assistance.
Ask for alternative treatments or dosage schedule. If you notice side-effects that could
pose a safety risk, consult your prescribing physician (or pharmacist in the case of an
OTC) about alternative treatments, medications, dosages, or schedule of use. You may
be able to avoid the negative side-effects by simply shifting the dosage schedule to take
your medications following your shift rather than before.
Do not perform safety sensitive duties while impaired. In instances where no alternative
prescription is available, you must inform your supervisor that you cannot perform any
safety sensitive duty while you are impaired by such medication.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 16, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2013

Subject:

August 2013 Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
moving the proposed August 2013 Service Change as summarized below and described in Attachment A
on to public review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. For this year we will continue adjusting
services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a
whole while also focusing attention on the recent implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service
and the associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the
West Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the
appropriate level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer
response to the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The proposed August 2013 Service Changes reflect the continued budgetary challenges faced by RTD.
The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance
service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Route 12 – Downing/N Washington
Add 3:20pm northbound trip from Downing/Colfax to 106th/Melody, relieving overloads on the
following trip. Cost impact estimated at $8,300 annualized.
Route 14 – West Florida
It is proposed to extend the weekday trip that (in April) starts at Wadsworth/West Arkansas at
6:39 a.m. to instead begin service at Lakewood Commons at 6:24 a.m. Estimated cost are
projected to be $2,600 annualized
Route 16 – West Colfax
Peak and midday overloads are occurring at a level which clearly exceeds RTD service
standards. These overloads occur on a regular basis on the link between Decatur-Federal
Station and the Civic Center. This segment carries a heavy burden of social services and court
traffic throughout the day, with space needed for disabled customers and strollers or walkers.
West between Decatur-Federal Station and Wadsworth, peak period overloads are occurring,
but more data is needed in order to place extra trips.
RTD will add shuttle trips as soon as possible (June 9, 2013) to lead every Route 16 trip
between Decatur-Federal and the 10th/Broadway route terminal on weekdays between the
hours of 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. This will not only add back capacity, but also improve W-Line
connections for Civic Center with matching headways, making the use of Light Rail more
practical for trips west of Federal.
Proposed for August runboard:
It is proposed to extend peak period extra service to the Zephyr Street terminal (Wadsworth
Blvd.) and to extend one additional AM trip from Golden to Oak Station and one additional PM
trip from Oak Station to Golden. Projected cost impacts for this proposal total $840,000 and 8
peak buses, including requirements for the Golden trip extensions.
Route 17 – Red Rocks College
With the extension to Indiana Street, the span of service that was appropriate for college hours
begins too late for most commuting purposes. It is proposed to add a round-trip from Federal
Center Station to Indiana Street on weekdays at 5:37 a.m. Estimated weekday cost $5,200
annualized weekday

Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Add 7:21am westbound trip from Centrepoint & Sable to Evans Station. Relieves overloads on
both the 7:06am and 7:36am westbound trips. Weekday cost impact estimated at $15,500

Running time analysis and schedule adjustments.
No cost impacts anticipated

Route 87X
The former Route 87 Express had three trips into CCS in the morning peak and three trips out
from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 128 boardings. The portion of the route west of
Wadsworth near Hampden was replaced by Route 30Ltd, which has twice as long a span of
service and a one-seat ride to the center of Downtown, as well as good transfer connections to
the Union Station and Civic Center. Although slower than Route 87X, that portion of the change
has received little criticism.
It is proposed to restore the route on its former alignment, with the exception of the segment
south of Yale Avenue, which was replaced by Route 30Ltd. That portion would be replaced by
running on Wadsworth to and from the Wadsworth & Hampden Park-n-Ride.
Requirements for restoring the route, based on the August 2012 Service Recap with interlines,
rounded up to 2 peak buses and $82,800 annualized.
Route 100 – Kipling Crosstown
A deviation from the current route on Quail Street is proposed to bring service closer to the new
Jefferson County Public Health location at 645 Parfet Street. Both northbound and southbound
buses would loop from Quail & Eighth via West Eighth Avenue, Parfet Street, West Sixth
Avenue Access Road and Quail Street. A minor adjustment would be made in the Route 100W
– North Kipling school tripper service to mesh with this change. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100X – South Kipling Express
The former Route 100X had four trips into Civic Center Station (CCS) in the morning peak and
five trips out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 191 boardings. Its service pattern
was replicated by the Route 100Ltd at all of the neighborhood walk-on stops made by Route
100X, as well as at the Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride. Route 100Ltd is heavily interlined and would
require time changes for conversion to Route 100X.
In order to maintain connectivity for non-Civic Center Station bound riders, it is proposed to recreate Route 100X via the Route 100Ltd alignment between Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride and Federal
Center Station, and via the Regional routes alignment between Federal Center Station and Civic
Center, with a short dwell at Federal Center Station (FCS). Minor schedule adjustments would
be made. The fifth (final) trip in the evening would operate between FCS and Ken Caryl and the
reverse peak trips would also operate only between FCS and Ken Caryl and return.

Requirements for revising the route, incremental to the current costs for Route 100Ltd and for
special service that is replacing Route KC, are estimated at 1 peak bus and 6 weekday hours.
Gate assignments would be adjusted at Federal Center Station. The newly implemented Route
CS – Civic Center Station to Federal Center Station short turns trips would be reduced where
replaced by Route 100X. Annualized weekday cost estimated to be $76,400

Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road Express
It is proposed to add a SB AM trip from Thornton Park-n-Ride at about 8:40am, to alleviate the
consistent 20+ passenger overloads on the current 8:45am SB trip. Weekday cost impact
estimated to be $12,700.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
Reduce peak frequency between Nine Mile Station and Ulster/Tufts from every 15 to every 30
minutes. Ridership on peak direction trips averages between 2 and 3 passengers/trip. Savings
= 5.0 hours.
Add 1:37pm and 2:07pm northbound trips from Nine Mile, and 1:45pm southbound trip from
Montbello, to relieve standing loads on current 30 minute midday frequency. Cost: 3.7 hours
weekday.
Anticipated weekday savings estimated to be $13,400 annualized
Route 130 – Yale/Buckley
Modify service through Heather Gardens as follows:
Weekdays southbound, service will operate via Yale and Peoria to Nine Mile Station during the
AM peak and evenings after 7:00pm. Service will operate via Heather Gardens midday and PM
peak.
Weekdays northbound, service will operate via Heather Gardens during the AM peak and
midday, and via Peoria and Yale during the PM peak and evenings.
All Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service will operate via Yale and Peoria.
No cost impact anticipated.

Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Add 4:41am southbound trip from Centrepoint/Sable (feeds H-Line train at 5:23am), and add
4:55am and 5:25am northbound trips from Nine Mile (this productive route – 35 boardings/hour does not start northbound service until nearly 6:00am currently).
Weekday cost impacts estimated to be $23,800 annualized.
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Extend northbound evening service one hour later to 11:42pm from Arapahoe Crossing.
Cost impacts estimated to be $14,500 annualized.

Reroute north-end layover/recovery location to Pace/17th SB, FS and remove current
Deerwood loop, due to constituent complaints received; create deadhead for NB to SB northend turn-around via Pace, Olympia, Pace routing. In addition, due to a request by the City of
Longmont, it is proposed to add an AM school tripper on this route by using the current BOLT
block 27 pull-out. Weekday annualized cost estimated to be $5,300
Routes CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
It is expected that the new Pine Junction Park-n-Ride will be opened during this Fall. Minor
schedule adjustments will be made in preparation for this change. Weekday cost impact
estimated to be $5,900 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow RTD to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to the
former location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips.
No cost impact anticipated
Route JUMP – Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe
It is proposed to remove the excess layover at Erie Community Center in the mid-day and
balance the current trips at Lafayette PnR, WB to ½ hour frequency; will result in some mid-day
schedule adjustments. No resource impact anticipated.
Route KC – Ken Caryl/FC/Denver
This service has been cancelled in favor of operating reinstated service on the Route 116X –
South Simms Express. The annualized savings of $70,300 would be used to operate the 6
weekday trips (3 in each peak period) on the Route 116X.
Route SKIP – Broadway
It is proposed to add one school tripper in the PM from Fairview High School to
Broadway/Walnut at 3:29pm (or as warranted by the BVSD bell-times) due to overloads on the
