BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
COVID-19 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report to comply with federal
laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
On March 24, 2020, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to RTD services as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. RTD’s reduced service delivery plan was effectuated on April 19, 2020 and is
summarized in Attachment A.
RTD employed a well-reasoned, balanced, and equitable approach to determine how best to reduce
services based on the demand, while also serving regional needs and maintaining optimal service for
essential purposes. Priority was placed on preserving access to key activity centers, such as hospitals
and major health care providers, as well as major employment centers. Retaining service in low-income
and minority-populated areas was also important as more ridership were seen on those routes and lines
in those geographic areas in comparison to other areas.
Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved adjustments to RTD services in July 2020 for the
September 2020 Service Change Proposal (see, Appendix A of Attachment B) and October 2020 for the
January 2021 Service Change Proposal (see, Appendix A of Attachment B). With steep declines in
ridership (70% reduction) and an uncertain return to higher demand, service reductions enacted with the
January 2020 runboard are currently in place. Taking a holistic approach, RTD took reasonable measures
to implement service changes equitably dating back to the April 2020 COVID-19 related reductions
through the March 2021 service changes in order to prevent unintentional discrimination.
DISCUSSION
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidance on April 7, 2020 to provide clarity
regarding how COVID-19 preparations impact certain FTA requirements. The guidance details when a
Title VI service equity analysis must be performed for emergency service reductions and changes during
the pandemic. Specifically, if a transit agency chooses to make any temporary changes permanent, then
the transit agency is required to complete a service equity analysis to ensure the changes do not unfairly
impact minority and low-income populations. Of note, a permanent change is any service change lasting
longer than 12 months. The 12-month threshold will lapse April 19, 2021. Thus, an analysis is required
to be brought before the RTD Board of Directors for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is shown in Attachment B.

RTD’s Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Major Service Change Results: Changes to 103 existing bus route/patterns and rail lines in RTD’s
network of 167 services from April 2020 to April 2021 met the established thresholds for a major
service change. The following routes had service reductions or were eliminated:

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Methodology:
Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route level, route block
group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity
or income.
Summary of Findings:
• Of the 103 routes with major service changes or reductions, none had adverse impacts when
comparing the service reductions of equity populations with those of non-equity populations.
Low-income routes had a 13% lower reduction than higher income routes and minority routes had
12% less of a reduction than non-minority routes.
•

Of routes that were major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings, and 27
had potential disproportionate burdens findings.

•

Of routes that were eliminated, 12 had potential disparate impact findings, and 38 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings.

•

Of new services or restructures, 7 routes had potential disparate impact findings, and 6 had
potential disproportionate burdens findings.

•

30 of 40 routes had smaller reductions in service than the corridor’s primary route, and all
eliminated routes had net corridor service changes that reflected a smaller reduction in service,
indicating the availability of other RTD services within one-quarter of mile of the corridor, on
average.

Conclusions:
Title VI concerns are minimal compared to the COVID-19 service reductions and subsequent service
changes in September 2020 and January 2021. Overall, the system-wide service reductions have
impacted equity groups moderately less compared to non-equity groups. However, because some of the
major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact or a disproportionate burden they have
been identified for further examination and will be prioritized for future service increases.
Keeping top of mind, the agency’s on-going response to the pandemic, the substantial ridership decline,
resource allocation, and the recovery timing uncertainty signifies the agency’s substantial legitimate
justification for maintaining the COVID-19 related service changes made in April 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the COVID-19 Title VI Service Equity Analysis does not result in any direct or
foreseeable financial impacts.

Executive Summary
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published guidance on April 7, 2020, to provide clarity how
COVID-19 preparations impact certain FTA requirements. The guidance details when a Title VI service
equity analysis must be performed for emergency service cuts and changes during the pandemic.
Specifically, if a transit agency chooses to make any temporary changes permanent, the agency is then
required to complete a service equity analysis to ensure the changes do not unfairly impact minority and
low-income populations. Of note, a permanent change is any service change lasting longer than 12
months.
With steep declines in ridership and an uncertain return to higher demand, service reductions enacted
within the January 2020 runboard have remained in place until the current March 2021 runboard.
Moreover, RTD reduced service on April 19, 2020, to reflect the reality of declining ridership resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic. Because these changes are approaching the end of 12-month period, the
FTA considers these changes permanent and requires an equity analysis to be performed. This document
summarizes the detailed analysis of the service changes between April 2020 and April 2021 to ensure
changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes,
disparate impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route level, route
block group, and network level, to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
Changes to 103 existing bus route/patterns and rail lines in RTD’s network of 167 services from April 2020
to April 2021 meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below had
proposed reductions to service or were eliminated.

Findings
When considering all routes in the RTD network, and compared to the average 31% reduction in service,
low-income routes had a 13% smaller reduction compared to higher-income routes, and minority routes
had a 29% smaller reduction than non-minority routes.
Of the 103 routes with major service changes or reductions, none had adverse impacts when comparing
the service reductions of equity populations with those of non-equity populations. Low-income routes
had a 13% lower reduction than higher-income routes and minority routes had 12% less of a reduction
than non-minority routes.
Bus routes had a larger cut in service than rail modes, and of these bus routes with reductions in service,
suburban local and regional route service classes had greater reductions or more eliminations than Central
Business District (CBD) local and local route service classes. Limited stop routes were more likely to be
eliminated than local routes.
Of routes that had major service changes, 14 had potential disparate impact findings and 27 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Twelve routes had both.
Of routes that were eliminated, 12 had potential disparate impact findings and 38 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Nine routes had both.
Of new services or restructures, 7 routes had potential disparate impact findings and 6 had potential
disproportionate burdens findings. Three routes had both.
Corridor service changes within one-quarter mile of routes were reviewed for net service area changes,
incorporating the network benefits of overlapping and/or intersecting services. This analysis found 30 of
40 routes had smaller reductions in service than the corridor’s primary route, and all eliminated routes
had net corridor service changes that reflected a smaller reduction in service, indicating the availability of
other RTD services within a ¼ mile of the corridor, on average. However, only the corridor surrounding
Route 37 was found to have a net service change under the major service change threshold of 25%.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that occurred between the January
2020 and March 2021 runboards, representing the prior 12 months of service. Routes with major service
changes include 40 major reductions, 63 eliminations, and 10 added services. In September of 2020, with
the opening of the N Line, a highly anticipated commuter rail line to the north suburbs, supporting bus
services were restructured. As a result, several routes underwent changes that on the surface appear to
be major service changes (e.g., a single route split into two patterns, route name changes, replacement
with other named routes, etc.). These changes and all others have been reviewed individually and in
aggregate at the block group and system levels to identify actual major changes.

1.B.1.b

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD.
These changes include the addition of new routes, the elimination of existing routes, and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of the residents of the District and maintain a highperformance, sustainable transit system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color
or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
•Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and
frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes
within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the District’s responsibility to
identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of
service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to
establish performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The
District uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of
the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider leastcost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.
--Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios -- Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These
policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:

Service Change Philosophy

1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that
includes, but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating
segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the
degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a lowincome population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is
considered a disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who
are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources & Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level.
Analysis of RTD’s network footprint and route service levels utilized Remix, a transit-planning software
package combining data analysis with transit service planning tools. One key evaluation tool is the Title
VI analysis used for service equity analyses which compares existing service, converted into annualized
bus visits, or trips, to a set of proposed service changes. The annualized bus visits conversion is a helpful
proxy for route service changes since any change in service levels will be proportional to the resultant
annualized change in trips. Other data includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking
of these datasets into a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with
changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing impacts.
The equity analysis is a three-tier process reviewing impacts first at an individual route level, then at an
aggregated route block group level, and finally at a District/block group level, being careful to realize that
analyses done at aggregate levels could hide major service change impacts occurring at a more granular
level, so detailed analysis is done at each tier to avoid overlooking potentially adverse impacts on equity
groups.
Low-income status for population within the District derives from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based

on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of 3. Minority status was based on the
non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection
of block groups within the District boundaries set by RTD for Remix.
Route service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around
bus stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of
census block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the
underlying block group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter
mile; if 50% of a block group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population
would count as being included (ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
Remix provides a count of trips in the “before” and “after” networks at the block group level and
aggregated at the route pattern level but does not provide a change of trips by route by block group,
which was needed for more detailed analysis at the route level. For this third tier of analysis, route
alignments from RTD’s General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data were used to calculate the quartermile catchment area of every route to relate the route trip change data from Remix to individual block
groups associated with each route.

The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. The
main comments were related to the opposition of the Route LD and Route LX service change. Other emails
were general inquiries about the Route 37 and 46.
Covid-19 Service Reductions (April 2020)
RTD’s traditional outreach and community engagement was not pursued due to the nature of the April
2020 service reductions. In short, the ability to devise and carry out a robust and inclusive outreach
strategy was limited due to a compressed timeline and resource constraints. This was a result of the sharp
decline in ridership attributed to the coronavirus pandemic. To summarize, the community engagement
efforts, all outreach was conducted electronically via media releases, updates on the main RTD webpage,
email blast to our customers and service alerts on the lines where service was reduced.
Customer Care staff received comments during the Covid-19 service reductions. These comments were
compiled daily and sent to a team of RTD staff. Most comments related to Covid-19 service reductions
were due to being passed up by a full bus, bus overcrowding, and operators or customers not wearing a
mask. Additionally, there were concerns of rear door boarding for customers with a disability as well as
specific route suspensions and eliminations.
Routes that received a high number of complaints for pass ups and overcrowding include routes 12,
15/15L, 16, and 0. Routes 43 and 121 did not receive the same volume of complaints regarding pass ups
and overcrowding but were notably higher than other routes. These local routes have a higher number of
minority and low-income customers compared to the system district average.

Comment Summary
There was a strong opposition to the RunRide suspension due to the BolderBoulder’s 3 use and
dependency on this service. Additional strong opposition was related to the Mallride, Route 99L, 32, 16L,
225, JUMP and 403 service cuts. Of these routes both the 99L and 16L had a noticeably larger number of
people make comments regarding their reliance on these routes to have access to work and other
essential trips. The Route LD trip cuts proved to be a concern for those in Lafayette as it was described
that the current service is already minimal.
Several members of the public voiced concern regarding the R Line, 153, and 157 as they are all routes
some local residents rely on. Residents in Aurora gave mention to already drastic changes in service that
have occurred by RTD in the recent years. Due to issues with connectivity, transfers, and access the D Line
was brought up. Some commenters wanted it to return to how it previously was and there was also a
desire not to end the weekend trips this service provides. Also, two people brought up the conditions of
the Lafayette Park-n-ride. RTD staff informed them it is currently in construction and is being worked on.
Additional comments were made regarding the operator shortage as commenters asked questions related
to what is causing it, and how to solve the issues so cuts do not have to be made. RTD staff fielded
questions to assure the public that resolutions are being identified.
Emails
The public was notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. Emails
were received from all parts of RTD’s service area. Key routes of concern according to email volume
included the Runride, Route 157, Route 153, and the R Line.
Mail
Cards with the words “No to Cuts” were received from residents in Aurora. The cards detailed service
changes of concern that were reflective of emailed comments as well. The key routes of concern included
Route 153, Route 130, Route 169, Route 157, H Line, E Line, and the R Line.

On July 14, 2020 the Board approved the recommended action to approve the implementation of the N
line and subsequent changes related it. It was not considered a service change and modifications were
nuanced changes with the Covid-19 plan.
Public Meetings
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from August through
September of 2019. The meetings were held in Thornton City Call, Northglenn Senior Center, Blake
Street Offices, and the City of Westminster. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public
meetings total. Detailed comments from each meeting can be found in the July 14, 2020 consolidated
agenda starting on packet page 17. 4
In summary the main questions and concerns during the public comment period were the actual date of
the 2020 N Line opening. Approximately seven people made remarks indicating doubts of predicted
2020 opening due to past delays. General questions regarding how the N Line will affect other routes
were the next frequently asked questions. Additionally three people had concerns of the frequency of
the 92/93L frequency. One person mentioned that the 88 on time performance was not accurate and
one other person mentioned a desire to extend the route further. The 104L and 39L going away were of
the most concern to those that spoke at the public meetings.
Email
The public was notified of the ability submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com. One letter
was received from the Westminster Mayor’s office concerns and support for the proposal. Specifically
there were concerns noted regarding the Route 120 boarding location due to the proximity of a high
volume road and the AA projected to have a negative citizen reaction due to added travel time. A
positive note regarding the 114 changes to added connections was also noted.
January 2021 Service Change
Notification was given to customers about the January 2021 service changes via rider alert emails about
upcoming service changes and the opportunity to submit feedback by emailing service.changes@rtddenver.com, faxing comments to 303.299.2227, or calling 303.299.6000.
Virtual Meetings and Events
RTD hosted a series of 5 virtual public outreach sessions in the first half of October 2020 to provide an
overview of proposed service changes. Microsoft Teams meetings were limited to 250 participants per
meeting. Four Microsoft Teams meetings were held with the option to participate via telephone or
through the Microsoft Teams App. The table below shows the dates and number of attendees per

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
Service changes made between January 2020 and March 2021 that resulted in a 25% or greater reduction
or addition in service were categorized by equity grouping (minority or non-minority, low-income or
higher income) for comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their
identification within the January 2020 network using 2018 ACS 5-year demographic data. A comparative

equity analysis was completed to review the routes individually. This analysis identified the equity and
non-equity populations within a route service area and compared those against the equity and non-equity
populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route service area received 10% or
greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route had a potential finding of disparate
impact or disproportionate burden (depending on the impacted equity population) and was flagged for
more detailed review of block groups within the route’s service area. This was intended to identify
network-level impacts that would indicate whether 25% or more service was changed for the underlying
population groups due to overlapping or intersecting services.

Changes by Transit Mode
When annual service changes were reviewed by mode, light rail had a 23% reduction of service over an
annualized count. Commuter rail increased due to the introduction of N Line service and rail overall was
reduced by nearly 16%. Bus service was reduced by nearly 34%. The overall average for the system was
a reduction of roughly 31%.

Major service changes between January 2020 and March 2021 included a total of 103 routes/lines that
received major service reductions or were fully eliminated. Of these routes, 40 had major service
reductions and 63 were eliminated.

Changes by Route Service Class
Service changes were reviewed by service class, categories generally describing the geographic location
or service area (and unique performance thresholds) of each route. Service changes included all major
service reductions or additions. Service classes include 4 categories for bus services: Central Business
District (CBD) Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, and Regional, a rail category, and 3 special services
(MallRide, MetroRide, and the Englewood Trolley). Generally, service cuts were more severe for
suburban local and regional services, than CBD or Urban Local routes. Rail received the fewest cuts,
likely due to mandated service levels on commuter rail services and new N Line commuter service. CBD
locals, and the related downtown services of MallRide and MetroRide as well as Regional services, had
more reductions in service compared to Urban Locals.

Major Service Change Review
A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in
aggregate equity groupings of routes prior to individual review of routes, route block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are
categorized as the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
Routes with major service changes included 40 routes with service reductions of 25% or greater and 63
eliminated routes, totaling 103 routes with major service reductions or eliminations (see table below).

Ten routes were found to have major service change increases, due to their occurrence in the September
2020 runboard and their association with the introduction of the N-Line and related service restructuring.
These included the following routes: N Line, Route 49, Route 88L, Route 93L, Route 104L, Route 120E,
Route 120L, Route 520, Route NB1 and Route NB2.
Routes 49, 88L, 93L, 104L, and 120E/L are directly attributed to N-Line service. Route 520 was part of a
route restructure from the elimination of Route RC and other changes in Brighton. Finally, the NB route
to Nederland was split into two patterns, NB1 (primary route) and NB2 (seasonal).

Route-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in
the analysis is to look at each line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (minority
populations) and/or Disproportionate Burdens (low-income populations). Both service reductions and

Major Service Change Increases

service increases are analyzed. For service increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. For service
decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects of the reductions are
disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
DISPARATE IMPACT AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN ANALYSIS
For each route with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s impacted equity
and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity populations; if the
difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is required for potential
adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were
reviewed for potential disparate impact (DI) or disproportionate burden (DB) findings. In summary, the
review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•
•
•

33 routes met the threshold for a potential disparate impact
77 routes met the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden
24 met thresholds for both impacts

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Route-Block Group (Corridor) Analysis
This analysis reviews service changes reviewed at the route-block group level. This reviews the impacts of
overlapping and intersecting services to determine the “net” service change within a route corridor. For
instance, if an eliminated limited service operated in the same corridor as a local service, the net change
determined from the route-block group analysis would group all the trips together to determine the net
effect of the elimination. This provides an aggregate, high level indication of the average amount of service
provided to the average user randomly across the route’s corridor. It is an imperfect analysis, however,
since it does not provide a true sense of alternative connections to the average user within that corridor
based on how service levels changed for the primary route. However, because many of RTD’s routes
operate within a grid network, it can provide a sense of overall service levels.
ROUTE-BLOCK GROUP (CORRIDOR) ANALYSIS PROCESS
1. Identify routes with major service reductions or increases of 25% or greater and potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings
2. Identify block groups within those route service areas and determine net (corridor) change
in service
3. Routes with alignment changes will compare old and new alignments for impacts
4. Route corridor major service changes of 25% or greater (+/-) should be reviewed for
potential DI or DB impacts as previously determined

Of the 40 routes with major service reductions, the corridor “net” service review found 30 routes that
had a lower net corridor change in service. Of the 63 eliminated routes, all routes had net corridor
service changes with less of a reduction. Table 8 provides a summary of routes with major service
changes, organized by service change type (reduction, elimination, addition), individual route service
change percent between January 2020 and March 2021, and the “net” percent corridor service change.
Routes with green shading are those where the net corridor service change is of a smaller magnitude than
the individual route service change.

1.B.1.b

A network analysis is not typical in RTD’s equity analyses but was used to understand the large number of
service changes occurring across the network. A network level analysis has potential to provide further
understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
While RTD has not established a formal policy for a network level analysis, the major service change
threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as precedent to determine
potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring further review. Once
average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of District block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or
greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes
experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major
service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels
(block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of the combined service changes identified the following:
•

•

•

•

Systemwide, service was reduced by 31.8%, with almost one quarter of light rail service reduced
(existing commuter lines were contractually obligated to be maintained and overall service
improved due to new N Line service) and almost a third of overall bus service cut. Major service
changes were applicable to the entire network.
Due to cratering ridership and difficulty with staffing, 63 bus routes were eliminated, and 40 of
167 total routes had cuts of 25% or more, though the net effect is less when accounting for direct
replacements (such as local routes substituting for limited routes) or changes related to the N Line
opening.
Comparing changes Districtwide and only for areas with major service changes greater than 25%,
low-income block groups and minority block groups received fewer cuts than non-equity block
groups, staying under the 10% difference threshold.
At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes 7 were compared both District-wide and
only for those with major service changes (in this case, nearly all changes were reductions when
excluding new or replacement routes related to the N Line opening). The comparison found that
while the system had drastic cuts, equity routes received far fewer reductions in service than nonequity routes: low-income routes saw 13% fewer cuts than higher-income, and minority routes
received 29% fewer cuts than non-minority routes.

In aggregate, a review of all routes found no adverse impacts between equity and non-equity routes.
Systemwide, although low-income routes had a greater number of annual trips reduced than higherincome routes, the reductions resulted in a 29% decrease in service compared with the 42% reduction in
higher-income routes. The reductions to minority-classified routes were lower, both in terms of annual
trips and percent change, than non-minority routes. As a result, minority routes were reduced 16%,
compared to 44% for non-minority routes.

Based on existence of the route within the January 2020 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus
stops or rail stations. 2018 5-Year estimates were used for population identification.

This pattern continued with routes that underwent major service reductions. Low-income routes
underwent a decrease of 55% in annual trips compared with higher-income routes that underwent a 68%
reduction. Minority routes underwent a 49% reduction in annual trips compared with 61% for nonminority routes.
In terms of major service increases, low-income routes will have 36% more trips than higher-income
routes. Similarly, minority routes will have roughly 5 times as many trips than non-minority routes (74,290
more annually).

For the January 2020 to March 2021 network change, an analysis of all District block groups and their
service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity thresholds for low-income and minority
populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of the January 2020 to March 2021
service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or above the District average
are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher-income and non-minority block
groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

NETWORK ANALYSIS PROCESS
Determine block groups at/above District averages for low-income population (16.8%) and minority
population (35.4%)
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District 8. Using the 2018
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the
total minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the
District-wide low-income and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified
as above average. While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population
of the service area (3.019 million) the low-Income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a
slightly smaller population figure. This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census
Bureau can determine 9. The thresholds summarized in Table 0 yielded 751 (39% of all) block groups above
the District average for low-income population, and 715 (37%) block groups above the District average for
minority population.

Table 11 summarizes the change in trips for equity and non-equity block groups District-wide, only block
groups with major service reductions, and only those with increases. Most block groups across the District
received substantial service reductions, however, systemwide service reductions appear to have
impacted equity groups modestly less than non-equity block groups, but service increases were mixed
with higher-income and minority groups receiving more service than low-income and non-minority
groups. For block groups with a major service reduction, those with above average low-income population
received around 3% fewer cuts, block groups with above average minority populations received around
5% smaller reduction in service compared to non-minority block groups. For block groups with major
service increases, primarily due to the introduction of N line service and restructuring, higher-income
block groups received more service. Minority block groups received nearly 12% more trips than nonminority block groups with major service increases.

Some block groups are not completely contained within the District boundaries due to differences in boundaries
between the District and Census-defined geographies.

The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total
population and results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the location of above average low-income and minority block groups within the
District. Low-income populations and minority populations appear to overlap in similar areas outside of
central Denver, including most of Aurora, Commerce City, and Brighton, and areas east of Boulder, and
areas southeast of Longmont. Low-income populations appear to have greater spread, with additional
areas in the mountain communities and areas west of Downtown Denver.

The January 2020 to March 2021 changes in annual trips by route are symbolized in Figure 6. The purpose
of this map is to provide a generalized view of where service is changing at the route level. The March
2021 bus and rail network, as well as the eliminated routes from the January 2020 network are colorized
according to the percentage change in the annual trips. The March 2021 network resulted in several
routes being eliminated or truncated. These routes and the truncated segments are shown in red. In
instances where several routes serve one corridor, the colors are layered to give preference to green down
to red. Therefore, some truncated segments may not appear as they continue to be served by other
routes. However, routes that have been eliminated entirely but are still served by other routes will outline
the continuing service in red. An example of this scenario is the D-line, which is shown in green and
outlined in red. This is the result of the elimination of the C-line with slight increases in D-line service.
As detailed in the map, the majority of route eliminations are occuring in the periphery of the network
and regional in focus. This includes some of the connections between Longmont and Denver, for example.
Most of the urban core routes will face limited reductions in service, represented in yellow, although some
of the east to west bus connections in the urban core are eliminated. In terms of service increases or new
routes, represented in green, much of it is due to the introduction of N-Line commuter rail service and it’s
related bus services that serve the stations. Some of it is also due to the consolidation of overlapping
services, such as the Nederland routes west of Boulder.

Summary of Findings
The primary objective of this equity analysis was to examine proposed changes to RTD’s network at the
individual route, route block group, and network route and block group levels, to determine if low-income
and minority populations were more adversely impacted with changes than higher-income and nonminority populations. Future analyses may separate network analyses from traditional equity analyses
and network analyses may rely on different service change thresholds and may be subject to additional
refinements to identify potential adverse effects to equity populations. For instance, network changes
could be compared to see how equity areas receive service over time or routes could be grouped into
equity classes to also see how those routes are served longitudinally.
The network changes that occurred between January 2020 to March 2021 include the continuing service
changes originally proposed in April 2020 to address the continuing impacts of ridership and revenue loss
due to the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Ridership behavior has exhibited acute changes that are
without historical precedent. Routes primarily serving office-type jobs (some CBD locals and particularly
Regional services) have seen steep declines as have routes that primarily serve educational campuses
since telecommuting and virtual learning have supplanted in-person interactions. Routes that provide
service for predominantly equity populations, or those who may more likely be essential staff working in
health care, public safety, government, food systems and other service sectors lacking remote work
options, have had fewer reductions in ridership. As such, RTD has prioritized service changes that attempt
to account for ridership demands while maintaining social distancing as much as possible on other routes.
A summary of potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burden findings include the following.
Disparate Impacts
An analysis of routes with major service changes found 40 routes with major service reductions, 63
eliminations and 10 new services. Of the routes with reductions, potential disparate impacts were found
for 14 of the 40 routes, and of the 63 eliminated routes, 12 were found to have potential disparate
impacts. (Twelve routes had both DI and DB findings.) Of routes categorized as new or restructured
services, 7 were found to have potential disparate impacts.
When accounting for corridor service levels to determine a net service change across a route’s corridor,
some routes may have a smaller service change impact. This accounted for overlapping and intersecting
services that may provide a similar level of service. Accounting for this review, only Route 37 had a smaller
corridor service reduction comparing to the route level change. Of the eliminated routes, the AA route
was found to have a service change under -25%.
Disproportionate Burden
An analysis of routes with major service changes found 40 routes with major service reductions, 63
eliminations and 10 new services. Of the routes with reductions, potential disproportionate burdens were
found for 27 of the 40 routes, and of the 63 eliminated routes, 38 were found to have potential
disproportionate burdens. (Nine eliminated routes had both DI and DB findings.) Of routes categorized
as new or restructured services, 6 were found to have potential disproportionate burdens.
When accounting for corridor service levels to determine a net service change across a route’s corridor,
some routes may have a smaller service change impact. This accounted for overlapping and intersecting

services that may provide a similar level of service. Accounting for the corridor review, Route 37 had a
smaller corridor service reduction comparing to the route level change like the potential disparate impact
finding. No eliminated routes had a corridor service change under the major service change threshold.
Table 12 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, provides the individual
route service change, and the net corridor service change. Routes with green highlighted net corridor
service change values indicate routes where the net corridor service change was found to be below the
25% threshold for major service changes. Note that this differs from green highlighting found in Table 8
which identified net corridor service changes that were simply lower in magnitude than the individual
route service change.

May 2020 Service Changes
Due to an ongoing operator shortage, the May Service Change Proposal included a mix of service
adjustments and reductions aimed to prevent missed trips and improve service reliability. The May 2020
Service Change proposals reflected the need to reduce the number of operators necessary to provide
RTD’s transit services, thereby better matching service offerings to the operator headcount at the time.
Changes were approved by the board on the March 10, 2020 during the Operations and Customer Service
Committee as a recommended action. However, the service changes were not implemented due to Covid19. Details of the service reductions can be found in the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 11 starting on

September 2020 Service Change
Under normal circumstances the board approves September 2020 Service Changes at the July Operations
and Customer Service Committee as a recommended action. Due to the nature of Covid-19, the Covid-19
service plan was still in place during the July meeting, however updates were made to the ongoing Covid19 service plan. The list of changes to the Covid-19 service plan were provided to the board on July 14,
2020 and can be found on the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 13 starting on packet page 71.
At the July 14, 2020 meeting, the Board approved the recommended action to implement the N line and
subsequent changes related it. It was not considered a service change and modifications were nuanced
changes with the Covid-19 plan.

•

Introduction of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan under Covid-19 protocols, which provide
Saturday Levels of service for both bus and rail. N Line rail will operate on a 30-minute all-day
frequency

•

Minor schedule adjustments to increase on-time performance on the following services: 15, 21,
30, 31, 83, 204, 326, NB, H, R and W Lines

•

Return of school tripper service operated via Special Service Order, to maximize flexibility, as
school districts complete their plans for the upcoming school year

January 2021 Service Change
The proposed January 2021 service adjustments were a mix of service enhancements, service reductions
and service suspensions in order to maximize ridership within the very limited resources available to the
District as a result of the financial shortfalls resulting from the COVID induced economic slowdown. The
proposals included a mix of service adjustments that represent the redeployment of resources available
during the COVID-19 service plan.
Weekday ridership on local bus service continued at levels approximately 45% of pre-COVID levels while
ridership on Regional services, Flatiron Flyer services and light rail services saw weekday ridership declines
of 75%-85%. These ridership numbers were largely affected by reduced commuter activity and reduced
employment center occupancy.
Overall, the proposals redirected resources from services that were underperforming to services that have
passenger capacity challenges due to limits set by social/physical distancing policies that limit capacity on
each RTD vehicle to approximately 30% of pre-COVID capacity. Additionally, the proposals modified
service patterns and levels of service on rail corridors to more effectively match service to ridership
demand.
The January 2021 service changes were approved by the board on the October 20, 2020 during the
Operations and Customer Service Committee as a recommended action. A list of the approved changes
with a brief summary are included in the Table A-4 below. A full detailed summary of changes can be
found in the FA&A/Ops Consolidated Agenda 14 starting on packet page 144.

Appendix C: Route Service Area Comparative Equity Population
Analysis by Service Change Category
An additional analysis was performed on demographics within subsets of routes within the RTD network.
This analysis extends beyond RTD’s Title VI Program requirements and represents a more granular
examination of potential impacts to equity and non-equity groups. This analysis aims to provide greater
detail on the overall impacted populations within equity groupings of routes by the related service change
impacts. Results from this analysis may be informative when considering future modifications to service
for equity populations.
The population within one-quarter mile of route/line stops/stations was totaled for different tiers of
routes. Total population, minority population, non-minority population, low-income population, and
higher-income populations were totaled within each subset of routes. Each equity population’s
comprising share of the District equity population was determined for comparison purposes, similar to
the route level comparative difference analysis. Routes were categorized by those with major service
reductions/eliminations and those with major service additions. Within those two categories, routes were
further divided into low-income/higher-income and minority/non-minority routes based on the service
area demographics of those routes within the January 2020 network. As with previous analyses presented
in this report, demographics are sourced from the 2018 ACS 5-Year Estimates.
Equity and non-equity populations were compared within each subset of routes. For instance, minority
and non-minority populations were compared within low-income routes that had major service
reductions/eliminations. Similarly, low-income and higher-income populations were compared within
minority routes that received major service increases.
The results from the analysis indicate potential adverse effects to subsets of population by route service
change category. Low-income routes that received major service reductions/eliminations appear to
potentially affect minority populations 14% greater than non-minority populations. When looking at
minority routes that had service reductions/eliminations, minority populations were potentially affected
up to 53% more than non-minority populations.
Low-income populations living with the service area of low-income routes that received a major service
reduction/elimination appear to be potentially affected 40% more than higher-income populations within
those route service areas. For low-income populations within minority route service areas that received
a service reduction/elimination, their potential impact was 42% greater than higher-income populations.
For routes with service increases, minority and low-income populations appear to be potentially
benefiting more than non-equity groups. Service increases for low-income and minority routes appear to
potentially benefit minority populations more than non-minority groups; minority route increases
potentially benefit both equity groups as well. Interestingly, lower-income populations within higherincome routes with service increases benefited nearly 750% more than higher-income populations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Program Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Small Business Office (SBO) created the Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Certification Program to
promote the use of economically disadvantaged businesses in a race-neutral framework. The SBO is
committed to fostering equal opportunity to SBEs and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) by
creating a level playing field, removing barriers and assisting in SBEs/DBEs development so they can
compete fairly for RTD contracting opportunities.
DISCUSSION
The SBO temporarily suspended the acceptance of new SBE Certification program applications in 2021.
RTD currently has 451 active, certified SBEs within its database which can pursue contracting
opportunities with RTD. Considering the temporary suspension, RTD is optimizing relationships with the
City and County of Denver and Colorado’s Department of Transportation to utilize their certification
programs as to not impact SBE’s contracting opportunities, thus the certifications RTD will accept
include:
•

•

City and County of Denver
▪ SBE
▪ Minority/Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE)
▪ DBE
Colorado Department of Transportation’s
▪ DBE

RTD’s Small Business Office will continue to:
• Have a stable SBE Program that aims to increase the participation of SBEs on RTD’s projects
• Create opportunities for SBEs to compete fairly on RTD’s projects and level the playing field
• Assess projects and establish SBE goals on projects
• Manage SBE database of certified firms and process annual updates and renewals for currently
SBE certified firms
• Monitor SBE compliance on all contracts awarded to SBEs or contacts with SBE goals.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD SBE certification program’s temporary suspension was part of the agency-wide 2021 budget
adjustments made as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The savings netted is $184,820 from the
elimination of the Small Business Office’s Certification Specialist position.

Updates for ACPD Committee:
 High Block Vote
Committee Chair Jaime Lewis explained that the purpose of the vote is for the
committee to go on the record taking a stance on the matter and is not to
prevent the committee from continued suggestions to RTD staff.
Joe Lamers made three points:
1. The committee’s role is one of advisory, meaning that RTD staff considers
the recommendations and is not obligated to implement.
2. Policies can be changed and if the high block policy is not working it can
be revisited.
3. The importance of remembering during tough discussions that committee
members and RTD staff are all people.
Earl Lee asked how much of a problem are the high blocks, specifically if their
use and the amount of people using them delay trains. Zamy Silva, Civil Rights
Senior Manager, replied that prior to the pandemic there were not many
concerns. Complaints started coming in once the policy of not allowing anyone
else except persons with a mobility device or mobility impaired customers was
implemented. Anne Hillyer, ADA Investigator/Specialist, who reviews and
generates RTD’s ADA complaint reports, affirmed Zamy Silva’s assertion.

Vivian Stovall noted that the complaints may not be coming to RTD because people
do not always do a formal complaint. She said that the community has complaints,
for example, when a person with a grocery cart full of personal items utilizes the high
block, which is a problem for those using wheelchairs. Vivian Stovall further stated
that drivers are confused because the instructions on who should use the high blocks
are not clear.
Brent Belisle stated that he has been riding RTD for over 20 years and he needs the
high block for his mobility device. He agrees that some people don’t use the high
block properly, but if people need to use them, he is ok with that. Brent Belisle
acknowledged that it is a touchy subject, and that operators should only allow people
with an impairment to sit in the disability seating area.
Kyle Bradell said that it is fine if anyone wants to use the high block but that should
not allow them to sit in the disability area. He suggested painting that area blue as it
is a universal sign for a disability area. Greg Martinez agreed with the blue space
recommendation as people are visual. He suggested using stripes as an option. Vivian
Stovall also agreed saying that people in buses respect the blue areas. Lynn Edmonds
agreed as well with using universal symbols and signs. She wondered what will be
done to enforce the usage of the disability area as drivers can only do so much. Zamy
Silva will discuss identifying the disability area with universal symbols with Dave
Jensen, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, and come back to the
committee with an update. She stated that Cal Shankster will address enforcement
during the updates.
Jaime Lewis explained that his concern is that the ACPD’s mandate is to protect access
to people with disabilities, not the general public. He stated that if the current policy
does not work, the disability community may come back to the committee and ask for
the committee’s action on the matter. The options for the committee are to do
nothing, object and move forward with recommendations, or support the opening of
the high block.
Kyle Bradell moved that the ACPD does not concur with the changes proposed by RTD
to the use of the high block as they will have a negative effect on disability community.
Vivian Stovall seconded the motion.
Vote: Motion carries with 7 votes in favor and 2 opposed.
Yes:

Jaime Lewis, Aaron Pasterz, Brent Belisle, Greg Martinez, Kyle Bradell,
Lynn Edmonds, Vivian Stovall.

No:

Updates on High Block Recommendations from ACPD Members from
November 19, 2020
Cal Shankster, Rail Operations Planning and Systems Senior Manager, updated the
committee on the following recommendations:

1. TSO's should assist conductors, when possible, to assist in securement area
disputes. This will help avoid interruptions in train operations.
Both Mike Meader, RTD’s Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security, and Asset
Management and Bob Grado, RTD’s Chief of Police and Emergency Management, are
on board with utilizing Transit Security Officers (TSOs) to assist with the enforcement
of priority access to mobility devices in the designated area. Staff will assess the
current TSO trainings to evaluate the need for additional training in assisting in this
matter.

2. Explore options for audio recording. "Riders who refuse to move when requested by
RTD staff can be subject to removal "
A message can be added to the system to play intermittently or as selected by the
operator. Staff acknowledged there is a cost and time investment to insert the
message in the system. However, this is important to RTD and RTD will proceed with
this recommendation. RTD staff will email verbiage of the message prior to going live
with the message.

3. Monitor new policy for violations that denies a PWD from accessing train and;
4. Monitor conductors to ensure they are providing instructions on a consistent manner.
RTD conducts regular ride checks with operators for customer service. Reported
incidents are investigated. Non-reported incidents are hard to correct. Current
monitoring and reports give the impression that denying access to people with
disabilities are not a big problem.
Committee members expressed that some operators do not receive the
commendations given by the public and people do not report incidents because they
never hear back on how it was resolved. Staff will investigate on the commendations
as those are important. Staff also explained that customers need to request a call
back when reporting a complaint.
Committee members asked regarding RTD surveys for the public regarding operations
and if the data is public. Staff will invite Jeff Tranguch, Market Research Manager, to
a future meeting to explain the logistics and any background information on RTD’s
surveys in order to assist the data reading the committee might decide to do.

Elevators at RTD Facilities
Sean Moran, Manager of Facilities Maintenance Contracted Facilities, explained that some
elevators at RTD facilities are owned by the agency while others are owned and operated
by other entities with RTD monitoring the maintenance. He clarified that all the calls
regarding facilities are monitored by RTD Police Dispatch at 303.299.2911 or through the
Transit Watch application. These methods of communication are available 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year. Callers are provided with a ticket number and may call back for
reference and follow up. He further noted that RTD has a service agreement with KONE
Elevators with a 90-minute response time. Denver Transit Operators has a service
agreement with Thyssen Krupp Elevators with a 120 minutes response time.
Committee members noted that the elevators at the Englewood, 38th and Blake, and
Sheridan stations are down frequently and have cleanliness issues. They asked if it would
be possible to place signage at all elevators with a number to call when an elevator is not
working. They also asked if there is a central number to call to find out if an elevator is
down prior to reaching the station. Staff replied that Customer Care would have
information on elevators not working as Rider Alerts are issued when an elevator is down.
Staff could place signage with a number for RTD owned and operated elevators and will
reach out to the Legal Department to see what type of signage, if any, can be placed on
elevators not operated by RTD. Staff will reach out to the Committee Chair via email with
an update when staff has had an opportunity to review and work on this matter.
Committee members suggested writing a letter to the governmental entities responsible
for elevators at RTD stations copying each county’s transportation and ADA point person.
The purpose of the letter would be to ask the entities for their help in complying with
ADA requirements and the elevators they operate at RTD related facilities. Committee
Chair will draft a letter and asked Sean Moran to attend the next meeting for an update.

Board is expected to select a vendor at the March Board Meeting with a start date of
May 31 and a 5-year contract.
o A pilot is in development to combine paratransit and fixed route for customers that
may not have access to fixed route but are able to ride it. The goal is to explore if
this combination will help with Access-a-Ride scheduling.
o The requirements for a dispatch system are in development. Requirements would
include accessibility needs for users and staff. The Request for Proposal will be
released in March with the award by the end of 2021.
o A pilot with Uber for zip codes 80013 through 80016 started in October. Participation
is voluntary for ambulatory customers and users of folded wheelchairs. There are
three phases to the pilot with the goal of testing how ride share options can aid during

Access-A-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee
Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities
Jaime Lewis, Chair, called the meeting to order at 10:40 a.m.
1. Updates:
a. ACPD Membership
Jamie Lewis referred the committee members to the conversation via email regarding
ACPD membership terms. The email conversation asked Aaron Pasterz, Brent Belisle,
and Kyle Bradell, whose first term ends on August 31, 2021, if they are willing to serve
a second term. All of them mentioned members agreed to serve a second term.
Anne Hillyer, ADA Investigator/Specialist, asked Jaime Lewis and Vivian Stovall, whose
second term ends on August 31, 2021, if they would be willing to serve another year
on the committee. Jaime Lewis expressed his willingness to serve another year. Vivian
Stovall noted that her availability depends on when she can receive the COVID-19
vaccination.
Jaime Lewis asked the ACPD members to invite other people to apply for the
committee membership. Vivian Morales, Civil Rights Outreach Specialist, noted that
the online application for the ACPD will be active by the end of the month. The link
to the application will be sent to the committee members for recruitment purposes.
b. ACPD’s High Block Discussion Update (13 minutes)
i. Recording – Dave Jensen, AGM Rail Operations

1.C.2.b

Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager for Rail Operations, informed the
committee that he has consulted with RTD’s General Counsel and
Packet Pg. 115

Communications department in finalizing the draft language sent to the
committee via email. He noted that the final language will include wording
similar to “as required by Federal law”. Dave Jensen will send a final draft to
the committee for feedback prior to implementation.
Vivian Stovall commented that the fixed route buses have a blue area reserved
for people with disabilities and that the visual cue was helpful to encourage
other customers to move. Dave Jensen replied that he would look into the blue
are on the buses.
Lynn Edmonds asked if the recording also included a visual announcement for
the hearing impaired. Dave Jensen explained that both the audible and visual
announcements work in tandem.
ii. TSO/Transit Police Training – Bob Grado, Chief of Transit Police; Steve
Martingano, Deputy Chief of Police; Karl Ballard, Transit Police Lieutenant
Steve Martingano explained that Transit Police get messages sent out to them
immediately which they then forward to their team. He said that the emails
sent to security officers with updates to policies and procedures include a
checkbox for the recipient to acknowledge receipt. Transit police and security
officers have the policy of educating first, then following up with policy. Jaime
Lewis asked if there are any reports of transit police and/or security officers
having to engage with customers regarding vacating the space dedicated for
people with disabilities. Steve Martingano replied that there are not any recent
reports which probably has to do with the lower ridership and the lack of
activities, such as parade of lights, that would increase ridership. Dave Jensen
added that ridership being low is another reason why the recording process is
moving a bit slower since low ridership makes it hard to have an idea on impact
on regular ridership.
iii. Universal Symbol on light rail vehicles
Jaime Lewis stated that due to the settlement agreement newer light rail
vehicles have a universal symbol in the area for people with disabilities while
older trains do not have the symbol. Dave Jensen commented that he needed
clarity on what the committee means by universal symbol in the area as all
trains have a wheelchair symbol in the area for people with disabilities. Earl
Lee noted that the issue was trying to change the color of the floor in the area.
Dave Jensen said that his team is evaluating the cost on using paint in the
area. He added that an issue is that only the front of the first car of the train
is used as an area for people with disabilities and that each train has two areas
for when the train turns around. Painting all areas could be confusing for all
customers. Earl Lee agreed that this could generate confusion since the areas
are also used for bicycles when not designated as an area for people with
disabilities. Greg Martinez suggested mimicking the access aisle and using
diagonal blue stripes. Dave Jensen said that he would look into this matter.

c. ACPD Discussion on RTD’s Customer Service Surveys
Jeff Tranguch, Manager of Market Research, gave an overview of how RTD utilizes
surveys. He explained that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires the
Packet Pg. 116

agency to do a customer survey every 3 years for both fixed routes and paratransit
on customers’ satisfaction regarding on time performance, local and regional services,
fares and payment, and demographics. Jeff Tranguch noted that RTD contracts out
that large survey as the agency does not have the capacity to perform that survey
internally. RTD performed the last survey in 2019 and the next one is in 2022. He
said that other surveys are done based on agency needs. For example, a survey was
sent out in the late summer of 2020 to over 400 paratransit customers regarding the
grocery delivery service implemented during the pandemic. Jeff Tranguch pointed out
that another survey done was for the Access-a-Ride customer portal from which
recommendations were received and implemented.
Vivian Stovall asked for clarification regarding the paratransit customer portal. She
wondered if it was a digital application or a web portal. Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager
of Paratransit Services, explained that it is a web portal designed to behave as an
application for ease of mobile use as well as use on a desktop. He will forward the
information on the web portal to both the ACPD and APAC.
Jaime Lewis said he was glad the next survey will be in 2022 as COVID-19 might skew
survey responses. He wondered if Jeff Tranguch and his team were doing surveys
regarding the Uber pilot. Jeff Tranguch said that his team is not involved. Larry Buter,
Manager of Paratransit Services, explained that they are making calls to customers
explaining how the pilot works. To date there have been about 200 trips. He suspects
that trips will increase once the pandemic is over.
Merv Martin, a member of APAC, wondered what percentage of Access-a-Ride rides is
being requested to Uber. Paul Hamilton explained that Access-a-Ride does about 1,000
trips a day. About 200 trips a month are on Uber. He emphasized that the pilot is
limited to zip codes in the Centennial area.
Roberto Cabrera, a member of APAC, wondered if there are other tools or plans to
update resources used near trains specifically for sensory disabilities. Dave Jensen said
that he was interested in the suggestions. He understands that RTD is ADA compliant
and would like to know if there is anything to be done to enhance accessibility given
financial constraints. Dave Jensen asked Roberto Cabrera to reach out to him for
more details.
d. Electronic Crossing Bell
Mark Clendennen, General Superintendent of Infrastructure, Commuter Rail, explained
that the purpose of attending the ACPD meeting was to gather feedback on electronic
crossing bells at gate and pedestrian crossings for commuter rail. The current bells in
neighborhood areas are all directional between 85 and 95 decibels. The suggestion is
to pilot a unidirectional bell between 75 to 85 decibels at the 124th station. He wanted
to engage the community of people with disabilities regarding the proposed pilot.
Jaime Lewis suggested using visual cues to assist with the audio signal. Mark
Clendennen clarified that the pedestrian and roadway crossings have visual lights with
FTA regulations on flashes per minute. The 75 decibel is still within the FTA
requirements. Jaime Lewis will email a person who works at the Colorado CrossDisability Coalition with the deaf community for feedback.

Packet Pg. 117

Greg Martinez reached out to the US Access Board and the board said that they do
not require bells. He asked Mark Clendennen if there was an image or video that
could be shared in order to better understand the unidirectional bell. Mark Clendennen
showed pictures in a document (attached) and this video found on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYgx7D-PFTM. Greg Martinez asked if the bells
had any audible verbiage to alert customers. Mark Clendennen answered that it was
just a bell.
Andi Bailey wanted to ensure that the visually impaired could hear the bell. Mark
Clendennen clarified that the bell is located in between two tracks with flashing lights
adjacent. The roadway crossings have a bell on each side.
Jaime Lewis asked which stations would be next if the pilot proved successful. Mark
Clendennen explained that the goal is for every crossing after collecting data on the
pilot at 124th. He explained that the PUC needs to see data before performing another
pilot at another station. Mark Clendennen stated that since there was no objection
from the group his team would go ahead with the pilot on 124th.
Roberto Cabrera noted that at times stations lack on accommodations for people with
disabilities. Mark Clendennen pointed out that the commuter rail stations have tactile
stripping before entering the train as well as the lights and bells at crossings.
Earl Lee stressed the importance of the placement of the bells being consistent for
people who may be searching for the sound coming from a specific side.
Jaime Lewis invited Mark Clendennen to attend an ACPD meeting after installation to
organize a site visit. Mark Clendennen explained that the next step is presenting
before RTD’s Change Control Board and procurement of the bells. After installation,
he will reach out to the ACPD for a site visit.
2. Other Matters (2 minutes)
a. Elevators at Stations
Jaime Lewis mentioned to the committee that Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil
Rights, and he are working on a letter to send to municipalities responsible for the
maintenance of elevators at RTD stations regarding the maintenance and upkeep of
the elevators.
3. Closing Comments/Adjourn
Jaime Lewis thanked the ACPD members and the APAC members for participating.
