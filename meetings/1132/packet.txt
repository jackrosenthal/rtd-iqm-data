Board Meeting Date: February 5, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve a thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB
Corporation to serve as the consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an amount
not to exceed $2,022,091. It is further recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract, staff
time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These funds will be replenished in the
2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.
BACKGROUND
One year ago, when the RTD Board was considering seeking a tax increase from District voters to
accelerate the completion of the FasTracks program, it became clear that, even with additional
revenue, the completion date for the Northwest Rail would be well into the future. To address
stakeholder concerns, RTD proposed a hybrid option that would provide early implementation of Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) improvements that could address mobility needs since the completion of the rail
would be delayed.
Since the Board opted not to pursue an election, the Northwest area stakeholders have requested
that RTD evaluate a range of mobility options in the in the Northwest Area. The NAMS is RTD’s
response to that request. Specifically, the study will focus on the following elements:
1. Evaluate overall mobility options in the Northwest Area;
2. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and
determine what remaining BRT elements are needed;
3. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line
in segments;
4. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont;
5. Conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown
Express lanes.
Funding for this study was established in November 2012, when the Board authorized the sale of the
air rights at Civic Center Station, and stipulated that a portion of the proceeds be used to pay for the
study.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in December 2012 for consultant assist ance for this study.
A committee, comprised of representatives from RTD staff, CDOT staff and three representatives
from the local jurisdictions, reviewed proposals submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications based selection process. The evaluation considered each team’s technical proposal in the areas of

Packet Pg. 5

2.B.1

Key Personnel Qualifications, Project Understanding and Approach, Team Qualifications, DBE
Commitment, Schedule, and Innovation. The five proposing teams were led by the following
companies: CH2M Hill, HDR, HNTB Corporation, IBI Group, and Steer Davies Gleave. The selection
committee short-listed three teams for interviews and is now recommending that the team led by
HNTB Corporation be approved by the Board. Staff is requesting that the Board app rove this
recommendation and authorize the General Manager to negotiate a contract not to exceed
$2,022,091. Upon successful negotiations, the study will begin immediately and is expected to be
completed by early 2014.
As noted above, the study will have five key components:
1. Evaluate overall mobility options in the Northwest Area;
2. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and
determine what remaining BRT elements are needed;
3. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line
in segments;
4. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont;
5. Conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown
Express lanes.
The NAMS was assigned a 22% Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal. HNTB has committed to
meeting this goal and conducted its own Business Outreach Open House to generate interest in teaming
opportunities for this project. Of the nine DBE firms selected for this team, four are new partners with
HNTB.
The final product of this study will be a prioritized list of improvements for the Northwest area of the
district that has the overall support of RTD, CDOT and our project stakeholders. For each improvement
on this list, the consultant team will develop base year capital and operations and maintenance (O&M)
cost estimates and conduct fatal flaw analyses of technical, financial and environmental issues related to
the improvements.
The data gathered/developed for this study will be essential in informing future RTD decisions related to
the timing for the completion of the FasTracks program that will be grounded in corridor-wide consensus
among study stakeholders. This information will help RTD evaluate future federal grant funding
opportunities, and will provide the private sector with helpful information for determining the feasibility
of future unsolicited proposals or public/private partnerships.
Once a prioritized list of improvements is developed as part of this study, including base year capital and
O&M cost estimates, RTD will then conduct financial analyses [as part of the next Annual Program
Evaluation (APE), not as part of this study], which will reflect various implementation schedules for
completing the remaining FasTracks projects (assuming no additional sales and use tax election).
Specific timing for completion of the remaining FasTracks projects will be determined by the RTD Board
of Directors through the APE process and will be presented for public comment during RTD Board
meetings in late 2013/early 2014, and through the SB 208 submittal due to DRCOG in early 2014.
It should be noted that adding or removing projects from the 2004 FasTracks program could require
approval by residents through a district-wide election, and RTD cannot include improvements that are
not part of the FasTracks program in the SB 208 report to be submitted in early 2014. However if, as
part of this study, RTD and our stakeholders gain consensus that providing cost effective mobility

Packet Pg. 6

2.B.1

improvements in the Northwest area would require a change to the original FasTracks plan, then RTD
staff will present the proposed change in scope to the RTD Board. If the RTD Board approves the
proposed change, then they would have the option to include the scope change in a future election, if
the RTD Board decides to pursue an election at some time in the future. RTD can also consider
submitting any new projects, not part of FasTracks, to DRCOG for inclusion in the longer-term 2040
DRCOG Metro Vision Plan, to be funded outside of FasTracks revenues.
Before any specific project can be advanced into the construction stage, additional environmental
and engineering design work (both of which will require public input) will be required.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this study is provided through the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station. The air rights
sale was completed too late for the sale proceeds and project costs to be included in the 2013 Adopted
Budget, so the project funding will be provided through a transfer from the Transit Development Reserve
until the sale proceeds can be recognized in the 2013 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen -month
professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the consultant for the
NAMS for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091; and it is further recommended that the Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the
consultant contract, staff time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These
funds will be replenished in the 2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights
at Civic Center Station.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a
thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the
consultant for the NAMS for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091; and do not authorize the
transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract
and staff time for the NAMS from funds that would be in the 2013 Amended Budget with
proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.
This alternative is not
recommended because it would delay completion of this important study.

Aconex Contract Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option years on the contract with Aconex, in the
total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management Software as a Service, extending the end date
of the contract to April 2017. Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted
Budget, and future year funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.
BACKGROUND
In April 2010, the RTD Board approved the selection of Aconex to provide an online construction and
document management system for the FasTracks Program. The approved contract was for a three year
term with four one year contract options. Aconex was selected because of its ability to easily set up
web based projects, its search capabilities and its ability to cut down on Document Control staffing
needs, all provided at a reasonable cost to the District.
DISCUSSION
Since the implementation of Aconex in 2010, RTD has been using the system on 20 projects for
FasTracks and Capital Programs. Aconex is used on these projects to manage all construction and
project documentation that is submitted from the contractor, stakeholders or RTD staff. This includes
items such as design drawings, contractor submittals, intergovernmental agreements, and required
reporting for the Federal Transit Administration and other federal agencies. RTD currently has over one
million documents stored in Aconex, and over three thousand RTD staff members, contractors and
stakeholders are using the system. In September 2011, RTD was awarded the Best Team Award from
Constructech Magazine for our use of Aconex on our FasTracks projects.
If RTD were to choose not to exercise the option years on the Aconex contract, RTD would be forced to
stand up an alternative document control system for the FasTracks program. This would require system
evaluation, implementation, configuration, testing, training, and migration of all existing documents to
the new system, which would result in considerable cost and disruption to the major construction
projects which are in progress.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost to RTD to exercise all four option years at this time is $480,000, or $120,000 per year
for four years. If RTD were to exercise each individual option year, the total cost of the contract options
would be $600,000, or $150,000 per year. Therefore, RTD would save $120,000 by exercising all four
option years at once.
Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget. Future year funding will be
appropriated on an annual basis.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option
years on the contract with Aconex, in the total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management
Software as a Service, extending the end date of the contract to April 2017. Funding for this
contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget, and future year funding will be
appropriated on an annual basis.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Exercise the Aconex contract option years on a year by
year basis. This is not recommended because RTD will save $120,000 by exercising all four oneyear options at the same time.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not exercise any of the contract option years for
Aconex and re-solicit for a new construction and document management system. This is not
recommended due to the level of effort, cost, and disruption to ongoing RTD projects required to
implement a new system.

Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix
Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd

Van

Meter,

Assistant

Date: January 31, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 5, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff
to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and
to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro
Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle project at a lower
interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity
under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the
next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that
financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This
action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.
BACKGROUND
RTD staff has developed a RAM that identifies specific cost saving/revenue enhancing opportunities
that, if enacted, would result in additional near-term funding for the FasTracks program. For each of
these opportunities, staff has identified the associated level of risk to the District and presented this risk
assessment to the RTD Board of Directors.
In December, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors approved the first eight recommended opportunities
identified as part of the RAM and confirmed the following goals for use of these funds:


Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;



Construction of NMRL to at least 72nd Avenue;



Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion).

Packet Pg. 22

2.B.3

DISCUSSION
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the following additional RAM items for RTD Board information:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously
assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment.

By approving this action, the RTD Board of Directors confirms their intent to move forward with these
RAM items. Each of these RAM items will be presented as a separate action to the RTD Board of
Directors at future meetings, as required by Bond Counsel.
Staff also recommends that the RTD Board use the financing capacity generated by these RAM items to
extend the NMRL from the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) to 72nd Avenue, which is estimated to
cost between $200 - $220 million (year of expenditure dollars). Approval of this action will allow RTD to
initiate procurement (Request for Proposals) for the NMRL to 72nd Avenue within the next 10 months.
RTD staff has assigned a risk level of “low” to these additional RAM items because they allow RTD to
take advantage of historically low interest rates to build more of the FasTracks program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of these additional RAM items will have a positive financial impact to the FasTracks capital
program by refinancing existing debt issues.
ALTERNATIVES
RTD staff identified the following alternatives for RTD Board consideration.
1.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM)
items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the
NMRL to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously
assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement (Request for Proposals) for construction of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the
next ten months.

Packet Pg. 23

2.B.3

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that
financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This
action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items for other projects.

2.
Alternative #2. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors does not direct staff to move forward with implementation of these new RAM items. This
alternative is not recommended because it would not allow RTD to take advantage of historically low
interest rates that would result in additional funding for the FasTracks program.

RTD FasTracks Strategic Public Information Plan
FASTRACKS PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The PI Program is designed at two levels: a program team to establish and implement public
information, involvement and outreach activities at the program level, and project teams to
facilitate the specific day-to-day project-level work with the project stakeholders.
The Strategic Public Information Plan will pro-actively address:
• Evolving program priorities and project construction initiatives
• Ever-changing and diverse stakeholder expectations
• An increased role in public outreach and education
• Streamlined internal processes to ensure efficient operation

Vision
The RTD FasTracks Public Information Program will provide the communication integration
necessary for consistent, accurate, reliable internal and external communications that support
the RTD FasTracks team vision to provide an enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe transit
system that responds to the growing transportation needs of the Regional Transportation
District.

Mission
The mission of the RTD FasTracks Public Information Team is to communicate the progress
and benefits of the multi-billion dollar FasTracks program to our external and internal audiences.
By employing communication strategies that are comprehensive and integrated, our audiences
will better understand and support FasTracks’ goal of connecting communities through transit
and the improved quality of life it brings to the region.

Goals
•

regional and local markets.
To create and maintain positive relationships with regional constituents.
To continue to establish innovative and cost-effective communications methods.
To present a positive image for FasTracks, its component transit expansion projects,
and RTD.
To create goodwill for FasTracks among its internal and external audiences including
tax-paying constituents (riders and non-riders), advocacy groups, municipalities,
government agencies and the news media.

The RTD FasTracks Public Information (PI) Program establishes and maintains a high level of
communication and outreach to key audiences about the FasTracks program. The
communication function is an essential part of keeping communities connected and engaged
throughout the FasTracks process, ensuring public confidence, and promoting the program’s
success and progress.

2.C.2.b

STRATEGIC APPROACH TO PUBLIC INFORMATION
Team Structure

The teams work as one and are designed to better utilize resources. Previously contracted
services were brought in-house and the team was restructured and more streamlined. Led by
the FasTracks Public Information Manager and the Consultant Public Information Project
Manager, the team supports key projects more cost-effectively in an efficiently run
communications program.

FasTracks Public Information Manager
The RTD FasTracks Public Information Manager oversees a comprehensive communications
program which includes an array of public outreach, public involvement, media relations,
government relations, graphics arts, special events, informational materials, market research
and other public information-related elements program-wide and for each project. The PI
Manager manages RTD and consultant staff, the development of public information plans for
projects under construction and the orchestration of those plans, and serves as the primary
spokesperson for the FasTracks program.

Public Information Consultant (PIC) Project Manager
The Public Information Consultant Project Manager is part of the Public Information Consultant
Team who works in conjunction with the FasTracks Public Information Manager in the oversight
and execution of the communications and outreach programs described above. This includes
day-to-day management support for the FasTracks program and providing strategic advice and
support to the Public Information Manager.

Staffing
Staffing has been aligned both by project and by functional communication discipline. Staffing
requirements are identified based on the RTD FasTracks implementation plan as it evolves from
year to year, with additional staff needs corresponding with the projected timing for project
ramp-up for design and construction. Staffing needs will be analyzed on an ongoing basis as
part of the annual strategic communication planning process.
In addition to the Program Public Information Manager and Consultant PI Project Manager, the
Program PI Team consists of Project Public Information Managers for specific projects; Public
Information Specialists that support the program PI functions; Administrative Assistants; and a
Strategic Community Relations Advisor.

Roles and Responsibilities
Each RTD FasTracks Public Information Team member is tasked as the lead responsible for
one or more functional disciplines; some team members may be assigned as a project liaison
on one or more projects as well. Others are assigned to work exclusively with projects under
construction. The intent of the roles and responsibilities alignment is to ensure consistency and
coverage of the key communication components of the plan. The staff lead for each functional

FasTracks possesses unique elements that require a centralized team to coordinate an
integrated organizational structure that addresses the needs of the overall RTD FasTracks
Public Information program as well as the individual needs of each project. To achieve this, a
team configuration of FasTracks staff and embedded consultants has been identified that will
accommodate both requirements and maximize communication resources.

discipline provides strategic oversight and management with implementation assistance from
other team members as necessary and appropriate. Roles and responsibilities will be analyzed
on an ongoing basis, as part of the annual strategic communication planning process.

Contractor Oversight/Integration/Coordination
Attachment: FasTracks Strategic PI Plan 11-30-12 FINAL 508 (1490 : FasTracks PI Update)

Consistent messages, applicable methodologies and lessons learned must be coordinated
between the RTD FasTracks Public Information Team and the Contractor Public
Information Teams throughout the planning, design, construction and mobilization/opening
phases. This will ensure continuity of vision, expectations and implementation for the
project and, eventually, the system.
To accomplish this, the RTD FasTracks Public Information Team and the Contractor
Public Information Teams require close coordination. The following table outlines the
preliminary roles and responsibilities of the Contractor Public Information Teams and the
RTD FasTracks Public Information Team during the design and construction phases.
These roles and functions will be analyzed on an ongoing basis as part of the annual
strategic planning process.

Project Public Information Phases
The overall strategic public information process will be aligned with the three primary phases of
the RTD FasTracks project:

Each of these three project phases will present unique considerations from a communication
perspective that will be addressed through revisions to this document – the RTD FasTracks
Strategic Public Information Plan. Based on the current RTD FasTracks implementation
schedule, revisions to this plan are anticipated to take place again in 2014 and 2016 to
correspond with the commencement of the design, construction and mobilization/opening
phases across projects. The West Rail Line will serve as the gateway for lessons learned to
apply to each phase, given the project’s accelerated schedule.

Research and Planning
All phases of the RTD FasTracks Strategic Public Information plan will be rooted in solid,
strategic research. Outreach and informational needs will change and evolve throughout the life
of the program, and systematic qualitative and quantitative research will allow the project team
to anticipate trends; proactively address issues; and create and evaluate communication
programs, methods and messages that meet the needs of project stakeholders. The RTD
FasTracks Public Information Team will:
•
•
•

Provide a variety of stakeholder input opportunities
Track stakeholder understanding and opinion
Evaluate the effectiveness of communication methods and messages

Planning Methodology
To address the fluid nature and changing needs of the various RTD FasTracks Program
phases, the RTD FasTracks Public Information Team will develop annual and quarterly strategic
plans for each of the projects that outline specific, measurable outcomes that will focus
resources to support this Program-wide Strategic Public Information Plan.

A brief description of each audience follows.

General Public
Within the eight-country district there are approximately 2.3 million adults who vote and pay
taxes to support RTD FasTracks. About 10 percent of that total currently uses RTD buses and
passenger rail. While the general public is a large amorphous group, there are significant
stakeholders within the general public who have interest in FasTracks’ progress and the
benefits it offers to their specific communities. These stakeholders might include, but are not
limited to:
• Members of the business community
• Members of the K-12, community college and higher-ed community (faculty, staff and
students)
• Members of the 18- to 34-year-old student and young professional commuter population
• Members of the health care community and other nonprofit groups
• Members of the government (non-elected local, state and federal officials, managers and
employees)
• RTD and FasTracks employees
• RTD contractors and sub-contractors
Each of the above has its special needs and interests as it relates to transit.

Elected Officials
Elected officials in the eight-county region are key influencers and represent their constituents
who vote for FasTracks and take advantage of the transit system’s many benefits. It is critical
that the elected official audience be considered in all communications.

RTD Board of Directors
In November 2012, a transition among one-third (five) of Board members occurred following the
general election. One of the Board members leaving due to term limits is the Board Chair. Going
forward, it is critical for the PI Team to be strategic with its Board communications to ensure that
the PI Team assists and supports the Board members with updated and timely information,
consistent messaging, preparation for community presentations and events, and established
processes to contribute to the Board’s positive and proactive engagement as it relates to
FasTracks.

To engender public trust and understanding, the RTD FasTracks Project team will communicate
with a wide variety of key audiences which can be categorized into six groups:

2.C.2.b

Key Audiences, cont.
Media

Meanwhile, network TV news, local TV news and cable TV news audience numbers have
trended up as has radio news listenership. (State of the News Media 2012 – Pew Research)
But more people are also using computers, mobile devices and smartphones to access
information. Traditional news media sources (newspapers, magazines, TV and radio) are also
incorporating digital technology into their news offerings to engage audiences through branded
websites, mobile apps, digital subscriptions, social media pages and video feeds.
Since the general media audience is more segmented than ever before, the FasTracks PI
media strategy must be segmented as well.
Locally, only a few reporters regularly cover transit as a beat. The others are general reporters.
It is incumbent on the FasTracks PI staff to educate and inform local print and electronic media
reporters and influencers about FasTracks progress and its many community benefits.
National transit media and national/international media (print and electronic) are much more
attuned to transit issues and savvy to the industry’s nuances, economics, politics and
community benefits.

Agency Partners
RTD FasTracks interacts and collaborates with a variety of Agency Partners who help fund
construction, build-out projects, support regulation and public policy, and advocate for transit
solutions. Agency Partners can be further defined as:
• Public Private Partnerships (P3)—the firms who provide funding and construction
expertise
• Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) which oversees regional transit
planning and funding
• Citizens Advisory Committee—a 17-member group of citizens who serve to offer regionoriented advice on the implementation of the FasTracks program
• Public Information Officers (PIOs) who represent municipalities and need to know how
FasTracks impacts their communities
• Transit Advocates—groups and individuals who support FasTracks and regional transit
solutions
• Business—economic and chamber groups which support economic development

Citizens Advisory Committee
The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is a 17-member group of people who advise the
District on matters relating to the implementation of the voter-approved FasTracks Plan. The
CAC was established by the RTD Board of Directors in 2004 and represents broad stakeholder
interests as its members are geographically represented throughout the RTD District. The
Committee holds monthly work sessions to review program initiatives and issues, and holds
quarterly meetings around the district to gather input from citizens.

STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN
Strategic communication assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship between an
organization’s communication activities and the success of the organization's mission. To that
end, the RTD FasTracks Public Information Team has established four strategic priorities
identified below that will be supported by six strategic communication functional areas to ensure
a cohesive, consistent public information program is administered throughout the project.

Promoting progress on FasTracks projects throughout the eight-county district will
present tangible proof of construction progress to the general public and stakeholders.
This will also communicate that FasTracks funds are efficiently used and managed. The
more positive information the PI Team can show about progress on a consistent basis,
the more it will further awareness, understanding and support for the program.
A combination of traditional and social media, special events and public outreach will be
used to strategically and pro-actively educate the public about FasTracks construction
progress. A focus on grassroots and community-based outreach will enhance the PI
Team’s efforts at addressing the information needs of the region. Promoting progress
will also demonstrate how FasTracks provides new jobs and economic growth for the
region.

Regional Collaboration
RTD values regional collaboration across the district’s eight-county region in the
development of the FasTracks transit expansion program. The FasTracks team is
committed to working with local governments, partnering agencies, businesses,
community and neighborhood groups, educational institutions, nonprofits, the media and
the public in finding common ground and perspective as the agency builds out the
program.
Regardless of economic, political or financial conditions, RTD will continue to work with
its regional partners to seek out alternatives and innovations to complete the FasTracks
program as soon as possible.

Community Benefits
RTD FasTracks is an integral part of the communities it serves. As an accessible
organization, RTD strives to connect riders to the important places and resources in their
lives while helping to create communities that improve the lives of non-riders as well.
As the expanded transit system is built throughout the eight-county district, FasTracks
will utilize strategic initiatives of public outreach and creative promotions to publicize the
array of community benefits for each corridor.

Personalizing FasTracks
Personalizing FasTracks with our communities and stakeholders will help to create
understanding, trust and support for the program.
There are people who make FasTracks a reality and there are people in the community
who will benefit from improved transit services. Personalizing FasTracks will
demonstrate how the program is an integral collection of people who touch many facets
of the public’s day through work, play, worship, travel, studies and more.

Promoting Progress

2.C.2.b

An effective crisis communication plan is critical to successfully managing the flow of information
during crises and emergency situations. With multiple projects under progress at the same time,
the RTD FasTracks Program presents some unique challenges in the area of crisis
communications. Given the magnitude of the project, the high level of interest in the community,
and the number of entities and stakeholders involved, the RTD FasTracks Public Information
Team develops a Crisis Communications Plan in conjunction with the construction teams and
other agency partners.
Three elements key to successfully managing crisis communications:
1. Have a plan in place and ensure that everyone understands it. Even the most solid crisis
communications plan will eventually fail if every person on the project has not been
properly trained as to what he/she should do during a project incident or crisis.
2. Deliver a clear, concise message to stakeholders in a forthright and timely manner.
Responding quickly and clearly during incidents and crises is the most effective way to
minimize potential impacts.
3. Limit the number of people who speak for the project. The best way to ensure that
accurate information is disseminated is by having one voice communicate that
information.
The Crisis Communications Plan will support the following goals:
• Ensure accurate, consistent and timely communications—both internally and externally
• Eliminate or minimize confusion and rumors
• Protect the reputations of the Project team members
• Maintain credible relations with public officials, emergency response providers, the media,
the public and all mutually identified stakeholders
• Identify and clarify responsibilities and ensure Project staff preparedness
The Crisis Communication Plan was initially developed in 2006 in conjunction with the project
teams that were assigned to the project. Representatives from participating emergency service
providers and impacted municipalities also participated in plan development, to ensure interagency coordination and cooperation where necessary. The Crisis Communication Plan is
reviewed annually and updated as needed. Contact lists are reviewed and updated on a quarterly
basis.
The Crisis Plan will include the following components:
1. Purpose
2. Crisis/Incident definitions/Potential scenarios
• Corresponding dissemination, lead and spokesperson responsibility: The plan will
identify according to these definitions, who will take the lead on specific incidents.
o Designated staff within each organization to respond to the defined incident

o

Key Project messaging criteria: Specific guidelines will be outlined for the
established messaging criteria that must be incorporated into all crisis
messaging

4. Internal notification procedures
• Emergency contact list: The contact list/notification tree will be developed and
updated in conjunction with the formation of the final Crisis Plan and will follow the
divisions established through the incident definition section outlined above.
• List of emergency service providers: This list will also be incorporated into the
telephone tree following the incident definition process.
5. Crisis Communication Center
• Roles and responsibilities checklists
o Media spokesperson
o Government liaison
o Internal liaison
o Public liaison
6. Spokesperson procedures
• Specific spokesperson procedures will be established in cooperation with the
designated spokespersons from our participating Partner Agencies and Emergency
Response Agencies. This will facilitate consistency of response, regardless of which
agency is the lead for a specific incident within a specific corridor.
7. On-site procedures
• On-site procedures provide the critical guidance necessary to effectively manage
incidents and crises at the site level.
o Media control: Media control procedures will be established to ensure the
consistent, effective handling of media needs during crisis situations.
o Safety zones: Safety zones will be pre-established for each job site throughout
the corridor.
o Steering statements: Recognizing that crises happen “in the moment,” it is critical
to have pre-approved steering statements in place to assist the first on-site point
of contact in accommodating the needs of the media until the designated
spokesperson arrives.
8. Subcontractor requirements
• The plan will include a section on subcontractor requirements relating to crisis
communication and media relations procedures. These established requirements will
be included in all subcontracts.
9. Crisis communications toolbox.
• A toolbox of materials will be developed as needed, according to project phase, to
increase the effectiveness of crisis communications planning.

Media training material: A media and crisis training program will be developed
specific to the nature of this project. A comprehensive training program will be
developed and provided at all levels of the project team to ensure a comprehensive
understanding of roles and responsibilities as they apply to media relations.

•

Laminated crisis communications wallet cards: These provide detailed internal
communication notification procedures for work crews and serve as a quick and
convenient reference tool during emergency situations.

•

On-site procedure cards: This laminated document provides detailed procedural
information for work crews regarding emergency communication response in the
field.

•

Toolbox briefing sheets: Toolbox briefing sheets are used by superintendents,
foremen and safety personnel as a quick reference to brief crews about emergency
communication procedures once construction commences.

•

Pre-approved statements and news release templates: Sample news releases and
statements will be drafted based on the potential scenarios.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 30, 2013

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 30, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 5, 2013

Subject:

Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors support Senate
Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by third parties at or near Regional
Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators
to make any amendments consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter
into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require
Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private
operation under the amended legislation.
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has a limited set of circumstances where it can charge patrons for parking—parking over
24 hours, parking for someone who resides outside the RTD taxing district, and reserved parking spaces
(up to 15 percent of the total number of available spaces). RTD parking facilities are broadly defined by
statute to include facilities owned, leased, or used by RTD. Some municipalities and private developers
have requested RTD’s cooperation in providing opportunities for construction of public pay parking
structures at or near mass transit stations. This could include all RTD patrons, not just those parking for
more than 24 hours or out of district riders.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s restrictions on charging for parking are adding to the challenges of implementing Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) and more specifically of developing parking structures. The language of Senate Bill
13-027 changes the current legislation to allow third parties (local jurisdictions or developers) to be able
to charge for parking for purposes of providing a revenue source for funding parking structures. RTD
would not receive the revenue from the parking fees.
There are several benefits of this bill. Local jurisdictions could facilitate better land use if third parties
construct a structure, rather than RTD building a surface parking lot. Transit patrons and other members
of the public could have more available parking spaces with this private or city involvement as uses
would not have to be clearly segregated. Finally, this bill will allow RTD to manage its resources more
efficiently if we are not expending funds for surface or structured parking.
At the present time, the current situations where the results of passage of this bill may be applicable
include the Boulder Transit Village, Olde Town Arvada TOD Pilot Project (Gold Line), the Westminster
Station (Northwest electrified segment), and the Iliff Station (I-225).
Boulder has requested that RTD enter into an IGA committing that RTD would not allow conversion of
an existing facility in the City to private operation and charges without Boulder’s concurrence. Boulder
would have a 30-day review for any proposals. RTD has two facilities that would be affected by the
proposed IGA, the Table Mesa park-n-Ride and the Tantra Drive park-n-Ride.

RTD could realize savings from not needing to construct a parking lot or structure. The third parties
will be constructing the parking structures and collecting the revenues generated to offset the cost of
construction.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that
the Board of Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by
third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s
lobbyists and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments consistent with Board of
Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the
City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned
park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private operation under the amended legislation.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This action is not recommended because local jurisdictions
desire the ability to make good land use decisions for their communities and facilitate transit oriented
development, and this bill allows RTD the ability to manage its resources more efficiently.
