It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091.  It is further recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract, staff time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS.  These funds will be replenished in the 2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.

#### 2. Aconex Contract Extension

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option years on the contract with Aconex, in the total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management Software as a Service, extending the end date of the contract to April 2017.  Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget, and future year funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.

#### 3. Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:

- Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;

- Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);

- Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;

- Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.

#### 1. Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent.  In addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private operation under the amended legislation.
