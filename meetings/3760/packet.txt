February 20, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a position on Senate Bill 25-161 (SB161) regarding transit reform.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Julien Bouquet, Board Chair
Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD developed its Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program to serve as a guiding document for staff to
pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document
that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy
positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
SB161 was introduced on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, and assigned to the Senate Transportation and
Energy Committee. The full text of the bill is appended to this report.
DISCUSSION
Provided below for the purposes of discussion by the Board of Directors is a section-by-section summary
of SB161.
•

Section 1 – Legislative declaration

•

Section 2 – Adds language stating the Board of Directors has the authority to enter into service
partnership agreements. RTD currently has the authority to enter into service partnership
agreements such as agreements related to service in Boulder County or any of the agencies
Partnership Program service agreements

•

Section 3 – Directs RTD to align with goals set in the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Target,
establish employee retention goals, and develop performance measures to evaluate progress
related thereto; and to follow federal regulations related to assaults on transit workers

•

Section 4 – Requires RTD to:

Develop a 10-year strategic plan (plan) by April 10, 2026, to be updated every four years
Conduct a comprehensive operational analysis (COA) at least every five years beginning in
2026
Routinely report to the Board regarding the plan and COA
Study or contract with a third party to study and identify opportunities to increase funding
to achieve the goals, measures, and targets identified in the plan
Create, maintain, and publish a series of public information dashboards
Update policies related to service standards, equitable transit-oriented development, and
service buy-up policy
Notify the Denver Regional Council of Goverments and the Department of Local Affairs of
any known infrastructure gaps that exists within specific areas of a transit-oriented
community within the agency’s service area
Implement EcoPass program updates, to promote the program, and to streamline bulk
purchases

•

Section 5 – Requires the transportation commission to develop and publish best practices and
technical assistance materials concerning the creation of regional transportation authorities to
increase funding for transit and to provide additional transit services within the state

•

Sections 6 and 8 – Add two ex officio Directors to the Board of Directors and establish a process
for ex officio Director vacancies

•

Section 7 – Prohibits write-in candidates for the Board of Directors

•

Section 9 – Within the Colorado Energy Office, creates an accountability committee, comprised
of appointed members external to the agency along with two ex officio members of the Board of
Directors, to evaluate and make recommendations with regards to RTD governance, board
member compensation, executive compensation, representation of local jurisdictions and state
agencies, and employee retention. Requires a report on findings and recommendations be
submitted to the General Assembly by January 30, 2026

FINANCIAL IMPACT
As introduced, SB161 requires RTD to produce a ten-year strategic plan, a comprehensive operational
analysis beyond the scope of current staff planning, update service standards, and create new public
information dashboards beyond current requirements in state law. Staff has not determined which, if
any, of these tasks can be completed in house without appropriated funding authorization. Funding
sources to complete these requirements have not been identified and will need to be addressed on a
case-by-case scenario; the 2025 Budget or external grant opportunities are potential funding sources for
one or more of these requirements.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – February 2025

February 20, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, January 23, 2025. This report was prepared on
Monday, February 10, 2025, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee
meeting scheduled for Thursday, February 20, 2025.
Federal
At the federal level, Marc Molinaro has officially been nominated to serve as the next Administrator of
the Federal Transit Administration. Molinaro served as the U.S. Representative for New York’s 19 th
Congressional district for one term (January 2023 through January 2025) and was a Member of the
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee during his tenure.

Packet Pg. 34

1.5.1

With regard to funding, staff, working alongside the agency’s contracted federal liaison team, has not
identified immediate impact at this time to federal funding apportioned to the agency as a result of any
White House Executive Order or policy directive issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Staff
will continue to monitor federal policy directives closely and report any impacts to the Board of
Directors.
State
As anticipated and noted during the January 2025 Executive Committee meeting as part of the
Government Relations Report, a bill focused on RTD, Senate Bill 25-161 (SB161), Concerning Transit
Reform, was introduced and assigned to the Senate Transportation and Energy Committee on Tuesday,
February 11, 2025. Prior to the writing of this report, draft legislative language was circulated to the
entire Board of Directors, staff, and external stakeholders for review and comment; the bill as introduced
reflects the draft version that was previously circulated. Staff’s initial comments were solely intended to
convey information related to a potential fiscal impact and ability to implement proposed concepts. Initial
comments do not represent the Boards’ position on the potential bill.
Regarding additional state legislation, staff has engaged with the Office of the State Auditor and the
Legislative Audit Committee to support an audit recommendation bill, SB051, related to the definition of
the agency’s “operating costs,” as that term is defined in state statute. SB051 was passed by the
Senate, introduced in the House on Thursday, February 6, 2025, and assigned to the Transportation,
Housing, and Local Government Committee.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On January 25, 2025, staff was invited to join and present at the Metro Mayor Caucus annual
retreat. Additionally, staff and RTD’s contracted local public affairs liaison, Catalyst Public Affairs, are
aware of a conversation held at the Board retreat on Saturday, February 1, regarding outreach and
engagement opportunities with local elected officials and stakeholders, and eager to assist in facilitating
these efforts.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Board Operating Guidelines 2025 Review and Proposed
Amendments

February 20, 2025

REPRESENTATIVE
Julien Bouquet, Chair
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In February 2008, the Board developed the first version of its Operating Guidelines to improve
communication between Directors and staff as well as the overall effectiveness of the Board’s work. The
Board subsequently revisited the guidelines in 2014 and later overhauled the guidelines in 2018. In
2019, the Board passed resolution No. 1 Series of 2019 “to recommit annually, during a meeting in the
first quarter of each year, to uphold these principles and to amend them as necessary to reflect current
practices.” Subsequently, the Board amended these guidelines in May 2024 and again in September
2024.
DISCUSSION
After taking feedback from Directors, Chair Bouquet is proposing the following adjustments to the
Operating Guidelines to set guidelines on the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Engagement of staff time
Cooperation and communication regarding elected official outreach
Length of time each Director should speak on a topic
Role of the meeting chair in ensuring efficient meetings
Length of time dedicated to each agenda item
Professionalism and respect expected in communications with staff

Directors are asked to review the current Board Operating Guidelines as well as the proposed
amendments offered by Chair Bouquet and offer suggestions for additions, subtractions, or other
changes. Changes with consensus support will be included as part of an action item in March.
This discussion aligns with Community Value and Employee Ownership as how Directors engage with
staff and one another directly impacts the value the Board can provide to the community and models
behavior for others at the agency.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES
LAST UPDATED: SEPTMEBER 24MARCH 25, 20242025
BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to public transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when
it focuses on and helps clarify policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital
and operating budgets. In setting policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and
mission of RTD and its immediate and future priority objectives for coming years as well as the
long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position RTD to be able to respond
flexibly, effectively, and transparently to unique factors as they present, including the current
organizational shift in focus from capital development to operations and maintenance with the
exception of identifying suitable solutions to finish the remaining FasTracks projects, challenges
in optimizing service levels in order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of evolving
transit technologies, in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. As elected
officials, we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility
to each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy-setting and executive functions it must
perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through considered deliberations. Thus, we
value openness in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We
also place a premium on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that
issues will vary in their complexity, we value timely decision-making.
STEPS TO ENHANCE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS

amongst Board members and agency leadership, we, the members of the RTD Board of
Directors, support the following efforts:
REGARDING GOVERNANCE POLICY-SETTING

To strive to effect organizational change through interactions with the General

the body, rather than through the actions of individual Board members

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 - First Semiannual Report on Director Requests

February 20, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
One of the primary functions of the Board Office is to assist Directors in obtaining answers to their
inquiries. In this regard the Board Office serves as a clearing house for Director requests and liaises with
the appropriate department to ensure an accurate and timely response.
Further the Board Operating Guidelines call for a semiannual update on the volume and nature of
requests sent by the Board to staff. This discussion was placed on the Executive Committee’s work plan
and the associated materials have been developed to honor the Board’s Operating Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
The Board Office has experienced a significant increase in the volume of requests from Board members
relative to 2022. Additionally, in March 2023 the Board Office transitioned to a new tracking system
based on RTD’s Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) system. This new system greatly
increased the tracking and data collection capabilities of the Board Office.
The tables below and attached the presentation provide an overview of the volume, nature, and sources
of requests.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Continuing Education Efforts for the Board of
Directors

February 20, 2025

REPRESENTATIVE
Julien Bouquet, Chair
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board has several Bylaws and policies that document its commitment to investing in the continuing
education of Board members. Through its enactment of and adherence to its Bylaws and policies, the
Board has remained committed to the development of its members skills knowledge. This commitment
helps to ensure Directors can be effective in their roles as possible.
Article IV, Section 5 of the Board Bylaws stipulates that “at the beginning of each year, the Board will
schedule Study Sessions…for the purpose of in-depth study of subjects or additional relevant training for
the Board.” Further the Board’s Orientation, Onboarding, and Continuing Education Policy approved in
October 2024 sets forth a number of related items:
•
•
•

Continuing education will occur at least once annually
The Board Office will survey Directors and subject matter experts each October to identify the
areas where the Board may benefit from additional education
The Executive Committee is responsible for identifying the training topic(s) for the Board’s
continuing education each year

In the fall of 2024, the Board Office conducted surveys of staff subject matter experts (SMEs) and the
Board of Directors receiving nine and seven responses respectively. Additionally, the Board Office
disseminated the 2025 Policy Objectives form to Directors and received several requests for study
sessions. Between the assessments mentioned above as well as the Policy Objective submissions, SMEs
and Board members identified a number of areas where they thought the Board could benefit from
additional education. Many of those have already made it on to work plans and or are covered in the
training policy for incoming Directors.
The below items were recommendations from SMEs and Directors that are not covered in a draft work
plan or have an associated training scheduled:
•

Best practices for engaging with media

Packet Pg. 56

1.5.4

•

•
•

Long-term financial trajectory and the associated constraints relative to ongoing maintenance
needs and debt capacity and how that impacts goals associated with a facility and fleet transition
or additional rail expansion
Mobility hubs and how they relate to first mile and last mile solutions
State of good repair with respect to bus and rail fleets

The below items were identified by SMEs and Directors and have and have an associated new Director
training scheduled or are slated to be covered in a work plan of one of the Board’s standing committees.
However, they are mentioned here to draw additional awareness to the Board as opportunities for
continuing education for Directors whose tenure on the Board commenced prior to 2025.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (training slated for week of 4/1)
Civil Rights Title VI Requirements (training slated for week of 4/1)
Cybersecurity Risks (training scheduled for 3/6)
FasTracks (discussions slated for March and June at Finance and Planning Committee)
Paratransit and Access-on-Demand (scheduled for 3/20)
Safety and Environmental Compliance (training scheduled for week of 6/3)
Transit-Oriented Development (training scheduled for 2/18)

DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the list of study session and training opportunities above for which a
session has not been scheduled and discuss the merits of setting aside time to further educate Board
members on the stated issues. The Committee is also asked to identify any additional training topics that
could be of value to the Board.
Note that in the attached 2025 Board meeting schedule, the Board Office has held certain dates
throughout the year for potential study sessions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no anticipated financial impact to the Board engaging in continuing education efforts as outlined
in the report.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Executive Committee Work Plan

February 20, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Article VI, Section 4 of the Board Bylaws details the purpose of and process for approving committee
work plans as follows:
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for
review an annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the
fiscal year. The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s
chair, vice chair, and the responsible RTD staff with the input of the committee’s members. The
work plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year.
Work plans for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing
committee’s work, extend through February of the following fiscal year. Adjustments and
additions to the work plan can be made by the committee chair in consultation with the
committee vice chair and responsible RTD staff.
Additionally, Article VI, Section 1, c.), describes the role of the Executive Committee as follows:
The responsibilities of the Executive Committee include: establishing the agenda for each regular
meeting of the Board; addressing public affairs of the Board; managing external relationships on
behalf of the Board; reviewing and recommending positions on relevant legislation; overseeing the
internal governance of the Board; reviewing the Board Office budget; reviewing the performance
of the Board Office Executive Manager; planning Board retreats; and other ministerial matters
affecting the Board.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
additional input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in
the draft document.

Packet Pg. 60

1.5.5

Following the discussion at the committee meeting on January 23, 2025, General Manager and CEO
Johnson, Board Office Executive Manager Kroll and General Counsel Snyder met with the Board Chair
Bouquet and Board First Vice Chair O’Keefe to further refine the work plan. The Board Office also
solicited further input from Directors on items they wish to see on the work plan via the Policy
Objectives form. Following the discussion in February the committee will work to approve its work plan
at its meeting scheduled for March 20, 2025. Per the Board Bylaws, all committee work plans must be
approved by the end of March each year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the discussion regarding the Executive Committee’s work plan.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Executive Committee’s ability to effectively govern directly
impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure RTD’s resources
are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more focused,
collaborative, and obtainable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Records Request Fee Waivers for Members of the Media

February 20, 2025

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Nicholson, Secretary
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is committed to transparency and to making its records available to the public for inspection as
provided by the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) and Criminal Justice Records Act (CCJRA). The
agency receives hundreds of requests for its records each year. These requests are submitted through
RTD’s online CORA portal: https://www.rtd-denver.com/open-records. Requests come from a variety of
requestors, including customers, academics, other governmental entities, RTD employees and Directors,
claimants or their counsel, and members of the media. See the data attachment to this report for
historical information on requests. The agency has one employee in the Information Governance and
Management Division within the General Counsel Department who serves as the agency’s records
custodian and coordinates the collection and review of records in response to requests. Sections 24-72205(6) and 24-72-306(1), C.R.S. allow governmental entities to charge a fee for the research and
retrieval of records. Under CORA, effective July 1, 2024, the maximum hourly fee is $41.37 with the
first hour being free of charge. Currently, RTD charges $30 per hour. Requestors, after making their
initial request, are provided a fee estimate for the amount of time over one hour needed to produce the
requested records and can decide whether to pay the fee or narrow the request. The timeframe for the
agency to produce the records is tolled until the requestor submits the fee.
CORA requests and CCJRA requests for records of official action must be fulfilled within three business
days; however, should a CORA request require additional time for staff to compile, the agency will notify
the requestor of the extenuating circumstance and will have an extension of up to seven business days.
Under CORA, public entities may waive fees for records used for a public purpose, including public
agency program support, nonprofit activities, journalism, and academic research. Under CCJRA, fees
may be waived in the criminal justice agency’s discretion. Because staff time is needed to research and
respond to records requests that could otherwise be devoted to the agency’s primary mission, RTD does
not grant fee waivers.
Research to date has not identified any other governmental entity in Colorado that waives records
request fees. Research did indicate that the State of South Dakota waives fees for the first $100 of
photocopies for members of the media. Other research has discovered that the City of Boulder has an

exemption whereby students requesting documents related to a school assignment need not pay fees
related to their CORA request unless their request involves extensive staff time. Finally, some
governmental entities have specifically stated that certain custodians of records (e.g., city manager,
town clerk) have the discretionary capacity under the respective statute to waive or reduce fees when
the request is made for a public purpose.
DISCUSSION
It is proposed that the Board act by way of resolution to waive the first $1,000 of fees (with a
maximum of $3,000 per employer) for certified members of the Colorado Press Association and
Colorado Broadcaster’s Association.
The Committee is asked to discuss the merits of the proposal contained in the attached resolution. If
there is consensus support the item will return as an action item at the Committee’s March meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
If the proposed resolution were to return as an action item and be subsequently approved, there may be
a financial impact arising from both foregone fees and a potential increase in staff time devoted to
responding to requests. Should the item move forward, staff will further refine estimates of the financial
impact. However, hard estimates may be challenging to come by given the extent of Colorado’s media
landscape

WHEREAS, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) recognizes the vital role that journalists
play in informing the public about issues of local and regional importance; and
WHEREAS, the Colorado Press Association and the Colorado Broadcasters Association represent
credentialed professionals dedicated to upholding transparency, accountability, and public
engagement; and
WHEREAS, the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) and Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act
(CCJRA) are an essential tool for enabling media access to public records, which fosters a wellinformed citizenry and supports the principles of good governance; and
WHEREAS, the cost of CORA and CCJRA requests can be a barrier to accessing public
information, particularly for smaller media organizations and independent journalists, thereby
potentially limiting the public's access to critical information; and
WHEREAS, RTD is committed to promoting transparency and accessibility while ensuring that its
policies reflect equitable support for those who serve the public good;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation
District:

employer per calendar year.
2. Eligibility Verification: Requesters seeking the mass media waiver must submit an
application which either:
a) provides proof of current employment by a voting organizational member of either the
Colorado Press Association or the Colorado Broadcasters Association
or;
b) sufficiently demonstrates to RTD that the applicant is an active member of the
Colorado mass media, as defined in Colorado’s press shield law (C.R.S. § 13-90-119).
3. In addition to the waiver for active members of the mass media, in keeping with C.R.S. §
24-72-205 (4) The Regional Transportation District may, without creating any enforceable

CITY OF BOULDER
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS

EFFECTIVE DATE: December 3, 2001

_________________________________
Nuria Rivera-Vandermyde, City Manager

AMENDED DATE:

POLICY
It is the policy of the City of Boulder (City) to make public records available for public
inspection at reasonable times in accordance with the provisions of the Colorado
Open Records Act, C.R.S. §§ 24-72-201 et seq. (CORA). This policy (Policy) is
intended to be consistent with and implement the provisions of CORA.

II.

PURPOSES
The purposes of this Policy are to:
A. Set forth the general procedures for providing consistent, prompt, and
equitable access to and inspection of public records maintained by the City
across all departments.
B. Foster open and accessible government while also protecting the integrity of
the City’s records.
C. Prevent unnecessary interference with the regular operational duties of City
employees that may be caused by access to the public records.
D. Establish reasonable, standardized fees for the research and retrieval of Citymaintained records as well as for the review, analysis, redaction, preparation,
and production of copies of public records.
E. Provide general guidelines to assist City employees in handling public
records requests.

III.

APPLICABILITY
A. Generally, this Policy applies to all City records and to records requested
pursuant to CORA.
B. This Policy does not apply to informal requests for information. Official
records custodians will make reasonable efforts to respond to informal
requests for information as soon as practicable. Such requests are not
required to be made in writing or on City forms.
C. This Policy does not apply to criminal justice records, as defined by the
Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act (CCJRA), C.R.S. §§ 24-72-301 et seq.
Requests for criminal justice records will be forwarded to the appropriate City
criminal justice agency for processing.

City of Boulder Policies and Procedures
Access to Public Records (CORA)
Revised July 2024
Page 2 of 9

IV.

DEFINITIONS

B. “Applicant” means the person requesting to inspect or receive public records
from the City.
V.

OFFICIAL RECORDS CUSTODIANS
A. Official custodians for City records are as follows:
1. The City Clerk is the official custodian of all records that are centrally
maintained by the City, including electronic communications.
2. Department heads are the official custodians of all records maintained
within their departments.
B. It is the responsibility of all official records custodians to become familiar with,
and educate affected City employees about, the requirements and
procedures contained in this Policy.

VI.

PROCEDURES
A. Written Requests. Generally, requests for public records under this Policy
must be made in writing and be specific as to the information requested. The
City will treat a records request that cites the federal Freedom of Information
Act as though it were made pursuant to CORA. If an Applicant is uncertain
about the identity of the official records custodian for the requested records,
the Applicant may direct the request to the City Clerk or the Central Records
department.
B. Identification of Applicant. Except when a record is confidential and
accessible to only the Applicant on the basis that the Applicant is the person
in interest, as that term is defined under CORA, the City will not require an
Applicant to furnish any form of identification as a prerequisite to releasing
public records.
C. Notifications to City Departments.
1. City staff must promptly notify the City Attorney’s Office and Central
Records of all records requests so they may assist in processing such
requests. The City Attorney’s Office may advise City staff about matters
related to confidentiality, privileged records, and related matters prior to
records being released to the Applicant.
2. Requests from the news media shall be directed to the City Manager’s
Office communications staff, with a copy to Central Records and the City
Attorney’s Office.

Attachment: City of Boulder (5077 : Records Request Fee Waivers for Members of the Media)

A. The definitions found in C.R.S. § 24-72-202, as amended from time to time,
shall apply to this Policy unless the context clearly requires a different
meaning.

1.5.6.c
City of Boulder Policies and Procedures
Access to Public Records (CORA)
Revised July 2024
Page 3 of 9

E. Cost Estimate. A cost estimate will be provided to the Applicant if the
estimated time needed to process the records request exceeds one hour. The
cost estimate will include the estimated time needed by any City staff or
representative to complete the research, retrieval, copying, redaction,
assembly, etc., of the requested public records. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure of the City to provide a cost estimate to the Applicant
does not relieve the Applicant of the obligation to pay for the cost to the City
of producing public records in response to the Applicant’s request and does
not prohibit the City from requiring payment prior to the City’s release of such
records. Fees applicable to records requests are set forth in Section VIII
below.
F. Advance Deposit. If the estimated time to process a records request
exceeds one hour, the City will require the Applicant to pay a deposit equal to
one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost to produce the records.
Should production of the records prove more costly than provided in the
estimate, the Applicant must pay the additional amount prior to receiving the
records. However, if the actual costs to the City are less than the estimate,
any necessary cost adjustment and refund will be made by the City at the
time the records are provided to the Applicant.
G. Tolling of Response Time. If the estimated time to process a records
request exceeds an hour, no work to complete the request will begin until the
Applicant approves the cost estimate and pays the deposit. The timeframe
the City has to complete the request will be tolled during the time period
between notification of the cost estimate to the Applicant, Applicant’s
approval of such estimate, and Applicant’s submittal of the deposit.
H. Response Time.
1. Pursuant to CORA, the City shall make public records available within
three (3) business days of the City’s receipt of the request unless
extenuating circumstances exist. If extenuating circumstances exist, the
City will notify the Applicant in writing and will have up to an additional
seven (7) business days to make the requested records available.
2. If a request is received after 2:00 P.M. on a regular business day of the
City or outside of regular City business hours, the request will be
considered received on the next business day.
3. If the nature of the request requires more time than set out under CORA,
the City will make a good faith, reasonable effort to process the request as
promptly as is feasible in light of the size and scope of the request, the
workload of the City employees needed to respond to the request, and the
technical capacity of the City’s information technology (IT) systems.

Packet Pg. 74

Attachment: City of Boulder (5077 : Records Request Fee Waivers for Members of the Media)

D. Conferral with Applicant. The City may contact the Applicant in order to
clarify or narrow the request.

I.

Format and Manipulation of Data.

2. The City is not required to create a new public record in response to a
records request. In the event that the City consents to any manipulation of
data, the Applicant will be charged in accordance with the fees set forth in
Section VIII below.
J. Duplication of Records. The City will not screen requests from the same
Applicant to avoid duplication of records. In the event that duplicate records
are produced, no refunds will be issued.
K. Multiple Submissions. Multiple or serial requests from the same Applicant
within the timespan of three (3) consecutive business days will be considered
a single request for purposes of charging fees to the Applicant.
L. Abandoned Requests. If the City attempts to contact an Applicant to clarify a
request, discuss the scope of a request, and/or provide a cost estimate and
the Applicant does not respond within ten (10) business days, the City will
close the request and require the Applicant to submit a new records request.
M. Abusive or Harassing Requests. While the City is required to make a
reasonable, good faith effort to respond to records requests within the
guidelines of CORA, the City is not required to, and will not, respond to
harassing, demeaning, threatening, or abusive communications. Persistent
communications from an Applicant that contain harassing, demeaning,
threatening, or abusive communications may be reported to the Boulder
Police Department.
N. Posting of Public Records. Following the production of public records in
response to a records request and unless such records are confidential or
available only to the Applicant, the City may post such records in a publicly
available location on its website to be accessible free of charge. The cost of
production of such public records shall be borne by the initial Applicant.
O. Use of City Computers. No Applicant shall be allowed to access a computer
terminal connected to internal City computer systems that is not ordinarily
available for general public use.
VII.

ACCESS DENIED
A. The City may deny a request for any of the reasons outlined in C.R.S. § 2472-204. For a list of the types of records that the City may withhold, refer to
that section of CORA. Laws other than CORA may govern the City’s release
of certain records or information.

extensive staff time.
PUBLIC ACCESS TO SOLICITATION RECORDS
A. Pursuant to C.R.S. § 24-101-105(2), all political subdivisions of the State of
Colorado may adopt all or a portion of the state’s procurement code, which is
codified at Title 24, Articles 101-112, C.R.S., and its accompanying rules (State
Procurement Code).
B. The City finds that adoption of the policies for public access to solicitation
records, including market research, in the State Procurement Code and of the
supplemental policies for related City-specific solicitation practices set forth in
this Section IX foster effective competition, result in increased economy in the
City’s procurement activities, and prevent the unnecessary interference with the
regular discharge of the City’s procurement duties. 1
C. The City hereby adopts the following policies concerning release of solicitation
records:
1. Access to Records Before and After Award.
a. Following the closing time and date for the submission of solicitation
responses and prior to award of a contract, the names of the bidders
or offerors (“Respondents”) shall be made available for inspection,
upon request. For solicitations where the award is based on the lowest
bid or where price is the primary consideration, the amount of each bid
or proposal shall be included with the name of the Respondent. For
solicitations where the award is based on factors other than the lowest
bid or where price is not the primary consideration, the amount of each
bid or proposal shall not be made available prior to award. In no event
shall a solicitation response be made available publicly prior to
award. 2
b. After award of a solicitation, all documentation related to the
solicitation, including Respondent responses, shall be open to public
inspection, except to the extent the City has approved a request from
a Respondent to classify certain portions of the response as trade
secrets or other confidential or proprietary information. 3
c. The rules applicable to the disclosure of information prior to and after
an award and the process for determining if certain information is

1 See C.R.S. § 24-72-203(1)(a) (“…[T]he official custodian of any public records may make such rules with reference

to the inspection of such records as are reasonably necessary for the protection of such records and the prevention of
unnecessary interference with the regular discharge of the duties of the custodian or the custodian’s office.”)

d. An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or any other solicitation
may be canceled or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in
whole or in part at any time before a contract is executed when it is in
the best interests of the City. The reasons therefor shall be made part
of the contract file but shall remain confidential and shall not be
subject to the provisions of CORA for the lesser of six months or until
the contract at issue is awarded. 5
e. All responses to requests for information are confidential until after an
award, based on a subsequent solicitation, has been made or until the
City determines that it will not pursue a subsequent solicitation based
on the request for information. After such time, the responses to a
request for information shall be open to public inspection in
accordance with the provisions of CORA. 6
f.

Subsection IX.C.1.e shall apply to requests for qualifications in
addition to requests for information.

g. Except as provided in Subsections IX.C.1.e and IX.C.1.f above,
proposals and bids shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of the
contents of the proposal or bid to competing Respondents during the
review process. A register of proposals and bids shall be prepared in
accordance with rules and such procurement records shall be open for
public inspection after the award as provided in CORA. 7
h. As provided in a request for proposals and pursuant to any applicable
City rules, discussions may be conducted with responsible
Respondents who submit proposals determined to be reasonably
susceptible of being selected for an award for the purpose of
clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the
solicitation requirements. Respondents shall be accorded fair and
equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and
revision of proposals, and such revisions may be permitted after
submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and
final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of
any information derived from proposals submitted by competing
Respondents. 8

a. A Respondent may submit, as a part of its solicitation response, a
written request for classification of certain portions of the response as
trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information. Material
for which confidentiality has been requested shall be readily
identifiable and separable from other portions of the solicitation to
facilitate public inspection of the non-confidential portion of the
solicitation response. In no event shall an entire solicitation response
be classified as confidential. 9
b. If the City receives a records request for or involving solicitation
records, the City may, but is not required to, contact the Respondent
before producing records pursuant to the records request, to request
that the Respondent identify any information in its solicitation
documents that is confidential or proprietary under CORA. Any part of
a solicitation response not clearly marked as confidential or proprietary
when the solicitation response is submitted to the City is presumed to
be a public record.
c. If at any time the Respondent identifies information to be withheld from
release to the public, the Respondent will be required to indemnify the
City and its officers and employees, through a written agreement in a
form approved by the City Attorney’s Office, from and against all
attorney fees and costs, incurred by or awarded against the City in
connection with any litigation brought under C.R.S. § 24-72-204(5)
challenging the City’s denial of inspection, copying, or release of the
information identified as proprietary or confidential by the Respondent.
X.

INTERPRETATION, AMENDMENTS, AND PUBLICATION
A. Employees who have questions concerning the interpretation or application of
this Policy should be directed to the City Attorney’s Office.
B. This Policy supersedes all previous policies covering the same or similar topics.
Exceptions to this Policy may be granted only by the City Manager. This Policy
may be reviewed and changed at any time.
C. The City Clerk shall publish this Policy by posting and maintaining it on the City’s
website.

City of Fort Collins
Public Records Requests Policy
Purpose.
This policy sets forth the City’s rules regarding the inspection of public records as
required by the Colorado Open Records Act, C.R.S. § 24-72-200.1, et seq.
(“CORA”). These rules are reasonably necessary for the protection of the public
records and the prevention of unnecessary interference with the regular discharge of
the duties of the custodian or the custodian’s office. This policy is not applicable to
criminal justice records.1 Those records are governed by separate statutes and
policies.
Public record means all writings made, maintained, or kept by the City of Fort Collins,
Colorado (City) and related entities for use in the exercise of functions required or
authorized by law or administrative rule or involving the receipt or expenditure of public
2

funds.

Custodian means and includes any City of Fort Collins employee who is responsible for
the maintenance, care, and keeping of public records, regardless of whether the records
are in his or her actual personal custody and control. 3
Records Coordinator means the City Clerk or their designee. The Records Coordinator is
responsible for processing and responding to CORA requests submitted to the City.
The custodian will apply the provisions of CORA to determine what records are
public and subject to public disclosure pursuant to a request. Not all records are
subject to disclosure and the records coordinator will notify the requestor when and
why requested records will not be disclosed as required by CORA.
Many City records are available on its website at Public Records such as financial
documents, City Council agendas, minutes, and the Municipal Code and City Charter.
If the records that are the subject of a request are available publicly (i.e., on the City
website), the City Clerk may direct the requestor to such source for inspection of the
records.

_____________________________

Records qualifying as criminal justice records under the Colorado Criminal Justice
Records Act, CRS § 24-72- 301, et seq., are not subject to this policy and must be
submitted directly to the Police Department.

2.

Form of Requests.

All requests must specifically identify the records requested. Written requests may be
made in email format or submitted to the City Clerk’s office via the Public Records
Portal/JustFOIA: https://fortcollinsco.justfoia.com/publicportal/home/track
The requestor of the records should provide valid contact information, including a
telephone number and e-mail address. This contact information may be used to
provide information and if the custodian needs to confer with a requesting party.
3.

Notice about email retention.
Pursuant to the City's Electronic Records Retention policy, [2.02], messages are
automatically deleted from the City’s email system after 90 days for messages in Deleted
or Junk/Spam folders and after 730 days (two years) for inboxes and all other email
folders. Upon receipt of a request for email communications, the Records Coordinator
will work with the City’s Information Technology (“IT”) department on the request.

4.

Timeframe for Responding to Requests.
Upon receipt of a complete request and payment of any applicable fees to the Records
Coordinator as described in Section 7, the City will make public records available for
inspection and copying within a reasonable time. Subject to Section 6, unless the
requesting party agrees to a longer time, a reasonable time will be within three working
days of either the date of the written request or the payment of the estimated fees if
advance payment is required.
Review period for physical records. The Records Coordinator will inform the requester
about the availability of original physical copies that need to be examined or retrieved at
the designated City Department and cannot be generated electronically. This also applies
to cases where the requester has specifically asked for physical copies. If these records
are located in the City Clerk's office, they will be accessible for ten business days
following the notice provided by the Records Coordinator. For other departments, specific
timelines for review will be determined upon consultation.
If the requester does not review the physical records provided for inspection or retrieval
within ten business days, the request will be considered abandoned. At this point, any
original records will be returned to their usual location, and any copies will be destroyed.

Closing Abandoned Requests. The City will deem an open records request abandoned if,

Attachment: Fort Collins (5077 : Records Request Fee Waivers for Members of the Media)

Requests for inspection of records that can be quickly identified and are readily
available by the custodian for immediate inspection may be made orally, however,
the Custodian reserves the right to require that a request be submitted in writing.

after three business days:
•
•

The requester did not provide a clarifying response to questions from the
Records Coordinator, or
Did not submit payment for the applicable fees outlined in Section 7 below.

5.

Limitations on Requests.
The following are limitations on the form and frequency of requests necessary to manage
the burden on taxpayer resources and to limit substantial interference in the regular
discharge of the duties of the Records Coordinator and the responding City departments.
A.
The City will not allow the inspection of any records if such inspection would be
contrary to state or federal law or regulation, would violate a court order, or as permissible
under CORA.
B.
In compliance with CORA, the City will not allow inspection of any privileged,
confidential legal records and will not log or identify individual records of this type,
except as required by CORA.
C.
Requests for inspection from attorneys related to pending legal matters involving
the City must be directed to the City Attorney’s Office.
D.
All requests must include enough information so the record(s) being requested can
be identified, including a date or date range. Without sufficient information to search and
identify the records being requested, the request may be deemed incomplete until
requested clarification has been provided. As stated above, the request will be deemed
abandoned and closed if the requestor does not provide clarification within three business
days of the Records Coordinator requesting clarification.
E.
Due to the extraordinary number of email communications generated by City
business, all requests for email records should include a date range and keywords that the
City may use to search and locate requested records. When possible, the sending and
receiving party to the email should be listed in the request. As stated above, the request
will be deemed abandoned and closed if the requestor does not provide clarification within
three business days of the Records Coordinator requesting clarification.
F.
A general request for information rather than a request for specific documents may
be deemed incomplete until requested clarification has been provided. As stated above,
the request will be deemed abandoned and closed if the requestor does not provide
clarification within three business days of the Records Coordinator requesting
clarification. If a record does not already exist, there is no requirement under CORA for
an agency to create a new record to fulfill a public records request.
3
Packet Pg. 83

Attachment: Fort Collins (5077 : Records Request Fee Waivers for Members of the Media)

At such time, the request will be closed, and the requestor must submit a new request if
they wish to continue their request at a later date.

H.
Multiple records requests within a week may be answered in the order that they
were received.
I.

6.

In certain circumstances a single point of contact may be designated for specified
individuals or organizations making records requests. In such circumstances, the
individual or organization shall be notified that future records requests must be sent to the
single point of contact. Once notified, records requests from the individual or
organization are not deemed received by the City until received by the single point of
contact. The designation of a single point of contact will not modify other provisions of
this policy and the single point of contact will act as the Records Coordinator’s designee.
The circumstances for designation of a single point of contact include, but are not limited
to:
(i)

If an individual or organization has been harassing, threatening, or
demonstrated otherwise inappropriate conduct to City employees, or is
presenting a safety risk to City employees; or

(ii)

If the request requires specialized technical knowledge or expertise.

Extended Time Frame for Responses.
A.
While a reasonable time to respond is presumed to be three business days, some
requests or combinations of requests may trigger an extended period for the City to
respond. If a request falls within the circumstances described in Section 24-72-203(3),
C.R.S., the City may require additional time to respond (up to seven days).
B.
It may not be possible to provide the requested records for inspection or copying
within the period specified above because:
(i) the records were not clearly identified by the requesting party;
(ii) the request was very broad, and/or
(iii) earlier compliance would substantially interfere with the regular discharge
of the duties of the custodian or the custodian’s department.
Within the initial three business days of receipt of a complete request, the Records
Coordinator will inform the requesting party in writing of the expected time frame
for the response and the reasons for the delay.
C.

The City will make reasonable efforts to comply with all records requests and time

G.
Upon the third request for the same or substantially the same records, with the
sameness of the request being determined in the Records Coordinator’s reasonable
discretion, the Records Coordinator may require the requesting party to state in writing
the reason(s) for any additional request and/or how an additional request is not the same
or similar to prior requests. Absent such written clarification, the Records Coordinator
may close the request as previously completed.

frames articulated in CORA, in light of the specific circumstances, in the event of a
declared local emergency or other significant unforeseen event.
7.

Fees.

(i)

in the judgment of the custodian, the nature of the request makes it
necessary to spend more than 60 minutes of staff time to (a) research
and retrieve the requested records to ensure that the records are
properly identified as being responsive to the request and are made
available for inspection, and (b) review the requested records for
withholding or redaction because of privilege as required or permitted
by CORA.

B.
Fee Amounts. The following hourly fees will be charged for the time necessary to
accomplish those tasks:
(i)

8.

$33.58 per hour after the first 60 minutes of combined time spent on
research and retrieval, identification, segregation, and/or
redaction of records associated with a privilege review to
determine whether a record may or may not need to be disclosed or
redacted -- [pursuant to C.R.S. Section 24-72-204(6)(a)];

Copying Costs.
A.
Copying. If physical copies of public records are requested or copying is
necessary, the following copying fees will be charged in addition to any other applicable
fees:
(i)
(ii)

up to 11” x 14” - $.25 per copy;
11” x 17” - $.50 per copy.

For copies of other sizes, fee amounts will be set by the department
making the copies but shall not exceed actual cost.
At its discretion, the City may send copying to an outside vendor, in which
case the requesting party will be charged the vendor’s charge, not to exceed
the actual cost or the above noted applicable fees.
B.
Placement on Electronic Storage Devices. The following fees will be charged for
providing records on storage devices if the custodian department has the ability to copy the
records to the device:
(i)

CD/DVD-Rom – actual cost of acquiring the CD/DVD

1.5.6.d

USB flash drive - actual cost of acquiring the USB flash drive
(ii)

other portable digital storage devices - actual cost of acquiring the device

D.
Email Transmission of Records. No fee will be charged for the transmission of
records by electronic mail, although the other fees described in this policy may be
applicable if the services for which those fees are charged are necessary in order to place
the records into a format that can be transmitted electronically.
E.
Payment of Estimated Fees Required Prior to Identification, Retrieval, Review and
Copying of Records as follows:
(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

If the custodian estimates that the fees for researching, retrieving, reviewing,
manipulating, segregating, redacting, and copying the requested records will
be $50 or more, the custodian will notify the requestor of the estimated amount
and may not begin those tasks until the estimated fees are paid.
The custodian will provide the fee estimate notice to the requester as soon as
it becomes apparent to the custodian that payment of the estimated fees will
be necessary pursuant to this Section.
The date of payment of the estimated fees will begin the period of time within
which the records must be made available for inspection under the applicable
timeframe as explained in Section 4, above.
If in the course of the retrieval or review process, the custodian discovers a
circumstance that results in a significantly greater estimate of the amount of
fees, the custodian will provide the new estimate to the requesting party and
the process will be paused until the new fee estimate amount is paid.
Once the actual amount of the fees is known, the requesting party will be
refunded any excess amount collected or will be required to pay any additional
amount owed prior to obtaining access to the records, as applicable.

F.
The City will not proceed with a new request from a requestor who has not paid all
costs associated with a previous request until those prior fees are paid.
G.
Fees may, at the discretion of the City Manager or their designee, be reduced or
waived if the records and services are to be used for a public purpose. The specific public
purpose must be identified in the request.
9.

Security of Record.
The original public record to be inspected shall not be released to the requestor. The
record custodian may take precautions to ensure the security of the record and the
Records Coordinator will notify the requestor of those precautions.

1.5.6.d

10.

Digital Records.

In addition, the custodian does not have to produce the file in a digital searchable or
sortable format if the custodian has determined after a reasonable inquiry that it is not
technologically or practically feasible to do so because:
(i) It would be too difficult to remove information that must be legally withheld, such
as medical information;
(ii) Providing a copy of the record in a digital searchable or sortable format of the
record is simply not feasible; or
(iii) In order to provide a digital copy of the searchable or sortable file, additional
software would need to be purchased or additional programming or functionality
in existing software would need to be created in order to remove information the
custodian is legally required or allowed to withhold.
11.

Dispute Resolution.
If a custodian denies a records request and the requester objects, the requester must give
notice to the Records Coordinator in writing they plan to apply for judicial review.
Before the requester can file a lawsuit, the request must wait fourteen days from the date
of the notice. During that time, the Records Coordinator must either meet with the
requester in person or speak to them over the phone to attempt to resolve the dispute
without the need for judicial review. The Records Coordinator will make reasonable
efforts to contact the requesting party to discuss the matter.

12.

Documents Subject to Copyright – Proprietary Information
If producing a file for the requester in a searchable or sortable format would violate the
terms of any copyright or licensing agreement between the City and a third party or
cause a third party’s proprietary information to be released, the custodian is not required
to provide the record in a searchable or sortable format.
Certain documents requested pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act are also
governed by 17 U.S.C. 107. This federal law requires that prior to releasing any
copyrighted information, the City verify that the purpose for which the request is made
is considered a “Fair Use.” “Fair Use” is defined as reproduction in copies or

Records that the City keeps in digital format are subject to specific requirements as to
how those records should be provided to a requesting party. The City is not required to
create a new document to respond to a request for information. When a public record
is available in a digital format, the City will transmit a digital copy to the requester by
either e-mail or via the City’s records request application JustFOIA. The City’s default
method of transmission is through the JustFOIA records request system.

criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom
use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining
whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be
considered shall include—
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
To ensure compliance with 17 USC 107, the City will ask requestors of copyrighted
information to fill out a separate form attesting to the above. (Form attached).

This document outlines how University of Colorado Hospital Authority will apply the Colorado Open
Records Act (“CORA”) with respect to “public records” as defined in Colorado Revised Statutes § 23-21510. This policy is meant to inform the public and guide staff, and applies to every request for public
records filed under CORA for which University of Colorado Hospital Authority is the custodian.
I.

Records Requests and Timing of Response
a. All requests to inspect public records must be made in writing to the University of
Colorado Health Chief Legal Officer (“CLO”) or that person’s designee (the “CORA
Officer”). Requests made to any other person will not be accepted.
b. Requests may be submitted via electronic email to Jacki.Melmed@uchealth.org, or to
12401 E. 17th Avenue, Mail Stop F-415, Aurora, Colorado, 80045.
c. University of Colorado Hospital Authority staff that receives requests made pursuant to
CORA must promptly contact the UCHealth Legal Department when received.
d. The date that the CORA Officer receives the request will be considered the “date of
receipt,” except with respect to requests submitted via email, which will be considered
received on the date the CORA Officer confirms receipt in writing to the requestor.
University of Colorado Hospital Authority will respond to requests for records within a
reasonable time as set forth in C.R.S. § 24-72-203(3)(b), unless extenuating
circumstances exist such that it will require additional time to comply with the request.
e. The statutory time for response will begin on the date that the CORA Officer receives
the request, except in the case of a submission via email, in which case the statutory
time for response will begin when the CORA Officer acknowledges receipt in writing to
the requestor. Any non-emailed request received after 2:00 p.m. or any day that the
state of Colorado recognizes as a holiday will be considered received on the following
business day.
f. All requests for records must be specific and include relevant dates. Any request that is
vague or overbroad may require the CORA Officer to request additional information
from the requestor.

II.

Records Subject to CORA
a. Only records identified in C.R.S. § 23-21-510 are “public records” subject to CORA’s
requirements. Those records are:
i. The book of resolutions, orders, other proceedings of the University of Colorado
Hospital Authority board of directors (“Board of Directors”),
ii. Minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors;
iii. Annual reports and monthly financial statements given to the Board of
Directors;
iv. Certificates, contracts and any financial agreements, and bonds given by
officers, employees, and any other agents of the University of Colorado Hospital
Authority;
v. Any personnel reports, guidelines, manuals, handbooks, other than individual
personnel files; and
vi. The account of all money received by and disbursed on behalf of University of
Colorado Hospital Authority.
b. All writings and other records concerning the modification, initiation, or cessation of
patient care programs shall not be deemed to be a public record if premature disclosure

1.5.6.f

III.

Records Not Subject to CORA
a. Any record that is not specifically identified in C.R.S. § 23-21-510 is not considered a
public record subject to CORA.
b. Any records for which an applicable state or federal law limits disclosure (including but
not limited to HIPAA and applicable federal and state privacy laws) are not considered
public records subject to CORA.

IV.

Fees for Production
a. To cover the cost of processing a CORA request, University of Colorado Hospital
Authority may charge for the time spent to research and respond to requests.
i. A research and retrieval fee based on the actual time spent by employees to
locate and produce the requested documents may be charged at the maximum
fee permitted by C.R.S. § 24-72-205, which automatically adjusts for inflation. As
of June 21, 2019, that maximum hourly charge is $33.53. There is no charge for
the first hour to research and retrieve records.
ii. The production of any document that requires copying will be charged at:
1. $0.25 per standard page for a copy of a record
2. The actual cost of copying non-standard copies, including any records
that are produced on disc or in any other electronic format.
iii. If electronic records of requested documents exist and can be produced without
printing or scanning, there will be no charge for providing such records if it can
be done in an electronic format if there is no cost to the University of Colorado
Hospital Authority (i.e. email).
b. If University of Colorado Hospital Authority anticipates that producing the requested
documents will exceed the initial hour of an employee’s time, the CORA Officer will
provide the requestor with a good-faith estimate of the cost of responding. If after
receiving the estimate the requestor wishes to proceed, the requestor must provide
written confirmation of the estimate and desire to proceed in writing, and must pre-pay
the estimated cost for research, retrieval, and production. The period of time between
the estimate and the date the CORA Officer receives written authorization to proceed
will not count against the statutory time period for production. Any pre-payment that
exceeds the charge actually incurred will be refunded.
c. If a requestor wishes to personally inspect the documents prior to receiving copies, the
inspection will be conducted by appointment during normal business hours. The
requestor may be charged for an employee’s time spent in conjunction with an
inspection.
d. University of Colorado Hospital Authority may, without creating any enforceable right,
waive the fee in its sole discretion.
e. University of Colorado Hospital Authority may set a fee for productions that are
produced through the manipulation of data.

V.

Document Format
a. Documents may be available in their native format if they do not need to be redacted or
if they can be readily accessed.

of information contained in such writings or other records would give an unfair
competitive or bargaining advantage to any person or entity.

b. Documents such as databases or spreadsheets that can be sorted or searched will be
available in a similar format.
c. University of Colorado Hospital Authority will not provide documents in a format that
requires providing software or that would violate the terms of any agreement or rights
held by a third party, such as licensing agreements or copyrights.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A Refinancing

February 11, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to adopt the attached Resolution Number ____ (the “COP Resolution”),
Series of 2025 authorizing the refinancing of Certificate of Participation (COP) Series 2015A.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD primarily utilizes sales tax bonds and certificates of participation (COPs), when necessary, as
financing mechanisms to provide funding for certain purchases of assets with useful lives in excess of
one year. Sales tax bonds are subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitations and debt service
payments are secured by future collections of sales and use taxes. COPs are lease-purchase
arrangements and are not subject to TABOR limitations, however, COPs require annual appropriation by
the Board through the budgeting process to authorize annual principal and interest payments. COPs are
secured through collateralization of essential assets of the district. Bonds and COPs are referred to as
RTD debt for discussion purposes.
All of RTD’s debt has fixed interest rates, meaning that the interest rate paid on the portfolio of debt
does not vary with market changes. In addition, RTD’s debt has fixed terms of maturity and is not
subject to acceleration meaning that all debt payments will occur on a fixed schedule through the term
of each obligation. These features provide budget certainty as well as limit RTD’s interest rate risk.
RTD’s debt portfolio contains obligations that are either tax-exempt or taxable. Taxable debt results in
interest payments to debt holders being subject to income tax while tax-exempt debt is generally nontaxable. Taxable debt generally has a higher cost to RTD than tax-exempt debt due to the difference in
interest rates at the time of issuance. Taxable debt is issued instead of tax-exempt debt in situations
that are advantageous to RTD but do not meet the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements to be
issued as tax-exempt.
As of December 31, 2024, RTD’s total outstanding bonds and COPs totaled $2.804 billion.

Packet Pg. 99

2.16.A

In addition, RTD has other long-term obligations associated with the Eagle Public Private Partnership
(P3), which is the design, build, finance, operate and maintain concessionaire agreement entered with
Denver Transit Partners/Operators for the A, B and G Commuter Rail Lines and the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF), totaling $0.510 billion.
DISCUSSION
RTD and its Municipal Advisor, Hilltop Securities, constantly monitor market conditions for opportunities
for efficiencies regarding RTD’s finances. Current market conditions for debt have created an opportunity
to lower future interest expense.
RTD generally issues tax-exempt debt with 10-year call provisions to provide future flexibility for which
refinancing is permitted at the call date. Current IRS regulations do not permit advance refinancing (prior
to the call date) of tax-exempt debt obligations unless more expensive taxable debt is used.
The Series 2015A COPs were issued for equipment purchases, including light rail vehicles, mall shuttles,
60-foot articulated buses and 40-foot buses. These COPs are eligible for refinancing and current market
conditions indicate that refinancing for interest savings would generate savings of approximately $15.4
million through 2040. These savings are equivalent to net present value (NPV) savings of $4.1 million or
3.84%.
The attached Resolution allows the issuance of Certificates of Participation, Series 2025 to refinance the

million through 2040 or $4.1 million or 3.84% on an NPV basis. This equates to cash flow savings of
more than $900,000 annually through 2040.

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease, the Indenture or the 2025 Certificates shall be construed as creating or constituting a
-5\\4143-8973-4485 v4

Packet Pg. 106

general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or
requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year.
The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2025 Certificates
except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals and certain other payments under the
Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in accordance with the provisions of
the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2025 Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or
requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or
constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year
financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt
limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other
financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the 2025 Certificates shall be
construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of governmental powers nor as a
donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of
Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the 2025 Certificates shall
directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and
appropriated for the District's then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2025 Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2025 Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2025 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2025 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the
General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding
Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the
Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of
the District its option to purchase all of the 2015A Leased Property currently encumbered under
the 2015A Indenture and to redeem all of the outstanding 2015A Certificates (the "Refunded
Certificates"), as applicable, on the redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the
Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate
related to the Refunding Project, the District hereby irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give
notice of refunding and defeasance to the owners of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with
the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the Indenture of Trust related to the Refunded Certificates
and the Escrow Agreement between the Corporation and the Trustee, as escrow agent, related to
the Refunded Certificates.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2025 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or

Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or

hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2025 Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2025 Leased Property to the District under the conditions

BACKGROUND
RTD is a direct recipient of federal grant funding from the FTA. Eligibility for being a direct recipient of
federal funding requires certain qualifications, certifications, registrations, and authorizations granted by
the FTA. Application, expenditure, and receipt of federal grant funding is subject to several compliance
and reporting requirements as well as regular engagement and coordination with the FTA Region 8
Office.
RTD has internal policies and procedures for applying for grant opportunities regarding planned activities.
Therefore, the agency is strategic in its approach to considering and pursuing grant funding.
On December 6, 2024, RTD received notification from the FTA that certain enhancements will be
required for recipients to apply for and continue receiving FTA funding effective March 5, 2025. These
enhancements include:
•
•

Opinion of Counsel: Each recipient must be legally empowered to carry out the activities specified
in the award
Authorizing Resolution: Each recipient organization must have a resolution or equivalent, from the
recipient’s Board of Directors or equivalent Authorizing Official, to be responsible for applying for
assistance and legally committing the applicant or recipient to compliance with terms of an award

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.

Dear Colleague:
FTA is pleased to announce the release of a recent enhancement in TrAMS, FTA’s grants
management system of record, specific to the organization and labeling of recipient documents.
As you are aware, one of the prerequisites to be a recipient of FTA funding is demonstrating
legal capacity to carry out the project(s) included in federal assistance awards. This is generally
based on the review of the recipient organization’s documentation and certification that it has the
legal capacity to carry out FTA-funded programs and projects. Specifically, the recipient must be
eligible and authorized under state or local law to request, receive, and spend FTA funds to
administer FTA-assisted projects.
•

Opinion of Counsel: Each recipient must be legally empowered to carry out the
activities specified in the award.

•

Authorizing Resolution: Each recipient organization must have a resolution or
equivalent, from the recipient’s Board of Directors or equivalent Authorizing Official, to
be responsible for applying for assistance and legally committing the applicant or
recipient to compliance with terms of an award.

This enhancement provides updated document labels within the Recipient Document profile
module for these two required documents, as well as includes an enhanced search functionality
for all users to find important documents that may be uploaded in their profile. In an effort to
assist with the rollout of this enhancement, TrAMS has attempted to proactively label any
documents that were named using these terms for the recipient. However, all recipients are
asked to review and confirm that the correct document was properly labeled by the system.
Additionally, if the system was unable to locate a document labeled using these terms, recipients
must locate and properly identify both documents within their Recipient profile.
Beginning March 5, 2025, TrAMS will prevent any recipients that have not properly identified
the Opinion of Counsel and Authorizing Resolution in their Recipient Document profile from
transmitting or submitting new applications unless they have correctly labeled and/or uploaded
their required legal documents.

Once your organization has been selected, next click on Related Actions and select the Recipient
Documents field. Finally confirm or upload each document using the Opinion of Counsel and

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Light Rail Vehicle Cameras Retrofit

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Confluence Security for the purchase and installation of forward-facing, operator-facing incab, and customer compartment cameras on 157 light rail vehicles for a total cost not to exceed
$3,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 674, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
has delegated its safety oversight responsibilities to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC),
which is the State Safety Oversight (SSO) agency responsible for the oversight of safety and security of
rail fixed guideway systems within the state of Colorado.
Effective June 30, 2022, pursuant to CPUC Rule 7349(b), as a Rail Transit Agency (RTA), RTD was
required to use cameras currently installed in its light rail vehicles (LRVs) to record activity at all times
when the light rail vehicle power is on. This footage must be used to assist in the management of safe
light rail operations, including in accident investigations, whether performed by CPUC staff or the RTA.
Rule 7349(b) also requires that no later than June 30, 2027, RTAs must install and use forward-facing
and operator-facing in-cab cameras on all LRVs for the above purposes.
DISCUSSION
On November 7, 2024, RTD issued a solicitation for LRV cameras and camera installation to replace
existing cameras. The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and advertised on RTD’s
online procurement portal. Proposals were due December 20, 2024. Two proposals were received during
the solicitation period. A panel of subject-matter experts assessed the proposals using pre-determined
objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the proposals, the panel recommends
awarding the contract to Confluence Security.
This recommended action aligns with 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by improving the agency’s ability to investigate events,
accidents, and criminal incidents and to increase public and employee safety and security on LRVs.

Packet Pg. 132

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the 2025 Budget for the provision of replacing existing cameras with forwardfacing and operator-facing in-cab cameras in LRVs.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Access-on-Demand Funding

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to provide
additional funding of $15,814,441 for the Access-on-Demand program, raising the not-to-exceed
amount from $21.9 to $37.8 million, and delegating authority to amend the contracts with existing
providers to increase the current amount of program funding for the remainder of the term of the
contracts, which expire December 31, 2025.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Paul Hamilton, Director, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD and its contractor partners deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,345 square-mile service
area, which services include bus, light rail, commuter rail, and micro transit services, as well as Accessa-Ride complementary paratransit services in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
In November 2020, RTD launched its Access-on-Demand service as part of an expanded premium to
Access-a-Ride paratransit service. Access-on-Demand began as a supplemental demand-response pilot
program in partnership with Uber, a private transportation network company (TNC). The program’s goal
was to provide a responsive, on-demand platform for paratransit customers, which was similar to the
agency’s Access-a-Cab program as it existed at that time. The Access-a-Cab program provided
alternative on-demand service to paratransit customers through private taxicab providers.
The Access-on-Demand pilot program provided eligible customers a per-trip subsidy of up to $20, and
those customers were required to pay the first $2 in fare for each trip. Access-a-Ride customers within
four ZIP codes, selected for their density of existing paratransit customers, were eligible to participate in
this pilot. The program hours were between 6 and 9 a.m. and between 2 and 5 p.m. The program was
later expanded to an additional three ZIP codes and was expanded again to serve customers 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. During the pilot period, RTD continued to offer its Access-a-Cab demandresponse service, for which a $12 subsidy was offered, and customers were required to pay $2 in fare
for each trip.

Packet Pg. 138

2.17.F

Following the Board’s approval of funding in November 2022 in the amount of approximately $9.3
million, in January 2023, RTD merged the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Cab programs. Since then,
RTD has partnered with four contracted private providers, Uber, Lyft, Metro Taxi, and zTrip, to provide
Access-on-Demand service. Customers travel using their choice of these providers, receive a subsidy of
up to $25 per trip, and pay no upfront fare. Additionally, customers schedule trips through the four
providers’ mobile apps or the RTD Access-a-Ride call center for Metro Taxi or zTrip. Customers are
limited to 60 one-way trips per month across all providers and are responsible for monitoring their trip
usage.
Due to the popularity of Access-on-Demand as an alternative to traditional paratransit services, demand
for service quickly exceeded expectations following the expansion beyond the pilot program in January
2023. Key factors driving the increase in demand likely include the same-day convenience when booking
an Access-on-Demand trip, expanded service times and service area when compared with Access-aRide, and no out-of-pocket cost to customers. As a result, RTD anticipates that Access-on-Demand trip
cost subsidies for calendar year 2024 will reach $11.1 million, a 77 percent increase over subsidy costs
in 2023 (at the time of this report development all third-party costs for 2024 have yet to be reconciled).
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery. This on-site review was
conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in a holistic
review of the paratransit program, including both the Access-on-Demand program and the Access-a-Ride
program. Peer review recommendations, coupled with paratransit customer feedback, will assist RTD in
adopting industry best practices, understanding the agency’s strengths and opportunities concerning
paratransit service delivery, and determining options for potential improvements, sustainability, and fiscal
responsibility.
DISCUSSION
In considering this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Priority of Customer
Excellence.
The Board approved an additional $8,600,000 in June 2024 to fund Access-on-Demand, and the
GM/CEO approved an additional $2,000,000 in December 2024, which sustains the program through
February 2025. Based on projected continual growth in demand for Access-on-Demand services, and
until sustainability recommendations of the peer review committee may be vetted and adopted, an
additional $15,814,441 is requested to continue to provide Access-on-Demand services through
December 2025 when the third-party contracts expire.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Additional funding for the Access-on-Demand program in the amount of $13,814,440 will be derived
from existing funds in the 2025 budget, and the remaining $2,000,000 will be made available through
the unrestricted reserve. Future funding for this program will be allocated through the annual budget
process.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the summary scope of work for a solicitation for security services.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Glyn Horn, Acting Co-Chief, Transit Police and Emergency Management
Michael Millage, Senior Manager, Commuter Rail Contract Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment police
officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD employees,
customers, facilities, and property, as well as federally required commuter rail second crewmember
duties.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, Allied Universal Security Services
was awarded a three-year contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security
services. The initial contract term expired June 30, 2022, and following three separate Board approvals,
RTD executed each of three additional one-year contract options. The third and final option year term
expires June 30, 2025. No additional contract options remain.
To continue to augment the overall security model with contracted security services, RTD staff will
publish a competitive solicitation for services to begin July 1, 2025.
DISCUSSION
If approved, staff will prepare a solicitation seeking contracted security services consistent with the
below summary scope of work.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:
• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through
recruitment and retention of contracted security personnel to support RTD Police throughout the
District yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves

Packet Pg. 141

2.17.G

• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability of Commuter Rail
Contracted Services to deploy unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby
improving system reliability and decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contracted services funding for this contract is included in the 2025 Budget.
