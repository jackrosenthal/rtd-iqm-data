Special Board Meeting
ERIK DAVIDSON: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Erik Davidson speaking. And I will now call the
Tuesday, December 3, special board meeting to order. We are convened as of 4:03 PM Mountain
Standard Time. I would respectfully ask anyone in attendance of this meeting to remain muted unless you
are recognized to speak. I will now call the roll for directors. Treasurer Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Present.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Director Broom. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Here.

ERIK DAVIDSON: And this is Chair Davidson speaking. I am present. That is 11 present, 3 absent. We
have a quorum. Please note that this special board meeting does not have a public comment section.
However, the public can still offer comments by email, in person, or participating remotely during the
regularly scheduled board meeting that will also take place this evening on December 3.

Our aim is to start that meeting on time at 5:30 PM. We may start later than 5:30 PM, contingent on how
long this meeting goes, but we will not start earlier than 5:30 PM. We'll next move to the next portion of
our agenda, which is an executive session. In a moment, the Board will meet in executive session to
discuss the successor collective bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001.
I would like to append the motion to move into executive session to state that the special board meeting
will be deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session. For public transparency, this means
that once the Board moves into executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned.
I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following, executive session
pursuant to Section 24-6-4024b CRS to receive legal advice and section 24-6-4024e CRS for determining
positions relative to matters that may be subject to negotiations regarding the successor collective
bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001.
Do I have a motion?
MICHAEL GUZMAN: So moved.
DOUG TISDALE: So moved.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I heard Secretary Guzman as the movement and the second as Tisdale. Is there any
discussion? Are there any no votes on moving into executive session? Seeing none, that will pass with 11
yes votes, 0 no votes. And the main meeting will be adjourned into executive session as of 4:06 PM
Mountain Standard Time.
For all those who are expected to attend, please stay seated. For directors joining online, please ensure
that you exit the public Zoom meeting and join via the executive session Zoom meeting. For everyone
else that is not entitled to be here, please vacate the room, and we'll take a few moments to get all of the
technology set up and our remote directors over to the other Zoom session.
So just stay seated, and I'll ask the Board Office to let me know when we've got everything in place. And
we'll proceed with the executive session. Thank you.
