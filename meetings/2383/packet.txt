A bill, but no genuine revenue solution
• House and Senate aim to get a final bill to the President’s desk before
the latest short-term extension expires on December 4.
• No long-term revenue solution – gas tax, VMT tax, or repatriated
revenues – to close the $15 billion annual gap between transportation
spending levels and gas tax revenues.
• Gas tax increase not politically viable option for either party.
• Instead, another General Fund transfer to the Highway Trust Fund,

offset with spending cuts and revenue increases for programs
throughout the Federal budget. Some offsets are controversial.

FY 2016 Appropriations Outlook
• Spending impasse resolved by the 2-year budget deal reached between
Congress and the President in October, increasing FY 2016 spending by $25
billion, spread across all non-defense programs.
• For transportation, the House and Senate bills are far apart, because
Senate bill includes post-budget deal spending increase:
• $71.6 billion in House
• $72.9 billion in Senate
• Differences between the bills also include large gap between House
($100m) and Senate ($600m) TIGER funding levels.
• Deadline: Current stop-gap spending bill expires December 11, so no time
to move 12 separate spending bills.
• Another Omnibus: House and Senate Appropriations Committees
negotiating an omnibus bill to fund all government programs and agencies
for the remainder of the fiscal year.

• President’s FY 2016 budget:
• $165 million for Eagle P3 FFGA
• $92 million for new FFGA for Southeast Rail Extension
• House and Senate transportation appropriations bills:
• Fully fund ongoing FFGAs, including the Eagle P3 project, but
• Significantly underfund the category of this year’s new FFGAs, which
includes the Southeast Rail Extension project.

Our Appropriations Strategy
• Eagle P3 FFGA will be fully funded this year (FY 2016)
• New FFGA for Southeast Rail Extension:
• We have been pushing both House and Senate appropriators to increase
funding for this new-projects category and give priority within the
category to the SERE – the only “one-and-done project” in the group.
• The Federal share of the SERE can be fully funded in a single year.
• Fiscally prudent choice given limited resources: Congress need not
start a funding commitment it cannot finish.
• Significant funding over-match by locals
• Strong project support by Mayor, local businesses, major employers
• Revised Senate bill introduced in November now includes $311 million
more for New Starts; FTA anticipates signing FFGA for SERE next April.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: November 24, 2015

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General
Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

November 23, 2015

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2015

Subject:

Approval of 2016 Granite Paver Maintenance
Contract Amendment for 16th Street Mall
Transitway Lanes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract
for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end
date from the current end date of July 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract
value by $1,000,000 to a total of $3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016
Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
RTD has maintained the granite pavers on 16th St. Mall Transitway since the mall was constructed in
1982. In 2013 the City and County of Denver committed to participate in the cost of maintenance and
pay RTD 30% of the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an annual maximum of $300,000.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. Gallegos is the current contractor performing
maintenance on the Transitway. Historically, Gallegos has utilized eight employees and material vendors
that supported approximately 10 to 20 jobs for each Work Order (WO). As needed, granite pavers are
purchased from a separate vendor (Cold Spring Granite).
The current maintenance contract was a three year contract that was awarded midyear 2013. This
amendment to extend the end date brings the contract period into alignment with our annual expense
budget. During the initial two years of the contract, the Mall required a greater amount of maintenance
than anticipated, and RTD has expended the total amount anticipated over the full three years of the
contract award. This amendment increases the total contract value to allow for expected activity for the
remainder of the third year of the contract as well as the five month extension to the end of 2016.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The available budget for Mall paver repairs in the 2016 Adopted Budget is $1,000,000, which will cover
the cost of this contract in 2016.

2.B.1

DBE / SBE GOAL
All work has and will be completed by a single contractor which is self-classified as a Woman Minority
Business Enterprise (WMBE). There was no DBE / SBE Goal established for the original contract.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to amend the contract for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos
Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end date from the current end date of July 31,
2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract value by $1,000,000 to a total of
$3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016 Adopted Budget.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Require a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) be issued for the
next 16th Street Mall Granite Maintenance contract, to be awarded on or before July 31, 2016,
and suspend all Work Orders when contract value funds are exhausted before the current end of
the contract term. This is not recommended as it will result in the deterioration of the mall pavers
with the resulting potential for pedestrian tripping hazards and damage to the mall shuttles,
possibly resulting in the suspension of shuttle service.

Policy
for
Joint
Development
Disposition of Real Property

and

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts
the attached Resolution which adopts the Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has two policies, Resolution 10, Series of 1984 and Resolution 35, Series of 2002, which
govern the disposition of real property and the joint development of real property. The Board has also
granted authorization for real property transactions under the grants of authority given for the FasTracks
infrastructure projects. As those projects currently under construction come to completion, an updated
policy is needed that provides for a consistent and efficient method of managing RTD’s real property
assets.
DISCUSSION
Staff has presented an overview of the issues and proposed policy as updates in June and August, and
provided a draft of the policy for Board review in November. Minor changes and clarifications have been
made to the November draft and are attached, showing track changes, to this Board report, as
Attachment A.
The proposed resolution repeals the existing resolutions and adopts the attached Policy for Joint
Development and Disposition of Real Property.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The policy identifies process and guidelines for disposition of real property or joint development of real
property, and as such has no financial impact in and of itself. The financial impact of any disposition or
joint development will be considered on a case by case basis as it arises.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action: It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution which adopts the
Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action: Do not adopt the attached Resolution.

operate a regional mass transportation system; and,
WHEREAS: During the course of implementing the regional transit system,
the District has acquired and will in the future acquire various real property

uses in a joint development project; and,
WHEREAS: The District has adopted Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and
Resolution 35, Series of 2002, to govern disposition of real property and joint
development; and,
WHEREAS: The District has grown in size and scale since the adoption of
Resolution 10 in 1984, and a revised policy is needed to allow the District to
efficiently and effectively manage its real property assets.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
The RTD Board of Directors hereby repeals both Resolution 10, Series of 1984,
and Resolution 35, Series of 2002 in their entirety, and adopts the attached Policy
for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.

Formatted: Font: 14 pt
Formatted: Top: 0.69", Bottom: 0.69"

I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. During the course of
implementing the regional transit system, the District has acquired and will in the future
acquire various real property interests for transit related uses. As the District’s needs change
over time, real property once needed for transit purposes may no longer be needed and may
be disposed of, or may be utilized more efficiently and effectively if combined with transit
supportive uses in a joint development project. This policy replaces prior District policies on
disposition and joint development, including Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and Resolution 35,
Series of 2002, and identifies procedures for authorizing the disposition of excess real property,
or the joint development of District real property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has no current or future transit
interest.
3. Fair Market Value: The amountprice at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
4. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project
costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
5. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts
the attached Resolution
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has no formal policy that holistically addresses unsolicited proposals for joint development
or unsolicited offers to acquire excess real property. RTD’s unsolicited proposal policy for goods and
services explicitly excludes real property while RTD’s Strategic Plan for Transit Oriented Development
provides general guidance for reviewing unsolicited development proposals, but needs additional
clarifying regarding process for selection of a development partner.
DISCUSSION
Staff has presented an overview of the issues and proposed policy as updates in June and August, and
provided a draft of the policy for Board review in November. During the November update, and in
comments provided to staff, Board Directors have expressed concerns about the sole source criteria
identified in the joint development context, and have asked for some additional process clarifications. A
comparison version showing tracked changes for the proposed changes to the policy is attached as
Attachment A.
As a result of those comments, staff recommends the following modifications to the policy draft
provided in November.
1) For joint development proposals, the District will accept unsolicited proposals, but will
advertise all joint development opportunities competitively. A chart illustrating the unsolicited
joint development proposal review process is attached to the policy.
2) For excess real property, the District may enter into negotiations with a contiguous property
owner without a competitive solicitation when the District property is configured in a way that it
cannot be developed as a stand-alone parcel due to factors such as size, shape, or access.

The proposed resolution repeals Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TOD and adopts the attached
Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property.

Packet Pg. 30

2.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The policy identifies process and guidelines for disposition of real property or joint development of real
property, and as such has no financial impact in and of itself. The financial impact of any disposition or
joint development will be considered on a case by case basis as it arises.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution which adopts the
Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action: Do not adopt the attached Resolution.

I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation

adopted the Revised Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution 17 Series of 2010), in order to enhance
the value and effectiveness of transit in the district by increasing ridership, and providing
opportunities for enhanced transit infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to encourage
innovation in leveraging RTD’s real property assets while establishing a consistent process and
transparent criteria for review and acceptance of any unsolicited proposals.
This policy replaces Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TODTransit Oriented Development
(revised, 2010) and establishes policies and procedures for the review of unsolicited proposals
from third parties wishing to acquire excess District Property or proposing a joint development
of District Property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has determined there is no current

3. Exclusive Negotiation Period: period of time which is granted to an entity to exclusively
negotiate with RTD staff the terms of a property disposition or joint development prior
to Board approval. During the Exclusive Negotiation Period, the District will not market
the property or consider alternate proposals for disposition or joint development.
4. Fair Market Value: The amountprice at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
