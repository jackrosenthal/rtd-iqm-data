## III. Other Matters

Chair Pro Tem Hoy asked if there were any other matters.  He stated that he believes the North Metro Groundbreaking went well and that everyone was on point.

General Manager Washington provided these updates:

- April 22-24, the House Transportation and Infrastructure P3 panel will be in Denver to tour a number of transportation and infrastructure related projects (i.e. RTD, US 36 Mayors and Commissioners, DIA). He had extended this invitation when he was testifying before this Committee in Washington D.C.; however, the T&I staff are coordinating the activities during this trip and RTD will be following their lead. They are expecting 10 of the 11 P3 Panel members to participate.  He will keep the full Board advised as the planning proceeds.  Director Folska recommended that we include State Representative Nancy Todd in this schedule as she chairs the Legislative Transportation Committee.  General Manager Washington indicated we would look at this but emphasized the T&I staff will be making the decisions around who to include.

- DUS Grand Opening—General Manager Washington indicated two primary events during this time along with the normal schedule of activities.

1.       DUS Gala-May 8, 2014—They currently have reservations for over 700 people with a planned capacity of 1000.  There is a cost associated with this Gala of approximate $100 per head.  They do expect this to be a sellout event.  They are not planning to have speakers at this event but have a video featuring about 15-20 people which they will run during the event.

2.       May 9—They will begin the morning with a P3 Roundtable that will be hosted by Patton and Boggs. This roundtable is expected to run from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. where they will walk to the noon event.    2 panels are planned:  P3 Public Sector Perspective (i.e. Eagle, DUS, US 36) which will include Theresa McMillan (FTA), General Manager Washington, Don Hunt (CDOT) and anticipated moderator who is chair of the APTA P3 Committee.  Chair Sisk will probably provide some type of opening remarks but they are looking for a high profile individual to facilitate-perhaps Michael Melaniphy, President of APTA.

P3 Private Sector—Anticipate panel to include Goldman Sachs, Kiewit, Plenary Roads and Fluor who are all big players in the P3 space.  The lady from George Mason who moderated in Washington D.C. will moderate this panel.  They are planning to use a local high profile like Bill Mosher to facilitate.

Transportation Secretary Foxx will be providing comments but will be interacting with WIN participants.  This is more in line with one of his major focus.  Mayor Hancock will close out the P3 event.

They are anticipating a capacity of about 500 people which will be by invitation only.

Director Tobiassen inquired if APTA has any white papers on P-3.  General Manager Washington indicated that he will check but RTD is the national expert as the only domestic transit agency with P3 experience.

Director Bagley commented it would be nice to invite the George Mason team.  General Manager Washington indicated they have been invited.

Director Folska noted that when they met with Department of Transportation Under-Deputy Secretary Victor Mendez in Washington D.C., they were quite interested in the public engagement component of this and had asked RTD to provide a white paper.  It would be good to invite Victor Mendez to this event.  General Manager Washington indicated he plans to extend this invitation.

- Director Bagley indicated he was at the meeting to follow up on his previous request to extend an invitation to Tami Door-- DDP, and Elba Wedgeworth, to attend a Board meeting to talk about the collaborative efforts with RTD.  He would like to see this happen prior to the May 9 opening of DUS.  General Manager Washington responded he thinks this is in the bailiwick of the Board office.  Director Bagley requested Paula Perdue to follow up with Chair Sisk on making this happen.

- Director Tobiassen inquired on thoughts about how to make sure the CAC is fully engaged.  This is a good group of people and we need to be using them effectively.  Director Folska inquired what will happen to CAC upon the completion of FasTracks.  General Manager Washington responded that he believes their role will evolve as the project evolves into the operational side of FasTracks.

- General Manager Washington indicated staff will have a Free Metro Ride Bus outside the 1600 Blake Street address next Tuesday for the Board to see.
