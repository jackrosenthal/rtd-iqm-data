BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: March 20, 2014

Subject:

Budget Transfer for West Rail Line Track
Paving

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of the remaining funds from the Wadsworth
parking structure project to install track paving at three RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
BACKGROUND
RTD Light Rail Operations Division was notified by the train operators of pedestrians’ crossing over the
open ballast area to board trains at three stations. All of the light rail stations have an ADA approved
crossing; however, they are in a specified location and are not being used by the general public.
Additionally, representatives from Safety and Security noticed this action shortly after revenue services
started. As this poses a significant safety issue, we are proposing to fill the ballasted area between the
designated ADA crossings with concrete. This would create a solid, safe crossing structure for the
general public to use as needed and diminish the prospect of an individual tripping or falling in or near
the tracks.
The three specific stations are located at the Federal Center, Auraria West and the Sheridan Station.
DISCUSSION
Work will include the track paving at these three stations along with all required coordination with RTD
Light Rail personnel for site access. Work will be conducted during a scheduled Light Rail shut down or
with single tracking during off-peak areas so as not to inconvenience the traveling public and to provide
worker safety during the project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As part of the West Rail Line (WRL) transit corridor, located between the Auraria Campus in downtown
Denver and the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, RTD constructed two parking structures
at Wadsworth and Sheridan. Swinerton Builders was awarded a contract for both structures. The
portion of the overall WRL budget for the garages was $37.2M. The project was completed on schedule
and under budget. Funds from this underrun will be used to fund the track paving work. Funding for this
transfer is available in the 2014 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of
the remaining funds from the Wadsworth parking structure project to install track paving at three
RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to transfer the funds. Instead, leave the three West Corridor Light Rail Stations as they currently are
with the pedestrian’s crossing over the open ballast. This alternative is not recommended as it

continues to permit RTD’s patrons crossing and acting in an unsafe manner.

Property Acquisition for the North Metro
Rail Line Phase 2

F.

Clarke,Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 20, 2014

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail
Line Phase 2 from 72nd Avenue to 124th Avenue, Adams County, Colorado and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General
Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property
transactions.
BACKGROUND
Right of way necessary for the construction of the project must be acquired. Properties required for
Phase I (south of 72nd Avenue) were approved by the Board in September 2011 and May 2013. Property
needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process.
This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff recommends proceeding with the acquisition of all property identified,
subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or design/build activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail Line Phase 2 and authorizing staff to proceed with
all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or his
designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property transactions.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
NORTH METRO SEGMENT 1 COMMUTER RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Rail Line Phase II; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list
the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation
to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the
authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it
deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the
power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the North
Metro Rail Line Phase II, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a
significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit
from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that
there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in
furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are for the benefit of the public
health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Manager, as the Board’s
delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for the
acquisition of the property and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any property through good
faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power
of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property
owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of
owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties
as soon as permitted by law.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 27, 2014

Board Meeting Date: March 20, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the West Colfax Business
Improvement District for the Transfer of RTD
Shelters & RTD Site Maintenance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of
ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2 trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the
purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the
2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
BACKGROUND
The West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) has received a grant from Denver’s Office of
Economic Development. As a part of this grant the WC-BID is proposing to refurbish 7 older “Daytech”
passenger shelters, which currently belong to RTD, into an artistic, one-of-a-kind, functional artwork to
replace the older shelters along a portion of W. Colfax between Irving St. and Sheridan Blvd. The WCBID has commissioned an artist to perform this refurbishment and will provide any and all special
maintenance needs for these shelters and other transit amenities (benches and trash receptacles). RTD’s
Facilities Maintenance currently maintains the existing shelters and provides site custodial services.
DISCUSSION
The WC-BID has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 7 of the older Daytech style shelters with
map cases & wood benches, and 2 existing trash receptacles to them for refurbishment, reinstallation
and future capital maintenance thereof. The WC-BID also has requested reimbursement from RTD for
the purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. Additionally, it is requested that RTD continue
to provide routine custodial maintenance at the proposed 7 locations, which would include sweeping,
trash removal, snow removal and periodic washing similar to that currently performed by RTD.
RTD currently has 5 shelters (of 3 different styles) at 7 of the proposed locations; a 6th shelter was
recently removed for redevelopment at the southeast corner of W. Colfax and Irving. All locations have
sufficient passenger boardings to warrant RTD shelters and site custodial services.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements at the
following 7 locations along West Colfax; 1) Winona EB, (2) Raleigh WB, (3) Raleigh EB, (4) Meade EB,
(5) Knox Ct. EB, (6) Irving WB, and (7) Irving EB:. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:






Routine and Capital Maintenance Responsibilities
Transfer of shelters, benches, and trash receptacle ownership
Easement/License Agreements and/or ROW determinations and allowances
Resolving structural design issues
Bus Operations, Facility Maintenance, IT, Safety & Security concerns and/or needs

Packet Pg. 21

2.11.C

The proposed IGA includes provisions allowing RTD full and continued use of the transit improvements
by its patrons and maintenance personnel. The IGA also addresses an initial 5-year term with automatic
annual renewal provisions. Termination options are included if the WC-BID does not uphold the terms of
the IGA, which includes capital maintenance of the shelters.
An RTD Management Directive entitled “Special Design Requests for Bus Passenger Shelters” identifies a
Board Policy in regards to local governments requesting passenger shelters that differ from RTD’s
standard design. It states: “RTD agrees to share in the cost of installing another type of shelter in an
amount equal to the average cost of installing an RTD standard shelter, provided, that the local agency
agrees to obtain all necessary permits, licenses and agreements, to retain full ownership of such shelter,
to indemnify RTD from any and all damages that may arise out of public use of such shelter, and to
maintain such passenger shelter in good repair and in a clean and safe condition at all times.”
The Capital Programs Engineering staff believes this proposal is within the limits of this policy, with the
possible exception of the maintenance aspect. RTD will provide routine custodial maintenance of the
bus stops. WC-BID will provide any and all capital maintenance, which includes repairing and/or
replacing damage from ordinary wear and tear, vandalism, destruction, glass replacement and painting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD would reimburse WC-BID for the cost of five new trash receptacles, which is estimated at $5,000.
Funding for this reimbursement is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
The Daytech shelters to be transferred to the WC-BID are fully depreciated and have no book value.
Therefore, the donation would have no financial impact to RTD.
There would be no net impact to RTD’s shelter maintenance costs because RTD currently provides
custodial services at the seven sites, and would continue to do so under the IGA. In the long run, RTD
would save the cost of replacing the seven Daytech shelters, which is estimated at $87,000. The
timing of these savings is not known because RTD had not programmed replacement of these shelters in
2014.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or designee to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business
Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2
trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the purchase and installation of 5 new trash
receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local
government requests.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in leaving
the local area bus stops in a poor condition that is unacceptable to the WC-BID. This could
potentially mean the loss of its grant funding. This would require that RTD continue its custodial and
capital maintenance of the 5 existing shelters. This could result in RTD needing to upgrade all the
RTD bus stops with new amenities and providing both custodial and capital maintenance at our sole
cost.
3. Delay acceptance of the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This could result in a

Packet Pg. 22

2.11.C

possible loss of the currently approved WC-BID grant, which needs to move forward with committed
action by the end of the 2014 2nd Qtr.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 12, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 12, 2014

Board Meeting Date: March 20, 2014

Subject:

Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group
24” contracted fixed-route transit services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for
an amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $22,578,190
(option year 1) and $23,750,230 (option year 2), for a total five year amount not to exceed
$107,367,070. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract term, $4,725,730 for
option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of $23,098,814 for the five year period.
This results in a total contract amount not to exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract
period and $130,465,884 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and
responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide
“Group 24” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective on August 17, 2014.
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated by Senate Bill 88-164 revised in 1999 under HB99-1030, revised in 2003 under
HB03-1103, and revised in 2007 under SB07-251, RTD “may implement a system under which up to
fifty-eight percent (58%) of the District’s vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses
pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts.”
In January of 2014, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide contracted fixed-route transit services, referred to as “Group 24”. The Group 24 service
package represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under Contract Group 20,
and includes local and express service in the Denver metro area. The RFP was mailed to 14 firms
who indicated an interest in proposing on opportunities to provide contracted fixed-route services.
Proposals were due on February 26, 2014.
The Group 24 service offering consists of 110 buses operating 35 routes providing approximately
326,000 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in Group 24 is included as
Attachment A. The entire Group 24 service package is currently operated by First Transit.
Implementation of Group 24 service is scheduled to be effective August 17, 2014. The award of
“Group 24” service to First Transit as recommended, will maintain RTD’s current status of providing
approximately 57% of RTD vehicular service by private contractor.
DISCUSSION:
Two (2) proposals were received in response to RFP 14-DH-003 for the Provision of Group 24 Public
Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, and MV Transportation.

2.12.D

It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 14-DH-003, that RTD award a contract for Group 24 fixed route transit service to First Transit.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria
as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications
and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Dean Shaklee, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Carolyn
Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Zamy Silva,
Manager, SBO; Amanda Murray, Civil Rights Specialist; and Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the two
proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative
criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for
“Experience and Qualifications.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in these
categories, First Transit was the highest rated technical proposal followed by MV Transportation. The
score for the “SBE plan and goal attainment” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD SBO
staff (both First Transit and MV Transportation met the SBE goal) and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and SBE score of each proposal to
determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in First Transit
being the highest rated proposal followed by MV Transportation. First Transit received an overall total
score of 93 (out of 100); MV Transportation received an overall total score of 87. It was the consensus
of the evaluation team that First Transit presented the best proposal in terms of understanding of the
project, proposed management team, proposed organization/business plan/approach to deliver the
requested service.
First Transit was not the lowest priced proposal. The difference in price over the five-year period
between First Transit and MV Transportation was $66,047 or $13,209 per year. The overall rating
represents the evaluation process conclusion that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal
outweighed the strengths of the MV proposal. While the strengths of the MV Transportation proposal
included, experience with “Maximus” maintenance reporting software and a detailed start-up plan, the
MV Transportation proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of vehicle maintenance plan; facility
plan; personnel plan; and the recent/relevant experience (day to day operations) of the managers
proposed.
A key strength of the First Transit proposal was the proposed management team. Under this team’s
leadership, the First Transit Commerce City division consistently meets/exceeds many of the RTD
quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive relationships
with Denver metropolitan area governments and communities. The team is experienced in providing
service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and, consequently, no disruption of service when
transitioning from the “Group 20” contract to the new “Group 24” contract. First Transit also proposed
very detailed maintenance, operations and safety/training plans; and committed to obtaining the ASE
Blue Seal rating with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence by 2016. The local
operation is also supported by experienced professionals at the Regional level.
First Transit provides medical, dental, life, and short-term disability insurance for employees. First
Transit pays 100% of the cost of the employee-only premium for medical insurance and contributes

Packet Pg. 28

2.12.D

$100 per month toward the employee-plus-one benefit level, and $200 per month toward the family
benefit level. First Transit pays 100% of the cost for life insurance coverage for each full-time
employee, and 100% of the cost of the short-term disability plan for each full-time employee.
First Transit’s proposed first year price for “Group 24” is 6.8% lower than the current contract price of
the “Group 20” contract that it replaces. First Transit’s proposed hourly rates for the five-year period of
the proposed contract range from $60.06 (contract year 1) to $64.70 (contract year 5). The hourly
rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from $61.97-$69.48 (current contract year) to
$65.44-$69.48 (contract year 5). The total five-year proposed price represents a $29.6 million savings
over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the
recommended firm’s proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in
response to the RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of
technical, SBE and price issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and
communicated in the RFP document.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the Group 24 service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for First Transit’s provision of the services is included in First Transit’s Direct Service Cost as
shown in Attachment B.

Packet Pg. 29

2.12.D

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the adopted
2014 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to MV Transportation, the second ranked proposer. This is not
recommended as it does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation
process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 24 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.
