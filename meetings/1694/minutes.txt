Recommended Actions
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager, Customer & Contracted Services presented
this item to the Board. Bruce distributed a PowerPoint presentation and walked
through the proposal. Information included in the briefing book includes background
information on RTD fare policy including current fare structure, RTD fare history,
peer property comparison that shows RTD’s fares compared to other systems,
information regarding method of payment and customer profiles from recent
customer satisfaction surveys, information about the farebox recovery ratios from
the various classes of RTD service (local, express, regional, etc.), the proposed fare
changes and a proposed timeline for the fare change process.
Public Hearings will be conducted through August and September. The proposals
take effect January 1, 2011.
2011 Fare Policy Public Input Process
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors direct RTD staff to solicit public input regarding staff
recommended changes to the RTD fare policy. The recommended changes would
increase cash fares for local, express, regional and skyRide service by
approximately 12.5 percent and would also include corresponding increases in other
multi-ride tickets and passes including Eco Pass products. Following consideration
of public input, staff is further directed to present a final recommendation to the
RTD Board no later than the regularly scheduled Board meeting in October.
Director Tayer shared that this is not something we want to do - it is a step we
take cautiously. He is looking forward to public input on this. Director Tayer also
applauded staff for their efforts to increase non-profit agency participation.
Bruce Abel indicated that they are anticipating continuing the $5 surcharge for
Skyride Service and once the data is received from the SmartCard it will be rolled in
to the re-pricing of the Eco Pass Program.
Director Tobiassen requested a comparison of the fare increases since 1999 against
the Consumer Pricing Index so we can get a feeling for how they have been doing
compared to the cost of living. He asked if there is any idea of what fare evasion
such as counterfeit passes might be costing RTD.
Director O’Boyle thanked staff for a very thorough report and requested a list of
non-profit organizations that are participating.
While in Vancouver, Director
O’Boyle noticed there was a $5 surcharge only from the Airport to Vancouver and
mentioned that might be something to think about in the DIA pricing model.
Director Martinez would like to know how many agencies work with folks who are
unemployed and looking for work.
Director Christopher requested taking this a step further when going out to the
public by encouraging Phil and staff to turn the presentation into a mini budget
review for 2011 rather than just focusing on fare increase.

Director Bagley requested information on peer agencies across the country who
may be considering an upcoming fare increase.
Director Cohen asked if this increase being proposed is enough. He would rather
give constituents the big picture and not nickel and dime them to death. Director
Cohen would like to see some projections that correlate to different structures of a
fare increase and what that would look like in terms of revenue projections.
Several Board Members expressed gratitude to staff for such a complete and
thorough report.
General Manager Phil Washington informed the Board that staff is looking at the
public hearings as an educational type session.
