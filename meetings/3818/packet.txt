BACKGROUND
On March 27, 2025, negotiators for RTD and ATU 1001 reached a tentative agreement on a successor
CBA. On June 27, 2025, the ATU 1001 President advised RTD’s GM/CEO that 97% of the bargaining
unit’s membership ratified the tentative agreement.
DISCUSSION
The tentative agreement demonstrates the agency’s commitment to meet the Strategic Priorities of
Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success by ensuring
employees are paid a competitive, market-based wage and improving employees’ quality of life while
enhancing operational performance and efficiencies.
RTD and ATU negotiators commenced bargaining in July 2024. All Articles, Sections, Memoranda of
Understanding, and Side Letters were carefully examined and discussed during the negotiations.
There was an overall restructuring and consolidation of the agreement to organize language into its
proper flow, increase ease of reference, and reduce redundancy. Article III-Operations Groups of the
tentative successor agreement includes all prior provisions of Article III-Bus Operations, Article VII-Light
Rail Operations, Article X-Commuter Rail Engineers, and Article XII-Commuter Rail Conductors. Article
IV-Maintenance Groups of the new CBA includes all prior provisions of Article IV-Maintenance, Article
VIII-Light Rail Maintenance, and Article XI-Commuter Rail Maintenance.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Recognition of Reverend Wade Blank via Honorary Name for
Civic Center Station

July 24, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt an honorary name for Civic Center Station to recognize the life and
career of Reverend Wade Blank and, in adopting the honorary name, change the name of Civic Center
Station to Wade Blank Civic Center Station.
REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
Steven Brier, Senior Manager of Marketing
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the Honorary Property and Station Naming Policy,
Procedures, and Review Rubric (the Policy). As a result, the Board Office created an application of
interest for community members to submit proposals to add an honorary name to an RTD station or
property. That application of interest launched on October 1, 2024. Following the opening of the
application, community members, who want the Board of Directors to add an honorary name to Civic
Center Station to recognize the contributions of Reverend Wade Blank, submitted completed application
packet on April 28, 2025.
A completed application packet includes the following items:
1. A narrative on the proposed honorees contributions to transit locally, nationally, and their
connection with the property for which the applicants are proposing an honorary name
2. Support letters from community members and local leaders for the proposed honorary name
3. A resolution or proclamation from the local city council or board of county commissioners
supporting the honorary name
The completed application packet in support of adding an honorary name to Civic Center Station to
recognize the life and career of Rev. Blank is attached to this board report. It should be noted that the
completed application packet includes 28 letters of support as well as a proclamation approved
unanimously by the Denver City Council supporting the honorary name proposal.

Packet Pg. 9

1.3.B

Subsequent to the receipt of the completed application packet, the Board Office convened an Honorary
Property Name Proposal Review Committee (Review Committee), which was charged with reviewing the
submitted application materials, meeting with the community members proposing the honorary name,
and making a recommendation to the Executive Committee on whether to pursue further the proposed
honorary name. As proscribed in the Policy, the Review Committee met three times: first to understand
the criteria and process established by the Board for consideration and potential adoption of an honorary
name, next to meet with the community members proposing the honorary name, and finally to make a
recommendation to the Executive Committee regarding the proposed honorary name.
The Policy defines that the Review Committee be comprised of eight individuals from both within and
outside of the agency, with each individual fulfilling a specific role. The Review Committee was
comprised of the following positions and individuals:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The General Manager/CEO or her designee - John McKay, Chief of Staff
Civil Rights Division staff member – Gabe Christie, Manager, ADA
Operations staff member – Erik Wright, Deputy Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
Communications and Engagement staff member – Steven Brier, Senior Manager, Marketing
Board Office Executive Manager, Jack Kroll
External historian, Associate Professor Rachel Gross, Co-Director of Public History Program,
University of Colorado Denver
Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities Chair or their designee – Earl Lee, past Chair
CAC Co-Chair or their designee, Caitlynn Fortner, member

The Review Committee evaluated the application packet based on the following eligibility criteria outlined
in the Policy:
1. Documented significant contributions to public transit nationally, and/or
2. Documented significant contributions to public transit within the RTD, and/or
3. Documented direct connection with a significant event occurring in the vicinity of the property
subject to a potential renaming.
4. Must be deceased for 10 or more years
5. Cannot be a former RTD Director
Further the Policy’s review rubric sets forth the following three evaluative criteria.
1. Historical significance to RTD or transit
2. Breadth and depth of community support
3. Alignment with RTD’s values (passion, respect, diversity, trustworthiness, collaboration, and
ownership)
And the Policy’s review rubric establishes the following rating categories and associated point ranges:
•
•
•

Does Not Meet Expectations (0 points)
Approaching Expectations (1-2 points)
Meets Expectations (3-4 points)

Packet Pg. 10

1.3.B

•

Exceeds Expectations (5-7 points)

After a thorough review, the Review Committee unanimously recommended to the Executive Committee
that the Board further pursue an honorary name for Civic Center Station to recognize the many
contributions of Rev. Blank. The results of the Review Committee’s scoring are below:

The recommendation was based on Rev. Blank’s many contributions to transit locally, nationally, and his
direct connection to Civic Center Station.
At its meeting on June 18, 2025, the Executive Committee concurred with the Review Committee’s
assessment and provided consensus support to bringing the proposed honorary name to the Executive
Committee and Board for action during the July meeting cycle.
DISCUSSION
Rev. Blank co-founded Atlantis Community, Incorporated (Atlantis), which is a Denver-based non-profit
organization in operation for over 50 years. Atlantis was established by Rev. Blank to assist people with
disabilities to live independently. One key element of being able to live independently is the ability to
access transit options. Rev. Blank’s work with Atlantis led to formal engagements with and peaceful
protests of RTD that resulted in RTD significantly increasing mobility options for disabled people.
Further Rev. Blank contributed significantly to transit nationally by leading engagements and peaceful
protests of transit agencies across the country and with the American Public Transportation Association
(APTA) to advocate for greater mobility options for people with disabilities. This work is widely regarded
as having contributed significantly to the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, which
had the effect of greatly expanding transit resources for people with disabilities.
On July 5 and 6, 1978, Rev. Blank helped to lead a protest that later came to be known as the Gang of
19 Protest in which 19 disabled individuals surrounded two RTD buses on the corner of Colfax Avenue
and Broadway Boulevard—directly across Colfax Avenue from the where Civic Center Station sits today.
The protest was done to raise awareness around the lack of wheelchair lifts on RTD buses. As a result
of the protest, RTD agreed to purchase wheelchair lifts for a significant portion of the existing fleet of
buses. Additionally, this protest gathered significant local and national media attention and spawned
similar peaceful protests across the country in which individuals were able to draw attention to the lack
of public investment in transit options for disabled people. In 1995, RTD dedicated a plaque in Rev.

Packet Pg. 11

1.3.B

Blank’s honor that is installed at Civic Center Station; that plaque was re-dedicated in 2023 following a
significant renovation to the station.
While the final decision on any honorary name for Civic Center Station rests with the Board of Directors,
the Review Committee recommended that the name of the station be updated to Wade Blank Civic
Center Station. This name is what the community members who submitted the application requested,
and matches the proposed name contained in Denver City Council’s proclamation, which was
unanimously approved on April 28th.
The Board is asked to discuss the merits of this Recommended Action to honor Rev. Blank and vote. Per
the Board’s Policy, a two-thirds vote is required to approve any honorary name.
Further, should the Board approve of the honorary name, staff anticipates a phased approach to making
necessary changes to the physical signage at Civic Center Station, shelterboard signage throughout the
district, and references to the station across the agency’s digital assets. These changes are anticipated
to be substantially completed by the start of the January 2026 Service Changes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of updating signage, marketing the change, and hosting an event to engage with the
public and media regarding the name change is estimated to be $98,000. The funding will be allocated
from the General Manager and CEO’s contingency fund.

This is a request to the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to rename the
Civic Center Transit Station, located at Broadway and Colfax, to be renamed Civic Center
Station at Wade Blank Bus Terminal or (some other variation that includes his name)
Background: Two years ago Joe Beaver, a lifelong disability activist requested that the
renaming of Civic Center Station be in honor of Wade Blank.
Since that request, a working group of disability advocates has collected more than 40
letters of support for the effort. The letters of support include members of the disability
community, leaders of disability organizations, elected officials past and present, and
leaders in business and the general public.
The working group is requesting that RTD begin the process of appointing a working
committee, required by RTD renaming of property rules, no later April 1st, 2025 .
Below, is a section of a book “From Freak to Freedom” (A History of the Disability Rights
Movement) authored by Joe Beaver.
As you read, you will understand the impact the Reverend Wade Bland had on the civil
rights movement for both able and disabled individuals, access to transportation both
locally and nationally and the genesis of what we know today as independent living for
people with disabilities.
Sincerely,
Working Group: Jaime Lewis, Colorado Cross Disability Coalition, Joe Beaver, Disability
Activist, Brian Grewe, Executive Director Atlantis Community, Marrissa Carillo Atlantis,
Mark Simon Disability Activist, Curtis Garrett , Atlantis

Wade Blank
Wade Blank, a Presbyterian minister from Ohio, first found his passion for civil rights when
he marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma, Alabama. His church congregation in
Ohio insisted on more pompless protests. He was a minister at the University of Ohio when
National Guardsmen shot down four student protesters. Wade had needed a fresh start. So
he headed west to the Heritage House Nursing Home in Lakewood.
Rev. Wade Blank
The State of Colorado offered him a job where he could do some good. State institution
housing, where throw-away kids were often sent, were shutting down. Heritage House
nursing home saw a need to be filled and hired Wade Blank to be a Youth counselor and to
recruit new young residents. He was perfect for the job.- young, hip, long hair and all. But
ordained, steady, and level headed.
Or so they thought.
Wade recalled those Heritage smells upon arrival - urine and antiseptic. And then that first
meal. Baked potatoes, applesauce, and scrambled eggs. Cold. The old folks, with teeth
worn out from a lifetime of steak and corn on the cob, may have been grateful, or maybe
not. But the young people, for all their other maladies, had strong enough teeth. He could
make a difference here. He started by asking them a question they'd never been asked
before: What do you want?

After cranking up the rock 'n' roll radio and replacing the squishy food, and the 8:00 druginduced bedtime, he brought in a TV and tuned it to Laugh-In instead of Lawrence Welk.
The place rocked like a college dorm.

He got a van to haul them and their wheelchairs to discover new adeventures. They headed
to the mountains, wheeled around in the dirt, smelled the pine, felt the spray from
waterfalls, heard the crackle of campfire, and ate s'mores. They cheered at baseball
games. They hooted at professional wrestling matches and went out for ice cream.
The effort involved in getting them into concert venues would have challenged the biblical
Samson, but it was totally worth it. They rocked with the Grateful Dead at Denver Coliseum
and sang "Rocky Mountain High" along with John Denver at RedRocks. Some with gusto,
others croaked it out.
It wasn't enough. Nothing could ever be enough. No amount of ice cream and music could
fix a prison. The institution they were in was a prison for the innocent. How can you make a
nursing home acceptable? You just can't. What they needed was freedom. Wade suggested
to Heritage House that they provide services to some young residents at their own homes.
Of course, that would mean empty beds at the nursing home, so that idea was rejected
immediately.
Like the Presbyterian Church before them, Heritage House thought they'd hired a
progressive and got a radical instead - a crazy one!
But, when he took a group of residents to the Capitol to testify about the deplorable
conditions at Heritage House, he got fired...and fired up.
He moved eighteen severely disabled people to live independently and make their own
decisions at an apartment complex on 11th & Federal in Denver. Wade and Barry
Rosenberg helped them dress, toilet, and whatever they needed. Dr. Stuart Ferguson wrote
the prescriptions for them to live independently. Several Heritage House staff members
followed.
Mike Smith was one of the first residents to be set free from Heritage House. Upon his
release, he discovered that the nursing home owners had forged his signature on his
monthly $25 personal needs money from Medicaid. Mike's attorney, John Holland, filed suit
against Heritage House for illegally misappropriating and withholding"personal needs"
money of patients, inadequate care, and intimidating and threatening residents who seek
legal counsel. Funds from that lawsuit were used to purchase more housing and make
renovations. Apartment doors were widened, counters lowered, and attendants were hired
to help the individuals. Whatever assistance a person needed, they figured a way. They
pooled their Medicaid and SSI money and called themselves the Atlantis Community.
But the freedom was incomplete. None of the Atlantis residents could drive. A bus drove
past their apartments countless times a day, but there was no way to get a wheelchair on

board. RTD's Handi-Ride pretended to be an option. There were only twelve little buses for
five thousand subscribers. A typical call to Handi-Ride went like this:
Dialing . . .
Hello, Handi-Ride here.
I need a ride to the grocery store.
I'll put you down for a week from today.
I'm out of food!
'Shoulda thought of that sooner.
Dialing . . .
Hello, Handi-Ride here.
Can I get a ride to the Lakewood Grill?
That's a tavern. You shouldn't be drinking.
Dialing . . .
Hello, Handi-Ride.
Can I get a ride to church?
'Got an opening in two weeks at nine.
Service is every Sunday at eight o'clock.
There are TV evangelists for shut-ins, ya know.
So Atlantis went political. Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit, ADAPT, was
formed, and they wheeled over to the Regional Transportation District Board to talk and talk
and talk.
"The wheelchair ban on regularly scheduled buses is for your own good," RTD insisted,
"plus, you understand we can't inconvenience able-bodied riders."
ADAPT wrote letters to the City Council, the Legislature, and Congress, petitioned, made a
nuisance of themselves, and sued. The judge expressed concern for their safety.
Somebody might get hurt, he fretted.
Their concerns fell on deaf ears.

July 5, 1978, went something like this:
"Let's roll!" Wade lifted his arm and waved.
A man in his chair, hands on the wheels, pushed toward the bus stop.
"Kick some ass!" Wade said as the man rolled past to the edge of the curb. A bus pulled up.
The man waited.

The door swung open. "Waddaya want?" said the
driver.
"I want to ride."
"What are you? Crazy?"
Of course, this was crazy, but none of the gang would admit it.
"No, I just want to ride." Calm but firm.

inflection.
The man wheeled himself right in front of the bus.
Thirty protesters witnessed it - eighteen in wheelchairs,
plus friends and family.
"Get out of here!" the driver yelled, flailing his arms, panic raising his voice. "What the hell
are you doing? There's another bus behind me, and you're blocking the way."
“exactly”.
Wade lifted his arm again, motioning toward the bus at the curb. Eighteen more
wheelchairs moved forward. Some people rolled in front of the bus. Others to each side. A
few in the back of the second bus. There, they stopped. Two buses surrounded,
immobilized.
"We will ride!" they shouted. "WE WILL RIDE!!"

Cars started stacking up down Colfax and Broadway. The intersection Traffic came to a
stand still. . Diesel fumes got thick. Passengers exited the trapped buses. Most looked
bewildered. Their faces revealed their thoughts: What in holy hell is going on?
Disabled people weren't supposed to go crazy, carry signs, and block buses. They're
supposed to stay indoors, have their food brought to them on a tray, watch soap operas or
something.
But what about freedom? Rosa Parks got famous by refusing to go to the back of the bus.
Disabled people couldn't even get on the bus.
Wade searched the bus passengers' faces for pity and saw little. Some looked red-faced
and angry. That was a victory, right there. Inconveniencing the able-bodied would take his
people where pity never could.
"Free our people!" the Gang of Nineteen shouted from all sides of the buses. "FREE OUR
PEOPLE!!"

Organizing this had been hard..
And yet, here we are, crushing it.
Police cruisers pulled up, lights flashing red
and blue. Ah, now it gets really interesting.
Officers meandered through the wheelchairs,
consulted with each other, and muttered into
their radios. Handcuffs swung from their
belts, but none reached for them.
Wade stood on the sidewalk.
The protesters started singing, "We shall overcome . . ." Eventually, an officer approached
the friends and family. One pointed at Wade. That was fine. He'd told them to.
The officer sauntered over. "What's going on?" he asked Wade. "They want accessible
buses."
"RTD has Handi-Ride. They can use that. Tell them."
"They want all buses accessible, so they can go where they want to go when they want to
go. All buses."
"They're blocking traffic."
"Yes, Officer. That's the point."
"Are you in charge, Mr. uh . . ."

"The Rev. Wade Blank. I'm just here to hand out water and help them."
"Well, they gotta disperse, or we'll arrest them."
"First, sir, a person who's severely disabled has the same right as you to pursue his/her
happiness. And if that means getting arrested in front of a bus, so be it. Second, it's not
going to come to that, is it? You're not going to arrest them." "Hmph."
"Because your jail's not wheelchair accessible."
The overarching mission of the Atlantis Community was, and still is, to provide as many of
life's necessities—the necessities often taken for granted by those who do not live life with
a physical or mental disability—as possible. Blank and those who resided at Atlantis
decided to form an activist group to garner as much attention as possible for disability
rights – ADAPT (American Disabled for Attendant ProgramsToday, once known as the
American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit). The members of this militant-style
activist group first focused on the Regional Transportation District (RTD), the origin of the
initial rallies, which drew major attention to the cause. ADAPT members traveled
nationwide, protesting the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and various
bus companies, like Greyhound, to get wheelchair lifts installed on buses. Many ADAPT
members were arrested during these protests, highlighting the lack of preparedness for
local police departments' inaccessible squad cars and facilities. Police officers erected
makeshift barriers to detain the ADAPT members in wheelchairs because they had no other
way of arresting and transporting the protestors. The second major wave of ADAPTprotests
targeted Social Security, health care policies, and Medicaid. Their ultimate goal was to
obtain government support for attendant care and independent living funds. Eventually,
ADAPT began protesting restaurants, schools, parking lots, post offices, housing
communities, casinos, churches, and more. Wherever wheelchairs could not go, ADAPT
was there to take action and demand access.
—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary: As you can read, the journey for civil rights for people with disabilities was and
is still a journey. While civil rights actions for other deserving populations were going on,
Denver played a pivotal role in changing policies that affect people with disabilities
throughout the country.
Wade Blank’s leadership and work in the civil rights actions for people with disabilities
helped pave the way for better education opportunities like IDEA, set the foundation for the
implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and many other standards that we
take for granted today. However, his biggest accomplishment was empowering people with

RTD Board of Directors:
We, the undersigned legislators, are writing to express our support for renaming Civic Center Station in honor of
Reverend Wade Blank, a pioneering leader in Denver's disability rights movement. Renaming the station in honor of
Reverend Blank would not only celebrate his legacy, but also serve as a lasting symbol of the progress he helped
achieve by breaking down barriers for people with disabilities.
Reverend Blank's contributions to disability rights and accessibility were monumental. As an ordained minister, he
spearheaded the American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) movement in 1975 to demand basic civil
rights for people with disabilities. Inspired by his participation in 1960s civil rights marches, Reverend Blank
courageously organized nonviolent protests like sit-ins to advance accessibility and independent living options.
When RTD refused to adequately address bus inaccessibility in the 1970s, Reverend Blank and a group known as
"The Gang of 19" led a two-day protest by surrounding buses at the Colorado State Capitol. This catalyzed RTD to
become the first transit agency in the nation to operate a fully accessible bus fleet, sparking change across the country.
Other cities have already renamed their transit stations in honor of pivotal civic rights leaders who have broken
barriers. Renaming a station after Reverend Blank in Denver would be a powerful affirmation of RTD's values of
diversity, inclusion, and expanding mobility for all. Additionally, highlighting his story aligns with RTD's mission of
serving all residents, regardless of ability.
The grassroots struggle for disability access led by Reverend Blank played a pivotal role in breaking down barriers
and transforming our community for the better. We urge you to support the proposal to rename Civic Center Station
in honor of Reverend Blank's legacy in expanding mobility and independence for people with disabilities.

Letter of Support
Renaming Civic Center Bus Terminal
Dear Community Partner,
In early 2024 Joe Beaver, a longtime advocate for the disability community, requested that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) rename Civic Center to Wade Blank.
Initial response was positive from the RTD Board, other elected oﬃcials and people familiar
with the impact Wade Blank has had on transportation and the independence of people with
disabilities, also provided positive support.
Though enthusiastic about the idea, the RTD Board of Directors realized that there was no
process documented that could help them with the legal and internal impacts of renaming its
properties. In 2024, the staﬀ at RTD and help with the Board of Directors developed and passed
a plan for renaming of RTD properties.
The ﬁrst set of applications, as you can guess, are to rename the Civic Center after Wade Blank.
One of the requirements needed to meet application requirements is to have local support for
the initiative. We are requesting that you support our eﬀorts. You can do this by simply
returning this email with your name as an endorser of your organization. You may also write a
letter of support with a description of how transportation supports your mission or helps
people that you advocate for becoming more independent.

Renaming Civic Center Bus Terminal
Dear Community Partner,

In early 2024 Joe Beaver, a longtime advocate for the disability community, requested that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) rename Civic Center to Wade Blank.
Initial response was positive from the RTD Board, other elected officials and people familiar
with the impact Wade Blank has had on transportation and the independence of people with
disabilities, also provided positive support.
Though enthusiastic about the idea, the RTD Board of Directors realized that there was no

process documented that could help them with the legal and internal impacts of renaming its
properties.

In 2024, the staff at RTD and help with the Board of Directors developed and passed

a plan for renaming of RTD properties.
The first set of applications, as you can guess, are to rename the Civic Center after Wade Blank.
One of the requirements needed to meet application requirements is to have local support for

the initiative. We are requesting that you support our efforts. You can do this by simply
returning this email with your name as an endorser of your organization. You may also write a
letter of support with a description of how transportation supports your mission or helps
people that you advocate for becoming more independent.

Proclamation No. 25-0604
Proclamation for the Renaming of Civic Center Station to Wade Blank Civic Center Station
WHEREAS. oublic transit is an essential lifeline that connects communities. facilitates access t0
healthcare, employment, education, and recreation, and fosters a vibrant, equitable city for all 11s
residents: and
WHEREAS, the Denver City Council is committed to ensuring that every citizen, regardless of
ability, has access to a robust, accessible transportation system that supports their daily lives and
enhances their mobility; and
WHEREAS, people with disabilities have historically faced significant barriers to accessible
transportation, and it is imperative that their rights to safe, reliable, and inclusive transit options be
fully recognized and upheld; and
WHEREAS. Reverend Wade Blank. the founder of ADAPT. established the first indeoendent livinq
center in Denver in 1975, laying the foundation for a national movement dedicated to advocating for
the civil rights of people with disabilities, including the right to accessible transportation, home
healthcare services, and independent living; and
WHEREAS, Wade Blank's pioneering efforts-such as the "Gang of 19" sit-in protest in 1978 that
led to Denver becoming the first city in the nation to provide accessible buses for people using
wheelchairs-sparked a nationwide movement for disability rights and accessibility in public transit;
and
WHEREAS. in addition to his leadership in ADAPT, Wade Blank's commitment to the disability
rights movement was informed by his earlier experiences as an ordained Presbyterian minister and
civil rights advocate, marching with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and standing aga[nst injustice at Kent
State University in 1971, experiences that fueled his passion for equality and social justice; and
WHEREAS, Denver became the national center of the disability rights movement, with Wade
Blank's activism directly influencing key policies, including the Home and Community-Based
Services Act of 1981 and the 1999 Olmstead Decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which
recognized the right of individuals with disabilities to live in the least restrictive environment possible;
and
WHEREAS, Wade Blank's lifelong work and ADAPT's non-violent direct actions set the standard for
one form of disability rights actions across the country, making cities more accessible and ensuring
that people with disabilities can live independently with dignity.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT PROCLAIMED BY THE DENVER CITY COUNCIL:
Section 1. That the Denver City Council wholeheartedly supports the renaming of Civic Center

HONORARY PROPERTY AND STATION NAMING PROCEDURES
ADOPTED: JULY 30, 2024
I.

OVERVIEW

Applications for an honorary property name are accepted on a rolling basis by the Board Office. Each year, the
Chair of the Board will convene the Honorary Property Name Proposal Review Committee (Review Committee)
no more than once. The Review Committee will then review, and rank the submissions received since the
committee was last convened. The Review Committee may or may not choose to support any of the proposals
submitted.
II.

STEPS

The following steps are to be followed when proposing, considering, and approving an honorary property name.
1. Submission of a complete honorary property name application to the Board of Directors by way of the
Board Office, which includes the following:
a. A summary of the contemplated honoree’s contributions, which addresses the potential honoree’s
contributions to transit locally and nationally, as well as provides an overview of the connection
of the individual, group, organization, or event to the property under consideration for an
honorary name.
b. Letters of support from a range of individuals, groups, and organizations in the adjacent
community, including but not limited to local business improvement districts, local economic
development agencies, local chambers of commerce, State legislators, members of Congress,
community organizations, schools, and civic clubs.
c. A formal resolution from either the local city council or board of county commissioners supporting
the name change. (Requirement “c.” only applies to facilities primarily serving customers such as
stations, park-n-rides, and transfer centers. It does not apply to maintenance or administrative
buildings.)
2. Following the receipt of an application packet, the Board Office Executive Manager shall notify the Board
of the receipt of a proposal and make the application available to Directors who wish to review it.
3. No more than once annually, the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors, in consultation with the GM/CEO,
shall empanel an eight-member Review Committee comprised of the following:
•
•

meetings, work with the Board Office to ensure appropriate preparation for the committee’s meetings,
and shall serve at the pleasure of the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors.
5. The members of the Review Committee will initially score the applications and determine which proposals
warrant further review.
6. The Review Committee will then meet publicly to review the top application packets and hear testimony
from the respective applicants.
7. The Review Committee will issue its final ranked results based on the associated rubric to the Executive
Committee. The Review Committee is not obligated to recommend or support any of the proposals. These
results will be presented as a Discussion Item by the Board Office Executive Manager at a meeting of the
Executive Committee.
8. For the top-ranked recommended proposal only, RTD staff will compile cost estimates and a timeline for
updating signage both on the property under consideration and throughout the transit network. By way
of an action of the Executive Committee, staff may be asked to prepare a cost estimate for one or more
additional proposals than what was recommended by the Review Committee.
9. The Board Office Executive Manager shall prepare a recommended action for the Board to consider. This
recommended action shall be accompanied by the full application packet for the top-ranked
recommended proposal, the Review Committee’s proposal ranking, staff’s timeline to update the property
signage and throughout the transit network, staff’s cost estimates to update signage, and an identified
external or internal source of funding to cover the costs of the name change by way of an action of the
Executive Committee, the Executive Manager may be directed to prepare a recommended action for one
or more additional proposals than what was recommended by the Review Committee.

HONORARY PROPERTY AND STATION NAMING REVIEW RUBRIC
ADOPTED: JULY 30, 2024
I.

PURPOSE

The rubric is designed to assist the Review Committee in its work to objectively and fairly evaluate proposals to
add an honorary name to an RTD property. An effective rubric should help the Review Committee be more
efficient and consistent in its review, while also signaling to potential applicants the committee’s expectations.
II.

CHANGES TO THE RUBRIC

The Board of Directors may change the rubric and encourages the Review Committee as well as public to provide
feedback on ways to improve the rubric on an on-going basis.
III. OVERVIEW
Evaluators are asked to review each application using the following rubric. Applications for honorary names
should be assessed relative to the application’s ability to convey the extent to which the proposed individual,
group or event has historical significance to RTD and/or transit, significant community support, and aligns with
RTD’s values. Each criterion is scored individually on a 1-7 scale, with the total points possible being 21.
Committee members scores will be aggregated and discussed before the committee invites those who submitted
top-scoring applications to meet with the committee to further discuss their proposals.

Board Bylaws Article VI: Committees of the Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states: “Each year
the newly elected Executive Committee will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other
standing committees based upon Director’s stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the
Board will ratify the selections.” Article VI Section 1 of the Bylaws was amended on July 30, 2024, to
provide: “In the event a committee vacancy arises after the Board’s ratification, the Chair of the Board
shall appoint a Director to fill the vacancy, subject to the ratification by the full Board. This appointment
shall take effect upon notification to the Board.”
A vacancy on the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee arose in late June and on July 10, 2025,
Chair Bouquet notified the Board that he had appointed Director Patrick O’Keefe to that Committee.
DISCUSSION
The Board is asked to ratify the Chair’s appointment of Director Patrick O’Keefe to the Operations,
Safety, and Security Committee for the remainder of 2025.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – July 2025

July 24, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2025 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Wednesday, June 18, 2025. This report was prepared on
July 15, 2025, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, July 24, 2025.
Federal
At the federal level, Congress passed, and President Trump signed, a reconciliation package related to
federal revenues and spending. Transportation funding was absent from the focus of the legislation. As
referenced in a prior Government Relations Report, the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee had included new revenue-raising fees that would have supported the Highway Trust Fund,
although that section was never included in the Senate’s bill and was ultimately left out of the final bill.

Packet Pg. 89

1.5.1

The fees included in the House version may be revisited in 2026 when Congress addresses
reauthorization of the surface transportation bill.
Currently, Congress is considering a recissions package that would cancel previously appropriated
funding approved by a prior Congress. The legislation likewise does not impact transportation funding
and mainly focuses on foreign aid as well as public broadcasting funding.
With regards to federal fiscal year (FFY) 2026 appropriations, the House Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development Subcommittee (THUD) marked up their bill, which was approved on a party-line vote
Monday, July 14, 2025. The bill cuts transit funding from the President’s budget recommendation, with
funding levels 8.3% below FFY2025 enacted levels and 13.9% below the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act authorized levels. The cuts came primarily from the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA)
Capital Investment Grant Program. No funding was cut from FTA formula grant programs, which is the
primary source of federal funding utilized by RTD. The FFY2026 THUD bill approved by the House
Subcommittee represents an opening bid that will inevitably be the subject of a negotiation with the
Senate prior to the end of the federal fiscal year on September 30, 2025. RTD staff will continue to
track developments and keep the Board informed of any impacts to the agency.
State
In state related matters, the Colorado Energy Office is working to procure services of a consultancy to
facilitate the RTD Accountability Committee (committee) created in SB25-161. The committee is tasked
with researching a few topics outlined in the legislation and is required to produce a report by January
30, 2026. No details have been made public at this time related to appointments to the Committee by
the Governor or legislative leaders but are expected to be announced by the end of July 2025.
Committee meetings are expected to begin in August 2025.
Lastly, RTD is required to report during the legislative interim to the Transportation Legislation Review
Committee (TLRC). The TLRC has released dates for its planned meetings, which will be held on August
25, September 9, and October 21, 2025. RTD staff will work with legislative staff to schedule RTD’s
report and will apprise the Board of the LRC’s work.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On June 20, 2025, RTD’s General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson, Transit Police
Commander Jonathan Hollaway, and Government Relations Officer Micheal Davies joined Vice Chair
O’Keefe and Director Chandler for a joint meeting of Arapahoe County Mayors, Commissioners, and City
Managers to provide an update and engage in a dialogue on RTD matters.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Semiannual Report on Director Engagement

July 24, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 1, 2025, the Board of Directors held its annual retreat during which the Board reached
consensus on three goals for the Board for 2025. One of those goals is to “expand engagement with
stakeholders to grow the number of communication channels between multiple communities and the
agency.” This goal remains a key focus of the Board.
To support the Board’s proactive approach to achieving this goal, the Board Office developed an
engagement tracking form for Directors. This tool, coupled with consistent reminders to complete the
form, ensures that each substantive engagement is recorded, demonstrating the Board’s commitment to
expanding communication channels.
In creating the 2025 Executive Committee work plan, Director Chris Nicholson requested a regular report
to the Executive Committee on Director engagement activities. Based on the data gathered from the
form, this report was compiled to honor the Committee’s work plan.
DISCUSSION
Board members submitted forms to track over 70 engagements from January 1, 2025, through June
30th, 2025. Additionally, the Board Office submitted over 30 additional engagements recorded in the
Board’s Two-Week Calendar. In total, members of the Board have participated in over 110 tracked
engagements during the 2025 calendar year.
Data was submitted by seven of 15 Directors, indicating that the total amount of Board engagement is
significantly higher than what has been recorded. Below is a summary of the tracked engagements, the
complete list is attached to this report.
Directors have engaged with over 50 unique civic, business development, and nonprofit organizations.
Board members have met with more than 80 different individuals including local, state, and federal
officials as well as nonprofit and community leaders, reflecting the Board’s commitment to engaging
with a wide range of stakeholders.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Semiannual Report on Director Requests

July 24, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
One of the primary functions of the Board Office is to assist Directors in obtaining answers to their
inquiries. In this regard the Board Office serves as a clearing house for Director requests and liaises with
the appropriate division or department to ensure an accurate and timely response.
Further the Board Operating Guidelines call for a semiannual update of the on the volume and nature of
requests being sent by the Board to staff. This discussion has been placed on the Executive Committee’s
work plan and the associated materials have been developed to honor the Board’s Operating Guidelines.
The Board Office last reported on Director requests in February of 2025.
DISCUSSION
The Board Office continues to experience a high volume of requests coming from Board members. And
the overall volume is up significantly relative to 2022; however, the number of requests and staff time
spent on requests is on pace to decline relative to 2024. In March of 2023, the Board Office transitioned
to a new tracking system based in RTD’s Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) system.
This new system greatly increased the Board Office’s ability to track and collect data on requests from
Board members.
The tables below and attached presentation provide an overview of the volume, nature, and sources of
requests. Data is through June 30, 2025.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Comprehensive Operations Analysis

July 16, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize a transfer of $3,500,000 from the unrestricted fund, approve the
scope summary for a solicitation, and authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her
designee, to enter into a contract for consulting services to conduct the 2026 Comprehensive
Operational Analysis (COA).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug Monroe, Manager, Corridor Planning (Operations)
Brian Welch, Senior Manager, Planning Technical Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
A COA is used by transit agencies to address changing travel patterns, regional growth, and mobility
needs in communities typically triennially. RTD’s COA ensures the agency effectively delivers bus and
rail services in a manner that supports its mission of making lives better through connections across the
entire service area.
In July 2022, the Board of Directors adopted the agency’s branded COA known as the System
Optimization Plan (SOP), with a planning horizon concluding in 2027. The SOP is a detailed evaluation of
travel patterns, demographics, and transit routes in the service area, and it includes recommended
modifications to RTD’s fixed-route services to better meet near-term mobility needs in the region. RTD’s
planned route reinstatements and modifications can be found in the SOP.
As is RTD’s established practice, service plan modifications will continue to be implemented three times
a year during service changes, which typically occur in January, May, and August/September.
In Q3 2025, RTD will commence efforts to conduct a new COA in 2026, focusing on future service
modifications and community needs. The process to complete an updated COA typically takes 18
months and incorporates feedback and input from customers, stakeholders, and the community.
The COA will analyze current and projected boardings, customer demand, front-line staffing levels, land
use, population growth, transit-oriented and housing developments, activity centers, and travel patterns.
The final COA will serve as RTD’s service development and delivery roadmap, ensuring the agency
remains efficient and responsive to community needs.

Packet Pg. 115

2.15.A

This budget transfer is requested so that procurement of a consultancy can commence in 2025, and the
project work can commence in early 2026.
DISCUSSION
If approved, staff will prepare a solicitation seeking consulting services to conduct the 2026 COA to
include the following primary tasks:
1. Project Management and Administration: The consultancy will control and manage the project
from start to finish.
2. Stakeholder Engagement: The consultancy will lead stakeholder engagement efforts to solicit the
opinions of the Board, staff, local municipalities, customers, and the general public. The public
hearings, as required, will also be conducted prior to any Board action.
3. Current System Assessment: The consultancy will evaluate the current fixed-route and demand
response system by analyzing the characteristics and performance of existing services. The
analysis will be reported to understand how services compare to each other and to industry
standards. The Current System Assessment will also analyze RTD’s operating and maintenance
facilities and Service Development Division policies.
4. Market Research, Market Segmentation, and Travel Demand Analysis: The consultancy will
provide a comprehensive analysis of who RTD’s current and potential customers are in order to
understand current ridership and inform decisions on future services. This will include the use of
location-based services data.
5. Framework and Strategies for Service Improvement: The consultancy will develop a framework
for improving service by presenting options for tradeoffs, service and network types, matching
travel markets and services, service design guidelines, utilizing transit priority measures, and
coordinating with non-RTD transit services.
6. Develop an Updated Transit Network: The consultancy will produce an updated transit fixed-route
and demand-response network informed by information and decisions from the previous tasks.
The updated transit network will include plans for phasing, workforce needs, infrastructure needs,
cooperating, and cost sharing with local jurisdictions, RTD operating policies, and impacts to
customers.
7. Title VI Compliance: The consultancy will ensure that all plans are compliant with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Staff expects the project to be completed within 18 months of contract execution.
The 2026 COA will provide RTD with a new service plan moving forward. The lasting socio-behavioral
shifts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding impacts of remote work on transit
demands are now better understood; evaluating transit service delivery under current conditions will
allow RTD to better address customer needs and allocate agency resources where they can have the
greatest impact.

Bus Stop Infrastructure and Accessibility Assessment
Contract Amendment

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to
execute a change order to the contract with Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates, Inc.
(Nelson\Nygaard) to facilitate the completion of enhanced scope of work elements for the Bus Stop
Infrastructure and Accessibility Assessment (Project) in the amount of $231,862, increasing the total
amount not to exceed from $608,772 to $840,634.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Delegation of Authority and Competitive Selection (Resolution
No.010, Series of 2022), the GM/CEO was authorized to enter a contract with Nelson\Nygaard on
September 25, 2024, to facilitate the Project. The original contract amount was $608,772, which falls
within GM/CEO purchasing and contracting authority. The change order increase from $608,772 to
$840,634 represents a 38% increase in the not-to-exceed amount. Resolution No.010 requires the
Board of Directors to approve contract amendments or change orders that exceed a cumulative total of
25% of the original contract amount.
As identified in the scope of work for the contract, the purpose of the Project is to develop a
comprehensive understanding of bus stop infrastructure within the RTD service area. Currently, RTD is
lacking a comprehensive, up-to-date dataset related to bus stops. The Project has also engaged local
stakeholders who have responsibilities for bus stops, since more than 96% of the stops within RTD’s
service area are controlled by others, including local jurisdictions, private property owners, and
advertising entities. The purpose of engaging local stakeholders is to develop a systemwide strategy for
enhanced investment in bus stop infrastructure and a more coordinated approach to bus stop
management and maintenance. The specific scope elements included in the contract are as follows:
Task 1 - Project Management and Administration
• Regular coordination with the RTD project management team and Planning Advisory Group
(PAG) and management of the subconsultants

Packet Pg. 118

2.15.B

Task 2 - Existing Conditions and Best Practices
• Analyze current practices regarding RTD’s transit amenities and service delivery
• Review other agencies’ bus stop infrastructure and amenities programs
Task 3 - Bus Stop Inventory and Gap Analysis
• Conduct extensive data collection on bus stop amenities, accessibility, right-of-way
ownership, and maintenance responsibilities
Task 4 - Implementation and Prioritization Strategy
• Establish bus stop typologies to organize and standardize levels of bus stop
amenities/investment
• Develop criteria to prioritize bus stop improvements
Task 5 - Governmental Stakeholder Outreach and Coordination
• Engage governmental stakeholders to improve coordination and establish a regional bus stop
improvement framework
Task 6 - Final Report
The expected completion of the Project is slated to occur in Q1 2026. Staff plans to provide an update
on the progress of the Project to the Finance and Planning Committee no later than November 2025.
Currently, the focus of the Project is on data collection under Task 3.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. The purpose of this action is to ensure the successful
completion of the Project.
Enhanced scope items are required above what was anticipated in the original scope of work. These
additional items were requested by staff to ensure successful completion of the Project. There are
several areas where additional scope has been completed or will be completed, including:
•

Improved Internal Staff Feedback Collection and Coordination – Outside of administrative tasks
and project oversight, the current scope for Task 1 (Project Management and Administration) only
includes Consultant assistance with internal coordination to collect input from staff across
numerous business units via meetings or interviews as appropriate. The scale of this Project
requires more in-depth participation and feedback from staff identified as subject matter experts
to inform key Project deliverables, including the existing conditions and best practices memo
under Task 2, the data collection plan for Task 3, and a proposed methodology for prioritization
and implementation of bus stop improvements under Task 4. To achieve this objective, the RTD
project management team determined six Project Advisory Group (PAG) meetings will need to be
conducted and facilitated by Nelson\Nygaard. The PAG includes RTD representatives who deal
directly with bus stops from Bus Operations, Service Development, Asset Management, and

Packet Pg. 119

2.15.B

Capital Programs. The proposed change would increase the fee from $54,275 to $95,955 for an
additional fee of $41,680.
•

Right-Sized Data Collection Approach – Task 3 (Bus Stop Inventory and Gap Analysis) was
identified in the scope of work as the largest and most critical task of the Project. It was also
clarified in the original project scope that "RTD will review the scope of data collection before a
final notice to proceed is signed to ensure that the scale of the data collection effort is
commensurate with the available budget." Prior to the contract notice to proceed, the RTD
project management team agreed to defer the question on the scope of the data collection until
Nelson\Nygaard formally developed a data collection plan with the support of the project
management team and the PAG. The data collection plan has been developed and articulated that
a significant increase in budget for the data collection task is justified. After reviewing RTD's
existing bus stop data, Nelson\Nygaard with support from the RTD project management team
concluded that imagery should be collected for all bus stops versus imagining only a subset of
stops. This proposed change increased the task budget from $268,820 to $397,090, for a total
increase of $128,270.

•

Optimized Governmental and Stakeholder Outreach – The RTD project management team
determined that adding eight additional county workshops to the Project is critical to garner
additional buy in from external stakeholders on a regional framework for investment in bus stops.
This additional scope was not added to the original contract signed by Nelson\Nygaard in
September 2024 and was deferred for future consideration. The need for eight additional
workshops was determined to be the optimal amount after further discussion between
Nelson\Nygaard and the RTD project management team. The RTD project management team is
proposing to add this additional scope at this time. The proposed budget for Task 5 would be
changed from $54,204 to $116,116, for a total increase of $61,912.

Summary of Contract Amendment
The costs for the enhanced and additional scope are summarized below:
Task 1 – Project Management
$41,680
Task 3 – Bus Stop Inventory and Gap Analysis
$128,270
Task 5 – Governmental and Stakeholder Outreach
$61,911
Total:
$231,862
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this change order in the amount of $231,862 would come from the unallocated Project
funds originally approved in the 2025 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project Progressive Design
Build Contract Award

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to enter
into a progressive design-build (PDB) contract with Flatiron Dragados-Herzog Downtown Rail Joint
Venture (FDHJV) for the remaining phases of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project (DRRP),
consisting of design and full-depth reconstruction of light rail tracks from 7th Street and West Colfax
Avenue to 30th Street and North Downing Street in an amount not to exceed $125,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Central Corridor (Corridor) is the oldest rail segment in the agency’s light rail system, having
opened for revenue service on Friday, October 7, 1994. The Corridor extends 5.3 miles from I25·Broadway Station to 30th·Downing Station. With the Corridor approaching its 30th year in continuous
revenue service, several paved track segments along the Corridor require full-depth reconstruction, and
associated rail infrastructure requires replacement as part of long-term operations and maintenance of
RTD’s assets to improve safety and mobility, address aging transit infrastructure, and extend the design
life of the agency’s key transportation assets.
Maintaining the agency’s assets in a state of good repair through sound asset management principles
furthers RTD’s Strategic Initiative of Back to Basics. These principles involve identifying, funding, and
implementing projects to replace assets as they meet their expected useful life.
DISCUSSION
As presented to the Board by the GM/CEO at the March 25 and June 24, 2025, Board meetings,
respectively, RTD is completing the DRRP in four phases. Phase 1 was successfully completed in
September 2024 and focused on track reconstruction at five key intersections in downtown Denver.
Under the PDB contract, FDHJV will perform design and construction work required to replace the rail
and associated substructure and upgrade certain stations in downtown Denver from 7th Street and West
Colfax Avenue to 30th Avenue and North Downing Street (Phases 2 through 4), except for the Kalamath
Street portion of Phase 3, which will be performed under a separate contract authorized by the Board on
June 24, 2025.

Packet Pg. 122

2.15.C

The approximately 10,000 linear feet of track and crossing replacement will complete the track
replacement through these corridors and limit the need for future disruption of service for required
maintenance.
Design for this work is anticipated to commence immediately upon execution of the PDB contract with
construction of Phases 2 and 3 anticipated to be completed by August 2026 and construction of Phase
4 anticipated to be completed by September 2027.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
Solicitation Overview
On December 2, 2024, RTD advertised a solicitation for a PDB contractor to complete the DRRP.
Proposals were received April 7, 2025.
After evaluation of responsive proposals based upon the published evaluation criteria, a seven-member
technical proposal evaluation panel and a three-member cost proposal panel scored the proposals.
FDHJV was the highest scoring proposer and is recommended for award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract, in an amount not to exceed $125,000,000, is included in the 2025 Budget.
RTD has submitted a Congressionally Directed Spending/Community Project grant application to the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for $4,850,000 to supplement this RTD funding. This award, if
received from the FTA, will be used for the design of Phases 2 and 3.

East Metro Hoists Replacement Contract Award

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with A.D. Miller Services, Inc., for the replacement of 15 bus hoists at the East Metro Bus
Storage and Maintenance Facility for a total not-to-exceed amount of $5,639,130.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the agency’s asset management renewal process, staff identified 15 original bus hoists that
have met their useful life and require replacement. These hoists were installed during the building’s
construction in 1977, and the existing hoists have been repaired and had parts replaced for more than
45 years.
The hoists will be replaced with new scissors and platform lifts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success.
On March 27, 2025, RTD issued a solicitation for a contractor to complete the Hoist Replacement
project based on prepared plans and specifications. Proposals were due on May 23, 2025. The
evaluation committee recommends A.D. Miller Services, Inc., as the most qualified proposer.
Should the Board approve this recommendation, the contractor will phase installation of the lifts to
accommodate maintenance operations. The project is expected to be completed within 18 months
following contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Up to $2,829,048.00 of the costs of this project will be paid for through a Colorado Department of
Transportation award. The remaining cost will be funded from existing capital improvement dollars
allocated in the 2025 Budget.

US-36 and Sheridan Bus Platform Expansion Contract
Award

July 15, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Krische Construction, Inc., for the expansion of the eastbound US-36 and Sheridan Station
bus boarding platform from four to eight bus bays for a total not-to-exceed amount of $3,321,093.62.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The existing eastbound bus boarding platform at US-36 and Sheridan Station is configured to include
four straight bus bays that serve all eastbound Flatiron Flyer (FF) trips in addition to local routes. When
all routes are running at capacity, the limited amount of bus bays is insufficient, resulting in operational
inefficiencies and impacts to service.
With this project, the bus loading plaza will grow from the current four, straight bus bays to eight bus
bays total (six sawtooth and two straight). The addition of four sawtooth bus bays and the
reconfiguration of two of the existing straight bus bays to sawtooth bus bays will result in an increase in
operational efficiency, ease of use by RTD bus operators, and improved customer orientation and
experience. The additional bus bays will provide for sufficient capacity for local and FF bus services as
identified in the System Optimization Plan. A new, separate Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant
accessible ramp with adjacent stairs will be constructed for better access to the newly configured bus
platform from the Park-n-Ride lot.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership.
On May 20, 2025, RTD issued an invitation for bids for a contractor to complete the bus platform
reconfigurations based on prepared plans and specifications. Bids were due on June 24, 2025. Krische
Construction, Inc., submitted the lowest responsive and responsible bid.
The project is expected to be completed within six months following the contract award.

Packet Pg. 152

2.15.E

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Up to $1.5 million of the cost will be paid for through a Colorado Department of Transportation grant
administered through the Funding Advancement for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery
(FASTER) initiative. The remaining cost will be funded from existing capital improvement dollars
allocated in the 2025 Budget.

development of a new bus operations facility. A new facility has been identified in the agency’s longrange plans for several years. Reimagine RTD, a long-range comprehensive operational analysis
completed in 2022, analyzed RTD’s existing bus operations facilities and determined that the facilities
were not adequate to meet the growing needs of the Denver region. Additionally, RTD’s 2024 Facilities
and Fleet Transition Plan (FFTP) assessed RTD-owned property for its ability to accommodate a new
operations facility. This project will build on prior work and include a facility alternatives analysis and a
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)-level environmental planning review for RTD’s next bus
operations facility. Completion of the NEPA process will allow the facility to be eligible for future federal
funding.
DISCUSSION
The scope summary includes the following primary tasks:
1. Project Management and Administration: The contractor will maintain overall management and
control of the project from start to finish.
2. Alternatives Analysis: The contractor will analyze up to five sites, plus a no-build scenario, for
suitability of a new bus operations facility. The contractor will conduct a thorough alternatives
analysis.
3. NEPA Documentation: The contractor will complete the NEPA process, including necessary
documentation and public involvement, to ensure environmental compliance.

4. Stakeholder/Public Engagement: The contractor will conduct engagement with stakeholders and
with the public necessary to advance the study.
5. Preliminary Engineering: Concurrent with the NEPA process, the contractor will create space
programming and preliminary design plans for the selected site, sufficient to support the NEPA
process and inform future design phases.
6. Funding Strategy: Funding for construction has not yet been identified; accordingly, the
contractor will develop a strategy for acquiring the funding necessary to advance the project
through construction.
7. FFTP Reassessment: Using the completed FFTP as a building block, the contractor will assess
how a new bus operations facility will integrate into RTD’s transition plan.
Staff expects the facility alternatives and NEPA study to be completed within two years of contract
execution.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the study is included in the Board-adopted 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
August 2025 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 16, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the August
2025 service change to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The service change proposed for August 2025 facilitates opportunities for bus and rail operators to
select new work shift assignments and for Service Development to adjust the overall operations plan for
the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD System Optimization
Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect SOP implementation to provide the best
possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on Black Indigenous People of Color
(BIPOC) and low-income populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior
to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change
threshold to determine whether those changes will result in adverse effects. The August 2025 service

Packet Pg. 158

2.15.G

change recommendation includes nine major service changes out of 58 total changes. Thus, an analysis
is required to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 28, 2025, the Board adopted the 20252028 Title VI Program Update including updates to these policies. Collectively, these policies provide the
foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: defined as a 25% or greater change in service hours, route miles
(including re-routes), daily service span, or frequency of any bus route or rail line within a single
service proposal or cumulatively in any period within 36 consecutive months; the implementation
of a new route/line; and the elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an existing route/line.
All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
• RTD defines “adverse effect” as any impact on transit services resulting from major
service changes, such as service decreases, route modifications, schedule adjustments, or
other modifications, that may:
o Disproportionately burden Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and/or
low-income populations compared to non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income
populations, or
o Disproportionately benefit non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations as
compared to BIPOC and/or low-income populations
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect BIPOC populations
10% more than non-BIPOC populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
200% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 52 bus routes (and related patterns) and six rail lines in the forthcoming
service change recommendation. Of these changes, nine services have proposed additions or reductions
to service 25% greater than that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major
service change. Those routes are shown in the following table.

Packet Pg. 159

2.15.G

Service Decrease

29, 30, 35

*Route 35 appears in both the service increase and service decrease sections because the proposed change
includes increased service frequency and a reroute. Likewise, Route 30 includes a segment extension and a
segment discontinuance.

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group, and system level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income. This analysis uses demographic data from the Census Bureau’s
American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2019 to 2023 at the census block group
geographic level.
The assessment also included data from its 2024 systemwide onboard survey, which included 18,285
weekday responses (66% bus, 33% rail), weighted to reflect 170,000 average weekday rides.
Systemwide, BIPOC customers made up 56% of boardings and low-income customers 52%, both higher
than district averages from the 2019–2023 ACS (38.2% BIPOC, 20.3% low-income).
Routes were classified as having a greater, moderate, or lesser share of BIPOC or low-income customers
based on their percentage point difference from system averages. Only routes with statistically valid
sample sizes were used in equity comparisons. Valid ridership data supplemented population-based
analysis and helped assess potential adverse impacts of proposed service changes.
Additionally, RTD quantifies the impacts of proposed changes on Access to Jobs and Key Activity
Centers, including jobs, retail/convenience stores, human and social service providers, senior facilities,
and educational institutions. Jobs is derived from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) 2022 dataset. Key Activity Centers uses two data
sources: Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Business Analyst 2022-2023 and Denver
Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) Regional Data 2024.
Summary of Findings:
Potential disparate impacts and/or disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route level
for the following six routes:
•

Route 29: A higher percentage of the District’s BIPOC population (0.68%) stands to be negatively
impacted more from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the non-BIPOC
population (0.37%). A higher percentage of the District’s low-income population (0.78%) stands
to be negatively impacted more from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the
non-low-income population (0.42%). Further, the route-level ridership data show that 69% of
boardings are by BIPOC customers, indicating a greater concentration of BIPOC customers on the
route. The onboard survey route-level analysis also shows that 82% of boardings are by lowincome customers; however, the sample size for this group is too small to be considered
statistically valid.

Packet Pg. 160

2.15.G

•

Route 30: A higher percentage of the District’s BIPOC population (0.54%) stands to be impacted
negatively more from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the non-BIPOC
population (0.36%). The route-level ridership data show that 66% of boardings are by BIPOC
customers, indicating a greater concentration of BIPOC customers on the route. Additionally,
76% of boardings are by low-income customers, also indicating a greater concentration of lowincome customers.

•

Route 35: A higher percentage of the District’s low-income population (0.38%) stands to be
impacted negatively more from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the non-lowincome population (0.31%). The route-level ridership data show that 64% of boardings are by
BIPOC customers, indicating a greater concentration of BIPOC customers on the route.
Additionally, 60% of boardings are by low-income customers, indicating a moderate
concentration of low-income customers.

•

Route 135: A lower percentage of the District’s low-income population (0.54%) stands to benefit
less from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population
(0.79%). The route-level ridership data show that 64% of boardings are by BIPOC customers,
indicating a greater concentration of BIPOC customers. The onboard survey shows that 41% of
boardings are by low-income customers; however, the sample size is too small to be considered
statistically valid.

•

Route FF2: A lower percentage of the District’s BIPOC population (0.71%) stands to benefit less
from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.95%). The
route-level ridership data show that 43% of boardings are by BIPOC customers, indicating a
lesser concentration of BIPOC customers. Additionally, 37% of boardings are by low-income
customers, indicating a lesser concentration of low-income customers.

•

Route FF4: A lower percentage of the District’s BIPOC population (0.64%) stands to benefit less
from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.82%). The
route-level ridership data show that 43% of boardings are by BIPOC customers, indicating a
lesser concentration of BIPOC customers. Additionally, 37% of boardings are by low-income
customers, indicating a lesser concentration of low-income customers.

The proposed major service changes were also examined in aggregate, at the system level, to determine
overall impacts to equity populations compared to non-equity populations.
•

For system-level service increases, BIPOC populations stand to benefit more than non-BIPOC
populations (7.58% vs. 5.87%, respectively). This difference does not meet the disparate impact
threshold of 5.28%. Therefore, there is no system-level disparate impact finding with the
proposed major service increases. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-lowincome populations (9.32% vs. 5.69%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 5.12%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden
is found with the proposed major service increases.

Packet Pg. 161

2.15.G

•

For system-level service decreases, BIPOC populations stand to benefit less than non-BIPOC
populations (0.85% vs. 0.70%, respectively). This difference meets the disparate impact
threshold of 0.77%. Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the
proposed major service decrease. Low-income populations stand to benefit slightly less than nonlow-income populations (0.82% vs. 0.74%, respectively). The difference does meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 0.81%. Therefore, a system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service decrease.

Conclusions:
There are no system-level disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens for the eight major service
increases. BIPOC populations received 1.71% more of a benefit compared to non-BIPOC areas.
Moreover, low-income populations received 3.63% more benefit than non-low-income populations.
Although several route-level and system-level findings indicate potential disparate impacts and
disproportionate burdens, RTD recommends proceeding with the August 2025 service change as
proposed. This recommendation is grounded in fair and equitable distribution of transit services,
alignment with the Board-approved SOP, substantial legitimate justification, and the absence of practical
alternatives that would achieve the same objectives with fewer impacts to BIPOC or low-income
communities.
Among the proposed changes, one route, 29, initially presented potential equity concerns. However,
these are effectively mitigated through complementary service redesigns. Route 29 is set to be fully
replaced by Route 30, preserving existing coverage and frequency. These adjustments help maintain
access to key destinations and minimize the risk of inequitable outcomes.
The proposed elimination to the western segment of Route 30 results in a disparate impact finding at the
route level. The proposed reroute to Route 35 will help minimize the impact by replacing most of the
eastbound service from Wadsworth/Hampden PnR to West Yale Avenue/South Hooker Street before
heading south on Federal Boulevard. However, two of the five stops between West Dartmouth
Ave/South Raleigh St and South Lowell Blvd/West Linvale Place exceed a quarter mile of available
service, which provides a degree of concern as these stops will not have any replacement service. Per
the disparate impact policy, RTD shall consider modifications to the proposed change to ensure it avoids,
minimizes, or mitigates the impact. At this juncture, the proposed reroute does not provide practical
alternatives to continue service to these stops or avoid these potential impacts.
The proposed reroute of Route 35 results in a disproportionate burden due to the loss of coverage in
specific areas. Route 76 will help minimize the impact by providing an alternative service option from
Southwest Plaza to South Wadsworth Boulevard/West Mansfield Avenue as well as westbound from
West Jefferson Avenue/ South Wadsworth Boulevard to Southwest Plaza. However, five of the 11
eastbound stops between West Jefferson/South Wadsworth Boulevard to West Dartmouth
Avenue/South Sheridan Boulevard exceed a quarter mile of available service, which provides a degree of
concern as these stops will not have any replacement service. Per the disproportionate burden policy,
RTD will consider modifying the proposal to mitigate the impact where practicable. At this juncture, the
proposed reroute does not provide practical alternatives to continue service to these stops or avoid these
potential impacts.

2.15.G

Of the 58 total proposed service changes, nine qualify as major service increases. Seven of these serve
areas with high concentrations of BIPOC customers, and eight serve areas with high concentrations of
low-income customers. The observed benefit differences in the route-level analysis are relatively small—
ranging from 0.16% to 0.75%—and do not indicate systemic inequities. While some route-level findings
suggest potential concerns, these are addressed through broader network-level planning decisions,
including route consolidation, targeted enhancements to underserved areas, and improved frequencies.
Taken together, the proposed August 2025 service change advances the agency’s 2021–2026 Strategic
Plan Priority of delivering Community Value, while ensuring continued compliance with Title VI federal
regulations. RTD will continue to monitor and assess equity implications for future service proposals, and
where appropriate, propose adjustments to promote fair and inclusive transit outcomes.
Based on the full analysis, while isolated disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens have been
identified, RTD finds that the service plan does not result in an overall inequitable distribution of benefits
or burdens. Impacts have either been mitigated through complementary service changes or are supported
by substantial legitimate justification aligned with agency goals. RTD recommends proceeding with the
August 2025 service changes as proposed and remains committed to monitoring these areas and
engaging communities to identify future adjustments where feasible.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the August 2025 runboard to
ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and lowincome populations. A major service change is defined as a 25% or greater change in service hours, route miles
(including re-routes), daily service span, or frequency of any bus route or rail line within a single service proposal
or cumulatively in any period within 36 consecutive months;1 the implementation of a new route/line; and the
elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an existing route/line.
RTD’s Title VI Program defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate impacts (DI), and
disproportionate burdens (DB). All major service changes are subject to an equity analysis that includes
examining adverse effects. RTD analyzes the route and block group levels to identify any potential disparities in
service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
In the forthcoming runboard, RTD proposes changes to 52 bus routes (and related patterns) and six rail
lines. Of these changes, nine meet established thresholds for a major service change:
Route 30: Southbound trips of Route 30 extended from Federal/Evans to Littleton/Downtown
Station, as well as matching headways as described in the System Optimization Plan: weekday
service from 4:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m., while Saturday and Sunday service would operate 5:00 a.m.
to 1:00 a.m. This recommendation replaces Route 29 with no loss in coverage or frequency.
Route 35: Trips between Federal/Evans and Wadsworth/Hampden Park-and-Ride rerouted,
covering areas no longer served by Route 30 due to its extension to Littleton/Downtown Station.
Service frequency increased to 30 minutes for most of the day. Additionally, seasonal tripper
service on the Route 30 replaced with a concurrent tripper on Route 35, covering the same area
and time as the previously discontinued seasonal tripper service.

Service
Increase

Route 36: Schedule adjustments to establish consistent hourly headway during all hours of
operation.
Route 135: Peak period service frequency increased (a.m. and p.m. peaks) to 30 minutes. Base
period service to remain at 60-minute frequency.
Route 327: Hours of operation extended on weekdays and Saturdays to 7:00 p.m., while also
making minor changes to schedule. The change addresses needs of transit-dependent workers
in Longmont, matches operation hours of Routes 324 and 326, allows for improved connections,
and improves on-time performance.
Route LX2: Three southbound morning peak and two evening peak trips added, as well as two
northbound morning peak and three evening peak trips, per the System Optimization Plan (SOP).
Route FF2: Three eastbound morning peak and two evening peak trips added, as well as
westbound two morning peak and three evening peak trips, to address occurring overloads,
between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. as well as 4:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on weekdays.
Route FF4: Route FF4 reinstated by adding four peak period trips in each direction.
Route 29: With the implementation of changes to the Route 30, Route 29 eliminated and
replaced by extended trips on the Route 30 – South Federal.

Service
Route 30: Service to Bear Valley via Dartmouth discontinued; instead, service continues straight
Decrease along Federal Blvd between Colfax Ave and Littleton Downtown Station.
Route 35: Route 35 south of Wadsworth/Hampden truncated to eliminate service duplication to
Long/Bowles.

Findings
1. No system-level DI or DB finding for the eight major service increases.
2. Two out of the eight major service increases resulted in a potential DI, and one resulted in a potential DB at
the route level.
3. System-level DI and DB finding for the two major service decreases. Specifically, a slightly greater percentage
of BIPOC populations are more likely to be negatively impacted from the decreases than non-BIPOC
populations (0.85% vs. 0.70%, respectively). Likewise, a slightly greater percentage of low-income
populations are more likely to be negatively impacted from the decreases than non-low-income populations
(0.82% vs. 0.74%, respectively).

Introduction
Title VI
The mission of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is to make lives better through connections, and its
vision is to be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to our customers and community.
Title VI and equity are central to this mission and vision. An equitable mass transit system ensures that the
benefits and burdens of service are distributed fairly, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income level.
This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior
to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, and
to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on populations comprising
BIPOC or low-income populations.
RTD has prepared this equity analysis to document changes that are proposed to occur between the current and
proposed service change packages. These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the
route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the communities RTD
serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to RTD’s transit services. These changes
include the addition of service hours, route miles (including re-routes), daily service span, or frequency;
implementation of a new route or line; and the elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an existing
route/line. RTD has established principles to identify the service changes needed to meet the diverse travel
needs of those within the service area and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•
•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected customers
Cost-effective distribution throughout the service area and Family of Services and the ability
to enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and BIPOC
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (Family of Services) depending on service type, route/line
alignment, and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes/lines within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with state law, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics
used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify
a series of service changes.

…The general assembly further finds that the service area should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the service area should consider leastcost alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

Colorado Revised Statutes §32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios – Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a major service change policy, a DI policy, and a DB
policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service and fare change
proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
•

•

•
•

Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% or greater change in service hours,
route miles (including re-routes), daily service span, or frequency of any bus route or rail line within a
single service proposal or cumulatively in any period within 36 consecutive months2; the implementation
of a new route/line; and the elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an existing route/line. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
o RTD defines “adverse effect” as any impact on transit services resulting from major service
changes, such as service decreases, route modifications, schedule adjustments, or other
modifications, that may:
▪ Disproportionately burden BIPOC and/or low-income populations compared to non-BIPOC
and/or non-low-income populations, or
▪ Disproportionately benefit non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations as compared to
BIPOC and/or low-income populations
Any service change that does not meet the above criteria for a major service change is considered a
minor service change. Additionally, the following exceptional cases are exempt:
o Discontinuance of service that is replaced by a different mode or operator, provided the new
service offers the same or better headways, fare, transfer options, span of service, and stops
served
o Standard seasonal or schedule adjustments, unless the adjustments, as compared to operations
during the previous season, falls within the major service change definition above
o Emergency service changes, including changes in routes or service frequencies, which may be
necessitated due to a state of fiscal emergency or a major catastrophe (e.g., natural or humanmade disasters) which severely impairs public health or safety, changes in access to public streets,
or the ability of RTD vehicles to travel on public streets
o Service changes (e.g., detours) due to roadway or rail infrastructural projects undertaken by
external stakeholders (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation, City and County of
Denver) that would remain in effect for 12 months or less
o Creation, alteration, or elimination of a supplemental, temporary, or demonstration service that
would remain in effect for 12 months or less
o Adjustments made to major service changes after Board approval but prior to the effective date
that would otherwise be considered minor changes
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a BIPOC population 10
percent more than non-BIPOC populations; this level of impact is considered a DI.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a DB. A lowincome population is a group of households who are at or below 200% of the Department of Health and
Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

If a proposed major service change results in a DI, RTD shall consider modifications to the proposed change to
ensure it avoids, minimizes, or mitigates the potential DI. A major service change that results in a DI can only
be implemented if:
1. There is a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed major service change, and
2. There are no alternatives that would have a less DI while still accomplishing RTD’s legitimate program
goals
If a proposed major service change results in a DB, RTD will consider modifying the proposal to mitigate the
impact where practicable.

Public Outreach Overview
RTD conducted a comprehensive outreach effort to promote its public meetings and gather feedback on the
proposed changes. The Transit Equity Office and its contracted partners engaged 735 community members at
19 events tailored to historically underserved communities across the RTD service area. Contractors also
promoted the meetings via social media, reaching 1,231 individuals, and through newsletters opened by 6,330
recipients.
To further raise awareness, RTD issued three news releases in English and Spanish to 720 regional media outlets
and general recipients, distributed the June Read-n-Ride newsletter to 992 subscribers, conducted email
outreach to the Transportation Management Associations, and delivered five presentations on the proposed
changes to Subregional Service Councils.
Additionally, the Communications and Engagement Department and the Americans with Disabilities Act Office
emailed 32 and ten community-based organizations and key activity centers, respectively — such as senior
housing facilities, affordable housing communities, schools, places of worship, and government social service
agencies.
To ensure transparency and provide a forum for public input, RTD also hosted two public meetings on June 16,
2025, and one “Ask a Service Planner” meeting on June 17, 2025, with a total of 25 attendees. Table 1
summarizes the feedback themes received on major service changes from these meetings and from individual
route surveys.

Concerns centered around maintaining adequate coverage, with many noting that previous
service reductions have already made commuting difficult. Suspending Route 29 is seen as an
unnecessary cut that would negatively impact transit-dependent customers who rely on this
service.
Customers expressed concern that the proposed rerouting would cut off access to key
destinations like Hampden and Wadsworth Park-n-Ride, Bear Valley, Sheridan, and
Wadsworth. This change would require additional transfers, namely to Route 35, and increase
travel time. Commenters stressed that the affected area includes many transit-dependent
customers. Some proposed alternatives, such as turning Route 31 into a full Federal crosstown
line, to improve north-south service without removing Route 30’s east-west connections. While
a few supported simplifying the route and boosting frequency during peak hours, most
emphasized the need to preserve existing access without added transfers.
Many respondents supported increased frequency and better connections to light rail and
major intersections but raised concerns about losing service along the Hampden frontage road
and to Fort Logan, areas with high transit dependence. Commenters urged RTD to maintain
existing service to key destinations like Southwest Plaza and to update outdated signage that
may mislead customers.
Commenters emphasized the need for more frequent service during peak hours, suggesting
30-minute intervals instead of the current 60-minute schedule. They appreciated that the route
reduces the need for transfers and wanted to maintain that convenience.
Comments emphasized that increasing the Route 135’s frequency to every 30 minutes during
peak hours is helpful but insufficient, with many advocating for consistent 30-minute service
throughout the day to make the route more reliable and appealing.
Commenters wanted extended service hours in Longmont, requesting buses to run until 10
p.m. Monday through Saturday and until 8 p.m. on Sundays, especially during the summer.
They emphasized that these changes would better align with work schedules and expand
transit options. Sunday service was highlighted as a missing but valuable addition.
Customers expressed strong support for restoring direct Longmont–Denver express service,
highlighting the LX2 as a valuable option that improves regional connectivity and reduces
commute times, particularly for residents of Niwot and Longmont. Several commenters
requested more frequent trips throughout the day, especially during reverse-peak hours, and
noted that current schedules may not align with early work shifts.
Respondents overwhelmingly supported the expansion of FF2 service, emphasizing its
importance in reducing travel time, alleviating overcrowding, and providing more flexible and
reliable commuting options between Boulder and Denver. Many noted that current buses are
often at capacity during peak hours, with standing-room-only conditions that pose safety and
accessibility concerns. Increased frequency, especially during mornings, evenings, and beyond

Route FF4

peak periods, is seen as essential for supporting working families, students, and low-income
customers.
Public feedback strongly supported restoring the FF4 route, with many noting it will
significantly reduce commute times to Civic Center, eliminate the need for transfers at Union
Station, and encourage a return to public transit. Respondents highlighted the importance of
reconnecting Boulder Junction to downtown Denver. Several also requested earlier departures
and increased frequency to better meet demand and accommodate diverse schedules.

RTD also allows the public to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com, by phone at 303-299-2004,
and by fax at 303-299-2227.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

RTD calculates the net change in service hours, route miles (including re-routes), daily service span or frequency,
the implementation of a new route or line, and the elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an existing
route/line for each proposal made either at one time or cumulatively over a 36-month period. Any change
meeting or exceeding a 25% difference from baseline service levels is flagged as a major service change and
subject to further equity analysis.

Major Service Change Test
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (based on trips, hours, miles,
implementation of a new route or line; or the elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an
existing route/line) of 25% or more, made at one time or cumulatively over a 36-month period.

For each major service change, RTD categorizes affected routes or lines as either “equity” or “non-equity” based
on the demographic characteristics of their service areas in the current network. A proportional equity analysis
is conducted to evaluate whether the proposed change disproportionately affects equity populations. This
involves comparing the proportion of BIPOC and low-income populations within each impacted route or line’s
service area to the service areawide proportions of those same populations. If the analysis identifies that an
equity population within a service area would experience service impacts 10% or greater than non-equity
populations, the route or line is flagged for a potential finding of DI (for BIPOC populations) or DB (for lowincome populations).
The proportional analysis uses demographic data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS)
5-Year Estimates for years 2019 to 2023 at the census block group geographic level. Other data related to the
analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into a servicegeographic-demographic combination relates populations with changes in service at a geographic level to aid in
reviewing potential impacts to service area equity communities, which include BIPOC and low-income
populations.
BIPOC status includes all populations identifying as non-white and/or Hispanic or Latine. Low-income status
within the service area is based on ACS population estimates and defined as households at or below 200% of
the federal poverty level, adjusted for local context—equivalent to an annual income of $53,300 for a family of
three. The service area is based on the collection of block groups wholly or partially within service area
boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population within that buffer. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block
group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block
group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics remain unchanged).
This analysis also uses ridership data from RTD’s 2024 systemwide onboard customer survey (onboard survey),
which provides a snapshot of weekday trip characteristics across 99 bus routes and 10 rail lines with 18,285
customer responses (excluding visitors). The survey resulted in 66% sample of trips for bus and 33% sample

for rail. Data is weighted3 to the estimated weekday ridership of 170,000 originating rides based on the
September 2024 runboard. Customer demographics by boardings were examined to determine service area
averages for BIPOC and low-income customers. Results indicate BIPOC customers accounted 56% of boardings
and low-income customers accounted for 52% of boardings. Comparing this to the 2019-2023 ACS, the
customers in this sample are well above the district averages for both BIPOC (38.2%) and low-income (20.3%)
populations. Further examination of the onboard survey data was completed to determine statistical validity of
the ridership demographics at the route/line level. As such, routes/lines that have a sufficient sample size will
be utilized to supplement the proportional analysis using ACS or population-based data. Routes/lines that do not
have sufficient sample size will be indicated with a N/A or not applicable. The ridership data analysis is utilized
for two purposes: 1) to compare with population-based data; and 2) to provide another threshold for determining
adverse effects on BIPOC and low-income customers. To assess whether a route has a relatively greater,
moderate or lower share of BIPOC or low-income customers compared to the RTD service area average, onboard
survey results are categorized using the following thresholds shown in Table 2.

Additionally, RTD quantifies the impacts of proposed changes on Access to Jobs and Key Activity Centers,
including jobs, retail/convenience stores, human and social service providers, senior facilities, and educational
institutions. Jobs is derived from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination
Employment Statistics (LODES) 2022 dataset. Key Activity Centers uses two data sources: Environmental
Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Business Analyst 2022-2023 and Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) Regional Data 2024.

Route- and Line-Level Major Service Change Analysis
RTD first reviewed changes in aggregate equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of
routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every
level. Major service changes are characterized as either major service decreases (i.e., a service reduction of
25% or more) or major service increases (i.e., a service increase of 25% or more). This runboard proposes
two major service decreases and nine major service increases.
Having identified the service changes which meet the threshold of the major service change policy, the next
step in the analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential DI and/or DB on both service
decreases and service increases. For service increases, the analysis examines the extent to which BIPOC and
low-income populations benefit compared to non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations. For service
decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the changes burden BIPOC and low-income populations
compared to non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations.

DI and DB Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the service area’s equity and nonequity populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional
review is required for potential adverse impacts

Weighting and expanding survey data are crucial steps in market research to ensure your findings accurately represent
the target population and allow for more reliable generalizations. Weighting adjusts for discrepancies in the sample's
demographics compared to the population, while expansion helps you translate sample findings into estimates for the entire
population.

2.15.G.b

In concert with RTD’s Title VI Program policies, RTD reviewed the demographics of each of the major service
changes’ routes/lines for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the
extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of BIPOC and low-income populations. Because
these are proposed service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for
potential concerns. The narrative analysis of each individual route/line follows, which includes further
considerations of access to jobs, education, health care, retail and convenience stores (including grocers), and
social services for BIPOC and low-income populations.

Route 29
Proposal: With the implementation of changes to the Route 30, the Route 29 would be eliminated and replaced
by extended trips on the Route 30 – South Federal.
As shown in Table 3, a larger share of the service area’s low-income population (0.78%) would be affected by
the proposed major service decrease compared to the non-low-income population (0.42%). This meets the 10%
DB threshold (0.42%). Similarly, a higher percentage of BIPOC populations (0.68%) would be impacted
compared to non-BIPOC populations (0.37%), meeting the 10% DI threshold (0.41%). These results indicate
both a potential DB and a DI finding.
Further, the route-level ridership data show that 69% of boardings are by BIPOC customers (Table 4), indicating
a greater share of BIPOC customers on the route. The onboard survey route-level analysis also shows that 82%
of boardings are by low-income customers; however, the sample size for this group is too small to be considered
statistically valid. As a result, no further analysis will be conducted for income using the ridership data.

As Table 5 illustrates, the elimination of Route 29 would affect access to 7,431 jobs. Of these, 42.1% are lowto-medium wage jobs — above the RTD service area average of 35% (Figure 1). Additionally, 12.8% of the jobs
are held by BIPOC workers (below the service area average of 14%), while 21.3% are held by Hispanic/Latine
workers — higher than the service area average of 18%.

Taken together, these findings suggest potential equity impacts at the route level that would require further
review, including analysis of access to key activity centers, community input, and system-wide effects. However,
Route 29 is proposed to be entirely replaced by Route 30 without any loss in coverage or frequency (see below).
Thus, potential equity findings and impacts on the populations, jobs, and key activity centers described here are
mitigated.

Route 30
Proposal: Extend southbound trips of Route 30 from Federal/Evans to Littleton/Downtown Station, as well as
matching headways as described in the System Optimization Plan: weekday service from 4:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.,
while Saturday and Sunday service would operate 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. This recommendation replaces Route
29 with no loss in coverage or frequency. The Route 30 is also proposed to no longer serve Bear Valley via
Dartmouth, and to instead continue straight along Federal Blvd between Colfax Ave and Littleton Downtown
Station. Bear Valley would instead be served by Route 35.
Because Route 30 is proposed for both an increase and a decrease, calculations for DI/DB findings are performed
separately for the segment receiving increases and for the segment receiving decreases.

Route 30 Service Increase

As shown in Table 6, a larger share of the service area’s low-income population (1.83%) would benefit from
the proposed major service increase compared to the non-low-income population (0.78%). This meets the 10%
DB threshold (0.70%). Similarly, a higher percentage of BIPOC populations (1.68%) would benefit compared to
non-BIPOC populations (0.57%), meeting the 10% DI threshold (0.51%). Given that this is a service increase,
these results indicate neither a potential DB nor a DI finding.
Further, the route-level ridership data show that 66% of boardings are by BIPOC customers (Table 7), indicating
a greater share of BIPOC customers on the route. The onboard survey route-level analysis also shows that 76%
of boardings are by low-income customers, indicating a greater share of low-income customers on the route.
Taken together, these findings do not suggest potential equity impacts at the route level that would require
further review.

Route 30 Service Decrease

In addition to its extension, Route 30 is proposed for elimination of its western segment that would instead
receive coverage from Route 35. The following calculations pertain to this segment.
As shown in Table 9, a slightly higher share of the service area’s low-income population (0.44%) would be
impacted by the proposed major service decrease compared to the non-low-income population (0.43%). This
does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.47%). A higher percentage of BIPOC populations
(0.54%) would be impacted compared to non-BIPOC populations (0.36%), meeting the 10% DI threshold
(0.40%). These results do not indicate a potential DB finding but do indicate a potential DI finding. Ridership
data for this service decrease remains the same as above, indicating a greater share of both BIPOC and lowincome customers on this route; please refer to Table 8.

No DB is found at the route level. Therefore, no further examination is needed to assess adverse effects on lowincome populations. However, there is a potential DI finding, which suggests potential equity impacts for BIPOC
populations requiring further review, including analysis of access to key activity centers, community input, and
system-wide effects.

Route 35
Proposal: Reroute trips of Route 35 between Federal/Evans and Wadsworth/Hampden Park-and-Ride, covering
areas no longer served by Route 30 due to its extension to Littleton/Downtown Station. The recommendation
also includes the truncation of Route 35 south of Wadsworth/Hampden to eliminate service duplication to
Long/Bowles. Service frequency would be increased to 30 minutes for most of the day. Additionally, it is
recommended to replace the seasonal tripper service on Route 30 with a concurrent tripper on Route 35,
covering the same area and time as the previously discontinued seasonal tripper service.
Route 35 Service Increase

As shown in Table 11, a higher percentage of the service area’s low-income population (1.20%) would benefit
from the proposed major service increase compared to the non-low-income population (0.67%). This does not
meet the 10% DB threshold (0.60%), meaning no potential DB is found. Similarly, a higher percentage of BIPOC
populations (1.92%) would benefit compared to non-BIPOC populations (1.37%), not meeting the 10% DI
threshold (1.24%). As a result, there is no potential DI or DB findings at the route level, and no further review
is required.
Further, the route-level ridership data shows that 64% of boardings are by BIPOC customers (Table 12),
indicating a moderate share of BIPOC customers on the route. The onboard survey route-level analysis also
shows that 60% of boardings are by low-income customers, indicating a moderate share of low-income
customers on the route.

requiring further review, including analysis of access to key activity centers, community input, and system-wide
effects.

Route 36
Proposal: Establish a consistent 60-minute service frequency during all hours of operation.
As shown in Table 16, a greater share of the service area’s low-income population (0.89%) is expected to
benefit from the proposed major service increase compared to the non-low-income population (0.52%). The
difference meets the 10% DB threshold (0.47%). Therefore, no potential DB is identified at the route level.
Similarly, a higher percentage of the service area’s BIPOC population (0.81%) is expected to benefit compared
to the non-BIPOC population (0.47%). The difference meets the 10% DI threshold (0.42%), indicating no
potential DI at the route level.
The route-level ridership data show that 63% of boardings are by BIPOC customers and 66% are by low-income
customers (Table 17). However, the sample size does not meet the threshold for statistical validity. As a result,
no further analysis by income will be conducted using this ridership data.
Based on these findings, there are no potential equity impacts at the route level that warrant further review,
such as additional analysis of access to key destinations, public input, or system-wide effects.

Proposal: Increase peak period service frequency (AM and PM peaks) to 30 minutes. Base period service would

As shown in Table 19, a lower percentage of the service area’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.54% vs. 0.79%,
respectively). This difference meets the 10% DB threshold (0.71%). Therefore, a potential route-level DB is
found. A slightly lower percentage of the service area’s BIPOC population benefits from the proposed major
service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.70% vs. 0.75%, respectively). This difference
does not meet the 10% DI threshold (0.68%). Thus, there is no potential DI found at the route level.
Further, the route-level ridership data shows that 64% of boardings are by BIPOC customers (Table 20),
indicating a greater concentration of BIPOC customers on the route. The onboard survey route-level analysis
also shows that 41% of boardings are by low-income customers; however, the sample size for this group is too
small to be considered statistically valid. As a result, no further analysis will be conducted for income using the
ridership data.

Proposal: Extend the hours of operation on weekdays and Saturdays to 7:00 p.m., while also making minor
changes to schedule. The change would address the needs of transit-dependent workers in Longmont, match
operation hours of routes 324 and 326, allow for improved connections, and improve on-time performance.
As shown in Table 22, a slightly higher percentage of the service area’s low-income population stands to benefit
from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.74% vs. 0.42%,
respectively). This difference meets the 10% DB threshold (0.38%). Therefore, no potential route-level DB is
found. A higher percentage of the service area’s BIPOC population benefits from the proposed major service
increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.60% vs. 0.41%, respectively). This difference meets the
10% DI threshold (0.37%). Thus, there is no potential DI found at the route level requiring further examination
(i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement and system-level analysis).
The onboard survey analysis for this route, shown in Table 23, shows that 54% of customers identify as BIPOC
and 81% identify as low-income. However, the sample size does not meet the threshold for statistical validity
for either group. Therefore, no further analysis by race or income will be conducted using this ridership data.

Proposal: Add three eastbound morning peak and two evening peak trips, as well as westbound two morning
peak and three evening peak trips, to address occurring overloads, between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. as well as
4:00p.m. and 5:30p.m. on weekdays.
As shown in Table 28, a higher percentage of the service area’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.20% vs. 0.67%,
respectively). This difference meets the 10% DB threshold (0.60%). Therefore, no potential route-level DB is
found. A lower percentage of the service area’s BIPOC population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.71% vs. 0.95%, respectively). This difference
does not meet the 10% DI threshold (0.86%). Thus, there is a potential DI found at the route level requiring
further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement, and system-level

Systemwide Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2025-2028 Title VI Program, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system-level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
BIPOC and low-income populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average service area thresholds for BIPOC and low-income populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of service area block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•

Of the nearly 201,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service increases, BIPOC
and low-income populations represented an above-average share of population compared to service area
averages. Of this total, over 89,000 BIPOC people and over 57,000 low-income people would receive
service improvements.

•

Of the nearly 24,000 people impacted by the major service decreases (Routes 30 and 35), BIPOC and
low-income populations represented an above average share of population while low-income populations
represented a slightly above average share of population compared to the service area averages. Of this
total, over 9,000 BIPOC people and over 5,000 low-income people would be negatively impacted by the

2.15.G.b

service decreases. Routes 29 and 38 were excluded from the systemwide analysis as the coverage of
service are recouped by the Routes 30 and 34, respectively.
•

At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes6 were compared only for those with major
service changes. A majority of bus routes with major service increases serve above-average BIPOC and
low-income populations. Six of the eight routes are considered low-income-serving routes, while five of
the eight routes are considered BIPOC-serving routes. Two bus routes with major service decreases serve
above above-average BIPOC and low-income populations. Both are considered BIPOC and low-incomeserving routes

In review of the proposed major service increases at the systemwide level, there is not a potential
DI or DB finding. In review of the proposed major service decreases at the systemwide level, there
is a potential DI or DB finding.
An analysis of all service area block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline
equity thresholds for BIPOC and low-income populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts
of the August 2025 service change. Block groups with BIPOC and low-income populations at or above the
service area average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas block groups with nonBIPOC and non-low-income populations are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Systemwide Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above service area averages for low-income population (20.3%)
and BIPOC population (38.1%)
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts
As illustrated in Table 34, there are 2,220 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the
District.7 Using the 2019-2023 5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was
calculated as well as the total BIPOC population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to
determine the District-wide low-income and BIPOC rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are
classified as above average. While the percent BIPOC Figure of 38.1% was derived by using the base population
of the service area (3.08 million), the low-income population percentage of 20.3% is derived from a slightly
smaller population figure (3.04 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census
Bureau can determine.8

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Table 35 summarizes the change in service for total block group populations underlying the bus
stops with proposed major service increases proportionally compared to population in the District. Table 36
summarizes the change in service for total block group populations underlying the bus stops with proposed
major service decreases proportionally compared to the population in the District. The comparison reviews the
equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall equity
composition of the District overall.

Based on existence of the route within the August 2025 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2019-2023 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
7
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
8
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

Summary of Findings
The proposed major service changes for August 2025 include a mix of service increases and decreases, with
route adjustments impacting frequency, span of service, and route miles. These changes affect multiple routes
across the RTD system. Overall, the proposed service changes show both benefits and potential impacts at the
system and route levels.

Route/Line-level Findings
Of the 58 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, six had potential findings:
•

•

•

•

•

•

Route 29:
o ACS Data: Potential DI and DB identified
o Ridership Data: 69% BIPOC customers (greater share) and 82% low-income customers
(greater share; low-income sample not statistically valid)
Route 30:
o ACS Data: Potential DI for the proposed decrease; no DB
o Ridership Data: 66% BIPOC customers (greater share) and 76% low-income customers
(greater share)
Route 35:
o ACS Data: Potential DB for the proposed decrease; no DI
o Ridership Data: 64% BIPOC customers (greater share) and 60% low-income customers
(moderate share)
Route 135:
o ACS Data: Potential DB; no DI.
o Ridership Data: 64% BIPOC customers (greater share); low-income sample (41%) not
statistically valid (lesser share)
Route FF2:
o ACS Data: Potential DI
o Ridership Data: 43% BIPOC customers (lesser share) and 37% low-income customers (lesser
share)
Route FF4:
o ACS Data: Potential DI.
o Ridership Data: 43% BIPOC customers (lesser share) and 37% low-income customers (lesser
share)

Systemwide-level Findings
•

•

•

Over 200,000 people live near bus stops of routes with major service increases. BIPOC populations
represent nearly six percentage points higher than the service area average (44.30%) and low-income
populations represent nine percentage points higher than the service area average (29.37%).
Nearly 24,000 people live near bus stops of routes with major service decreases. BIPOC populations
represent nearly five percentage points higher than the service area average (4.69%) and low-income
populations represent nearly two percentage points higher than the service area average (1.69%).
No system level DI or DB for the eight major service increases. BIPOC populations received 1.71% more
of a benefit compared to non-BIPOC areas. The difference was above the DI threshold by 2.30%;
therefore, no potential systemwide DI was found. Low-income populations received 3.63% more

•

benefit than non-low-income populations. The difference was 4.20% above the threshold for a potential
DB; therefore, no potential DB was found with the proposed service increase. As a result, a
greater share of the service area’s BIPOC and low-income populations stand to benefit from the service
increases as compared to non-BIPOC and non-low-income populations.
System level DI and DB finding for the two major service decreases (Routes 30 and 35). Specifically, a
slightly greater percentage of BIPOC populations are more likely to be negatively impacted from the
decreases than non-BIPOC populations (0.85% vs. 0.70%, respectively). Likewise, a slightly greater
percentage of low-income populations are more likely to be negatively impacted from the decreases than
non-low-income populations (0.82% vs. 0.74%, respectively).

Next Steps for DI and DB Findings
Given a potential DI or DB, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative that would serve the same objectives
and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential DI and DB, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less DI on BIPOC customers or DB on low-income customers but would
still accomplish the project or program goals.
RTD conducted a thorough equity analysis of the proposed August 2025 service changes, assessing both routelevel and systemwide impacts. While several individual changes result in potential DI’s or DB’s RTD concludes
that the service plan, as a whole, does not result in an inequitable distribution of benefits or burdens. Where
possible, RTD has taken steps to mitigate these impacts and has determined that the remaining impacts are
justified and operationally necessary.

Service Increases
Although two proposed major service increases, Routes FF2 and FF4, result in potential DI, and one (Route 135)
results in a potential DB, RTD recommends proceeding with the proposed improvements. These findings do not
raise concerns of inequitable benefit distribution due to:
•

The results of the systemwide analysis, which shows overall benefit to equity populations;

•

The absence of DI’s or DB’s on the remaining eight routes with proposed service increases; and

•

The strong legitimate justification for the improvements, aligned with the Board-approved System
Optimization Plan and the lack of viable alternatives that would avoid or reduce the identified impacts.

Route 29 – Service Decrease
The proposed elimination of Route 29 results in a potential DI and DB. However, this route is proposed to be
fully replaced by a revised Route 30, with no loss in frequency or coverage. As such, impacts to affected
populations, jobs, and Key Activity Centers are mitigated. Given that alternative service is maintained, equity
concerns are considered minimal, and RTD recommends proceeding as proposed.

Route 30 – Western Segment Elimination
The elimination of Route 30’s western segment results in a route-level DI. While a proposed reroute of Route
35 will replace most of the eastbound service from Wadsworth/Hampden Park-n-Ride to West Yale Avenue/South
Hooker Street, two of the five stops between West Dartmouth Avenue/South Raleigh Street and South Lowell
Boulevard/West Linvale Place exceed a quarter-mile from the nearest available service and will lose coverage.
Per RTD’s DI Policy, the agency evaluated modifications to avoid, minimize, or mitigate these impacts. At this
time, no practical alternatives have been identified. RTD will continue to monitor this area and revisit potential
solutions in future service planning.

Route 35 – Reroute
The proposed reroute of Route 35 results in a DB due to the loss of service coverage in specific areas. Although
Route 76 will help offset the change by providing alternative service from Southwest Plaza to South Wadsworth
Boulevard/West Mansfield Avenue and westbound from West Jefferson Avenue/South Wadsworth Boulevard to
Southwest Plaza, five of the 11 eastbound stops between West Jefferson Avenue and West Dartmouth Avenue
exceed a quarter-mile from available service. RTD evaluated alternatives but found no operationally feasible
routing options that would fully restore coverage. In alignment with the DB Policy, RTD will continue exploring
mitigation strategies during subsequent planning efforts.

Service Equity Analysis: August 2025
While isolated DI’s and DB’s have been identified, RTD finds that the service plan does not result in an overall
inequitable distribution of benefits or burdens. Impacts have either been mitigated through complementary
service changes or are supported by substantial legitimate justification aligned with agency goals. RTD
recommends proceeding with the August 2025 service changes as proposed and remains committed to
monitoring these areas and engaging communities to identify future adjustments where feasible.

July 16, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the August 2025 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Local Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001,
the August 2025 Service Change proposal facilitates opportunities for Service Development Division
staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit network and Operations Department personnel to
select new work assignments.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels, operators in training, and anticipated attrition, the August 2025
service change recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward the availability of
staff. The recommendations are centered on continued System Optimization Plan (SOP)/Comprehensive
Operations Analysis (COA) implementation, necessary rail reconstruction efforts, and seasonal
adjustments, and improving system performance and reliability by way of service enhancements,
reductions, and adjustments.
The August 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP/COA-related increases and
optimizations. Among the more notable changes are:
•
•
•
•
•

Service reconfiguration of Routes 29, 20, 31, 35, and 36 in the South Federal area
Service reconfiguration Route 38 – West 38th and implementation of Route 34 – Bruce Randoph
Avenue
Increases to service frequency on Route 135 – Smoky Hill Road
Increase of service on the FF2 – Boulder /Denver Express

Summary of Public Outreach
Between June 3 and June 26, 2025, a public comment period was opened allowing input from the
community regarding the August 2025 recommended service changes. Public meetings were held via
Zoom (virtual). Additionally, an updated feedback process was employed to collect customer input by
impacted route or line. Written communications, survey data, and public comments collected during this
public comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachments F and G of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 38 – West 38th and implementation of Route 34 – Bruce Randoph Avenue recommendation is
postponed, until the bus stop at the terminal can be made accessible by ADA standards.

RAIL SERVICE
As a result of the Kalamath Rail Replacement project (construction project), access to the
Central Corridor will be temporarily blocked, due to construction activities spanning from
Colfax at Auraria Station to the Theater District/Convention Center Station. The following
light rail service adjustments ensure reliable service to customers on the Southeast and
Southwest Light Rail corridors and mitigate service loss on the Central Corridor:

Attachment: August 2025 Attachment A [Revision 1] (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

As described in the SOP, three eastbound morning peak and two evening peak trips added,
as well as westbound two morning peak and three evening peak trips, to address occurring
overloads, between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. as well as 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on weekdays.
Anticipated cost: 1.5 FTE weekday

D Line – 18th/California Station to Mineral Station
Service diverted to Denver Union Station during the construction project.
Anticipated cost: None
E Line – DUS to RidgeGate Parkway Station

Packet Pg. 225

2.15.H.a

Attachment A

H Line – 18th/California Station to Florida Station
Due to limitations in Denver Union Station, H Line service terminated at Southmoor Station,
requiring a transfer to the E Line to continue to destinations farther along the Southeast and
Central Platte Valley corridors.
Anticipated cost savings: 11 FTE
L Line – 30th/Downing Station to 16th/Stout Station
Service suspended due to construction on the Kalamath segment and high-block replacement
efforts along the Welton segment given; access from the Elati Division to the Central Corridor
will not be accessible for L Line operations; alternative service can be found on the Route
43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.
Anticipated cost savings: 6 FTE
R Line – Lincoln Station to Peoria Station
Trip time adjustments to accommodate schedule changes anticipated on the E and H Lines.
Anticipated cost: None
W Line – DUS to Jefferson County Government – Golden Station
Trip time adjustments to better coordinate the operation of the addition of D line service into
DUS.
Anticipated cost: None
Note: Workforce estimates listed as “Anticipated cost savings” would be redeployed to
duties supporting light rail operations, such as pull-back operations at Denver Union,
RidgeGate Parkway, and Southmoor stations.

Attachment: August 2025 Attachment A [Revision 1] (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Trip time adjustments to better coordinate with the rerouting of the D Line into Denver Union
Station.

​Submitted as Public Comment to the RTD Service Change Process, June 14th, 2025.​
​June 14th, 2025​

​August 2025 Service Changes​
​Dear Mr. Carter,​
​Greater Denver Transit (GDT) has the following comments on the proposed August 2025 service changes:​
​H Line Termination at Southmoor​
​GDT notes the discussion between Directors and service planning staff that occurred during the Operations,​
​Safety & Security meeting on June 11th.​
​We would like to emphasize the importance of treating the H Line line as a connecting shuttle between​
​Southmoor and Florida. Southbound H Line trains need to depart Southmoor as soon as practicable after​
​southbound E Line trains have called. Likewise, northbound H Line trains should depart Florida as soon as​
​possible after southbound R Line trains pass.​
​For late afternoon and evening special events at Empower Field or the Ball Arena, consideration should be​
​given to running H Line trains to Union Station using the space in the schedule freed up by other lines reducing​
​frequency to 30 minutes after 6pm.​
​L Line Suspension​
​GDT is greatly concerned that once again, service on the L Line is withdrawn due to construction work​
​happening elsewhere. This is particularly frustrating at a time where the L Line needs support more than ever​
​as it is now clear that there are members of the community who have so lost trust in the rail service being​
​useful that they are now campaigning to get it shut down permanently.​

Attachment: Attachment F (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

​Jessie Carter, Manager, Service Planning & Scheduling​
​Regional Transportation District​
​1660 Blake Street​
​Denver, CO 80202​

​We urge the agency to work with its Downtown Rail Loop construction contractors and industry experts to find​
​ways to keep the L Line running during the works as a Welton St shuttle. Possible measures could include:​
​1.​ ​Planning the reconstruction works in two parts so that there is always half the loop and one track​
​available for empty train movements to / from the maintenance facilities.​
​2.​ ​Minimizing empty train movements by storing light rail vehicles at 30th & Downing that don’t need​
​maintenance attention. On-board cleaning could be done by a mobile unit.​
​3.​ ​If not already present, installing disconnect switches that allow the OCS on Welton St to remain live,​
​even when the Downtown Rail Loop power is off.​

2.15.H.f

​greaterdenvertransit@gmail.com​

​Route FF4 Reinstatement​
​GDT welcomes the return of Flatiron Flyer service to Boulder Junction. However, we suggest this route serves​
​stops in Denver on 17th & 18th streets plus Union Station in order to provide connectivity from all parts of​
​Downtown to Boulder Junction.​
​Route LX2 Reinstatement​

​Route 6 ‘Realignment’ to Serve the Community College of Aurora​
​GDT fully supports providing service to Community College of Aurora’s CentreTech campus as a long overdue​
​addition to the network. The exact nature of the proposed diversion / extension is not clear from the description​
​provided on the service changes webpage. GDT requests a route map be provided to avoid potential confusion​
​over the scope of this proposed change. GDT notes that this change is in conflict with the SOP, which​
​proposes serving this campus by re-aligning route 169. We request a better understanding of the advantages​
​of adding additional route length and operator hours to route 6 in comparison to route 169.​
​Routes 29, 30 and 35 Reorganization of Service​
​The exact nature of the proposed diversion of route 35 between Evans & Federal and Hampden & Wadsworth​
​is not clear from the description provided on the service changes webpage. GDT requests a map is provided to​
​avoid potential confusion over the scope of this proposed change.​
​Route 32 Extension to Civic Center Station​
​GDT is in support of the extension of this route as it will increase access to Downtown for customers riding​
​from West 32nd Ave and improve Downtown connectivity. It is also fully in line with our Downtown Bus Plan.​

Attachment: Attachment F (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

​GDT is in support of the reinstatement of this route which will improve the connectivity between Longmont and​
​Denver.​

​Route 34 Reinstatement​
​GDT recommends this route be diverted to terminate at 41st & Fox with a connection at 38th & Blake after​
​traveling west along Bruce Randolph Ave to provide easy connections to Union Station via the A Line and the​
​west side via the G Line. Adequate service to the Downtown Loop area and Five Points from points east of​
​30th & Downing Station is already provided by Route 43 which runs 2-3 blocks south of Bruce Randolph Ave.​
​The provision of a map will clarify for all customers the exact alignment of route 34.​

​greaterdenvertransit@gmail.com​

​Route 38 Termination at 30th & Downing​

​The graph above shows the numbers of passengers on board a westbound route 38 bus, averaged out over​
​the September 2024 runboard period. Apart from the extreme ends of the route, it can be seen that the lowest​
​numbers of riders are on board at 15th & Stout, which points to passengers from Central Park heading into​
​Downtown getting off the bus at earlier stops (e.g. California & 17th) before the bus starts picking up​
​passengers on Lawrence St who are heading west on 38th Avenue.​
​These data lead us to conclude that the lowest numbers of thru-riding passengers are on board in central​
​downtown on 15th St, so it makes sense to split the route there, not at 30th & Downing. Therefore, GDT​
​recommends that this route’s long term eastern terminus is Civic Center Station in accordance with our​
​Downtown Bus Plan.​
​GDT would also like to see this bus rerouted to serve Union Station via Wewatta St to improve connectivity. We​
​note that the stop that shows the most passengers boarding for westbound customers is Lawrence & 18th​
​which is the closest one to Union Station.​

Attachment: Attachment F (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

​GDT notes the poor punctuality on this route which mainly manifests itself in eastbound buses being delayed​
​on West 38th Ave and thus entering downtown behind schedule. This is exacerbated by the routing Downtown​
​which takes the buses close to Coors Field on streets that do not have bus lanes.​

​Lack of Advance Schedule Information​
​GDT remains disappointed by RTD’s continuing inability to provide even the most basic information on​
​proposed timings. While we understand that any proposed schedule may be subject to change, it shouldn’t be​
​beyond the capabilities of staff to provide summaries of how they have scheduled routes. Even simple​
​statements such as “Route A buses are planned to depart station Z at :xx past the hour, this is to allow​
​customers to connect from B Line trains, which arrive at :yy past the hour.” would be immensely helpful and​
​reassuring to customers who currently feel ignored on this very important part of service planning.​

August 2025 Recommended Service Change Public meeting
Monday June 16, 2025
12:00 p.m. via Zoom (virtual)

Hi, this is Julian Robinson of Broomfield. I just wanted to speak briefly in support of the FF4
reinstatement. It's been a route that I've used for many years before it was discontinued as a result of
the decline in ridership of COVID. It will be a phenomenal addition to the FFA Flatiron Flyer service,
especially to the business district in downtown. Being able to have commuters of Broomfield and
Boulder avoid having to change buses and Union Station in order to access the central business district
of downtown, and that would cut a tremendous amount of time off of daily commute. So, I want to
thank RTD for bringing that service back. I hope it'll make the line popular. I also believe it will help
reduce crowding on the FF1 as well. So again, thanks. And I also wanted to just quickly express my
appreciation to the RTD staff for their communications with me about this particular line. I've been
writing to RTD over the period of years. I'm asking when the timeline for reinstituting this line would be.
And
the
RTD
staff
has
been
very
responsive
and
I
appreciate
that.
That's all I have to say.

Jason Branstetter
Yes, hi, the guy before me kind of summed up what I was going to say FF4I used to take
that and I had a fall a few months ago and so walking is you know, I work by the
2:06p.m. So, it'll be great to take the FF4 and I'm glad that that bus will be coming back
because it was the one that I took with my uncle all the time and I'm just very glad that
we could have it back. So, thank you.
Elaine
This is Elaine with Boulder Chamber Transportation Connection. So, I am speaking in my
professional capacity today. We're really excited about the reinstatement of a lot of this
service. Like the increases for FF2 are really, really appreciated. The FF4I concur that
this is really good that it will be returning. I wish we were seeing the actual routing. I am
hoping that it does go over to 28th St. to service 28th and Canyon and also like just with
the AB buses as well. I hope that RTD is aware that 8 black shuttle service just shuttered
business as of Friday. No prior announcement or anything. So even when they were in
service, I heard from numerous people in the Longmont area that trying to get to the
airport was really challenging. So, any of these services that help link people from Gun
Barrel, Niwot, Longmont to service to the airport is very much appreciated. It's just very
challenging for some of us to get to the airport. So easier connections within Boulder and
access to their service, which made me recognize like there's no LD1 service on Sundays.
So having that would be awesome. What else would I get? Just really thank you for the
restoration of service. We're very excited to have Boulder Junction back and you know,
thanks for making it all happen.

OK Dylan, Dylan writes. I live in Littleton. I rely on the D line to get me to and from work every day
during Phase 1 of this project. I believe Dylan is referring to the downtown rail reconstruction project.
Service on the D Line was severely impacted. Despite the updated scheduling, I was left stranded after

2.15.H.f

work waiting for the train to arrive. Since the recent service changes back in January, the D Line reliability
has improved significantly. I'm worried that these proposed changes along with operator shortage
issues will lead to the same problems that occurred last summer recurring again. I'm just hoping RTD
has plans to mitigate this. And given the proposed suspension part of the H line, I'm worried it will
increase congestion on the E line.

Myra
I got here a bit late, so I just wanted to see if you could give me a brief just recap of
what the changes are going to be? Thanks.

Thanks, Myra. Our full presentation will be available online and we also have another
public meeting tonight if you'd like to see it from start to finish from 5:30 to 6:30 PM.
We also have an Ask a service Planner session from 5:30 to 6:30 tomorrow night. So,
for these public meetings today at noon and at 5:30, we are not going into answering
questions. We're not in question answering mode or we're actually having dialogue with
folks because we're simply trying to collect feedback. If you want to have a specific
question asked, we encourage you to attend our our Service Ask a Service Planner
session tomorrow from 5:30 to 6:30.
I will say that one adjustment, I'll reiterate that one adjustment that is happening, MITRE,
is that it's proposed to suspend the H line after the August service changes and do some
rerouting, some scheduled timing adjustments because of the resumption of work on the
downtown. Yeah, on the downtown rail reconstruction project, which will be affecting
routes that typically pass through the Auraria Colfax at Auraria Station, the Theater
District and Convention Center stations and the Welton corridor.
Merci has said has brought attention that there's not interpretation to this meeting.

August 2025 Recommended Service Change Public Meeting
Monday, June 16, 2025
5:30 p.m. via Zoom (virtual)
After a brief presentation, the following public comments were heard and transcribed from
the Zoom recording of the meeting:

Jack Rosenthal
Yeah, I'm Jack Rosenthal, I had comments regarding a couple of routes. I'm a writer in
Boulder County. I see there's schedule adjustments to the 76. One of the difficulty in
transfers I have is between 76 and LD 3 both ways. And the transfer time there is sometimes
like 30 seconds on the schedules. And I'm hoping that these schedule adjustments will
improve that and not make it worse.
On Route 228, the May 2025 service changes to implement the new detour through
downtown Superior is obviously implemented in a very unexpected way, in a way that's not
understandable to riders. I think the nice addition to Gate C is actually pretty cool, but we're
now adding two detours to three riders of the 228 there through Superior.
And I think this changed overall when we look at both what was just implemented and
what's going to be implemented makes it a lot longer to get through what was just a straight
through on Mccaslin. And we should be looking at both together to see if it makes sense
for three riders.
Boulder Junction, I really love it's being reopened. I just wanted to share. That's amazing
FF4 and AB2 are coming back there. 2O6 used to go back there or used to go there pre
pandemic and I would love to see it come back there in the future.
And then on the seasonal adjustments this summer season, I've noticed that route jump has
been full on a lot of the morning trips from the Lafayette Park and ride, which is hourly
during the summer. And we don't like passengers being turned away. So it I don't we should
reevaluate how that one is operated seasonally.
Thank you very much.

After a brief presentation, the following public comments were and transcribed from the
Zoom recording of the meeting:

Keith Brooks
Hello, I have a lot of little comments about a lot of these routes. We'll see how many I get
through today. First of all, extending the six to serve Community College of Aurora. Very
good to provide service to that location. That's always been a gap I've noticed. I am a little
curious about why it's being done by saddling the six with an extra extension, especially
since that will require making a new terminus for a bus, which I know can sometimes be a
problem, especially 'cause you got to find a bathroom for the operator and a lot of little
details like that. Whereas in the SOP and I'm working off the 2022 slides, the campus is

Packet Pg. 246

2.15.H.f

served by diverting the 169, which would be good anyway 'cause then you can make
connections at Aurora Metro Center. So I'm just kind of curious why of the ways you could
serve this route, it was done by extending the six.

Richard Bamber
I think it was in the presentation with the proposal for Route 32 to be extended through
downtown. So, this route comes in from W 32nd Ave. calls it Union Station and then rolls
through the downtown call of our 15th and 17th streets before ending up in a pretty natural
terminal Civic Centre. You know, arranging our routes that terminate downtown like this is
maximizes the connectivity, maximizes the transfer opportunities, maximizes the options
that that route will get you to exactly where you are going to downtown. You know, rather
than you may be having to connect onto the mall shuttle or only another bus. You know,
no surprise, we've been talking about our downtown bus plan a lot. It's all in line with that.
We're happy. I was kind of request that FF4 be given a similar treatment. You know, this
route starts at Civic Centre and all we're saying is put the call in at Union Station because
right now we're going to reopen Boulder Junction, but there will be no straight connect,
straight service from Union Station until Boulder Junction until of course, a train. So until
that train shows up, may I strongly, strongly advocate for inserting a call at Union Station.
It could go in via 18th loop around the bus concourse and then go out onto the express lane
ramps. And that would, again, for the same reasons as the 32, maximize our connectivity,
our transfer opportunities and generally increase the chances of people coming in from that
Boulder junction are being dropped off exactly where they need to be downtown. Thank
you.
Chris
Hey, how's it going anyway? I want to bring up some some stuff about the Route 30
rerouting. My, my concern is what about those that take the Route 30 to have to go to
Hampton and Wadsworth Park and Ride. And if you reroute that to go straight up and down
Federal, that could that could be an issue to some of those going to the that have to go to
Hampton and Wadsworth Park and Ride.

Attachment: Attachment F (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Another one I'll touch on is turning the H into a shuttle. I'm not saying that's necessarily a
bad thing, but it is one of multiple options. And I'm wondering how that conclusion was
reached as compared to putting those operators on the run board rather than another one
board on the extra board rather than using them to increase frequency on the R or any other
little creative things. So yeah, just questions that I don't expect an answer to now but was
on my mind.

And the other thing is with then my question is also with the Route 35, is that still going to
go to Hampton and Wadsworth Park and Ride or is that going to be bypassed completely?
Anakin Skywalker
Yes, I wanted to suggest is standing there 32 and 26 AKA 28 get a line to Old Town Arvada
station. And I had the paperwork here to show it, but I wanted to well, I can't bring it on
camera, but this is the paperwork for it for the 28. This one's still 32.

employees' public transportation costs and increase in service/flexibility will help us take advantage of this benefit,

I moved to the neighborhood with the idea that there would be lots of transit options (bike, train, bus, and
walking). Please make this happen!
Finally! Bus service at Boulder Junction. It's been far too long. I hope this route will also make it convenient to
transfer from the Bolt on 28th Street. to get on the FF4 to Denver. This bus should also have a stop like at
Wewatta or 17th and Market for access to downtown for people who don't need to go all the way to Civic Center
Highly support reinstating the FF4! It will make my commute to work much easier.
Thanks for adding service back to boulder junction

Fantastic! I work downtown on the opposite side of union station. Used to take ff4 all the time. Ff2 direct is nice
but too limited, too crowded, and far away from my ultimate destination. Ff1 takes much longer. I’m thrilled ff4 is
coming back.
I am very much in favor of RTD resuming this bus route. This service used to have stops (both inbound and
outbound) within 1 block of my office. Currently with my only option being the FF1 I need to walk around 8 blocks
to and from my office for Union Station. This is very inconvenient and time consuming. Resuming the FF4 service
will greatly improve my commute.

I drive every day from Boulder Junction to the Civic Center area in Denver. This line would allow me to take the
bus both ways, five days per week. It would completely eliminate my need for a personal vehicle. The proposed
times are great, I would also advocate for earlier departure times than what is currently planned.
I used to be able to get to work in an hour door to door with the ff4, but now I have to cross Boulder and pick up
the ff1 and now it takes almost 2 hours to get to work downtown. This would save me a lot of time
Please restore bus service at Boulder junction again.

Boulder station is a disgusting dangerous meth Den and we do not want that in theresidential Boulder
. Junction and Steelyards neighborhoods Rtd has been unable to control the violent . t drugaddicts that terrorize
community members and cause the station to close to have meth abated. What can you do to stop this here?
This change will enable my husband and me to use RTD to get to Denver.
Please increase service this will help many access essential services, especially youth, low-income households,
and people with disabilities
Reinstating service to Boulder Junction will make transit trips to my job (located in Boulder Junction) feasible
again!
The more routes around Boulder Junction the better!. Means more access.
Thanks for considering!

Thank you for considering this! Very much in favor :)
I used to ride this bus daily, I am so happy to see it return. Please bring additional bus service to Boulder

Now that this route is restored, I will start riding transit again from Broomfield to downtown Denver. I had stopped
riding and purchased a monthly parking pass because stopping at Union Station doubled my commute time,
making it quicker to drive. With this change, I can now get to my final destination, near Civic Center Station,
quicker than I can drive.
Please make this change as soon as possible!

Thank you so much! This will allow me to go back to my pre-covid commute and don’t have to get in a car at all to
commute into Denver. This would be amazing!
This would be life-changing and would significantly increase my transit use. Connecting from union station to the
civic center area is currently lengthy and difficult, this route would make a huge difference in my commute. I miss
the FF4!
THANK YOU!! This will have a huge positive impact on my life. I commute between downtown Denver and CU
East Campus daily - this will shave 40 minutes off of transit for me.
Please bring this line back!
Please proceed with bringing this route back. I currently do not have a way to get to work via bus without having
to walk a mile from Union Station and this route goes right past my office. Several coworkers will resume taking it
from Boulder as well. We have missed this route and are excited to have it back!
Currently today to get to downtown Boulder I must take another mode of transportation to the table Mesa station.
By adding a service to downtown Denver, this would reduce the burden and cost for me. Adding more services to
the Boulder Junction will revitalize this area and fulfill commitments that were promised in the past.
Please bring this line back! Very close to my work in Boulder and my partner's work in Denver. Thank you!
The trips into Union Station and then hoping on the 0 to get to civic center adds nearly 20 minutes. Being able to
skip downtown and get to civic center is so badly needed.

The possibility of the FF4 would be such a helpful change! Please please please bring this route back! I live in
Boulder and work on the east end of downtown Denver. I try to take public transit (the FF1 or FF2) but often end
up driving because my office is so far from Union Station. If the FF4 is available, I would take it every day and
never have to drive. I also have lots of coworkers and friends who work on the east side of downtown Denver but
live in Boulder and this would be a very positive impact for them as well.

The disappearance of the FF4 bus has been very impactful because I commute from Louisville to upper
downtown. Bringing it back goes a long way towards solving the problem of how to get from Union Station to the
other end of downtown, making bus commuting so much more convenient.
Please bring it back, and have it start at 6 AM or even 6:30 AM instead of 7 AM. Thank you.
This will significantly improve my commute to my office- I have been taking the FF1 which is always crowded and
sometimes doesn’t have space for my bike. Please reinstate this route
Would make my commute ~1000x better!

I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see the return of the FF4. I commute from McCaslin to 17th/Broadway, and
currently take the FF2 (if I can catch it) or the FF1, which means a 25 minute walk to work after the bus ride. This
is not feasible on some days due to time constraints, and is not comfortable on bad weather days. An FF4 option
would definitely increase my ridership into work.
This will make a huge difference in a positive way. Please add these back and increase frequency if possible

Please bring back the FF4! I would use it to commute for work near Civic Center, and it would replace several car
trips per week.
Thank you for reinstating the FF4! We need more options to get from Boulder to the Civic Center in Denver for
work.
I heavily relied on the FF4 route for my daily work commute from Flat Irons to Civic Center Station. I work at the
Judicial Center just south of civic center. Returning this route will save me much time and hassle from having to
catch other routes from Union Station to the Judicial Center. Please, please, please reinstate the FF4!!!
I live in Lafayette and work at 1300 Broadway. I used to take the FF4 to and from work every day before COVID.
Since then I have not taken the bus to work once. If RTD reinstates the FF4, I will take it to work three days per
week. Thank you!
This will be a transformative change to the system. No longer will I need to figure out last-mile travel logistics
because I work near Civic Center. Now the bus just goes from home to work, its magic.
As a state employee residing in Louisville and working near Civic Center, resuming this route is a wonderful
improvement to my commute, cutting the time nearly in half. The FF4 was part of the reason we purchased our
home in Louisville.
Thank you!
That would be fantastic to have this route back. Thank you for your efforts to make it happen!

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

I currently take 2 buses from Louisville to downtown Denver, because I work right next to Civic Center. Bringing
the FF4 back would reduce my commute 20+ minutes each way and means I would only need to take one busthat's at least 40 minutes a day! Some days I actually drive into work so that I know I'll get there on time for early
meetings, and bringing the FF4 back would reduce the days I drive. Please bring it back:)

I have been hoping that this route would be reinstated. I work very near to civic center and would love to take this
bus and skip the 15 minute plus detour I have to take at union station each day.
I would take this instead of the FF2. Please bring this back.
When I first moved to Denver, I was planning on taking the FF4 to get to work. However, this line was canceled
and never brought back, so I end up driving to work. It would be great to bring the FF4 back and allow me to take
the bus to work.
I have missed this bus so much. It allows me to get to Denver directly from my house. While it's been gone, I've
had to connect to a bus and use lightrail to get to my intended destination. My family and job are in the Denver
area, so much appreciated to be able to connect more easily to them. Thank you!

This would yield significant value to the community. I am strongly in favor of this.
Please bring back the Boulder/Civic Center bus that goes down California (departing from Table Mesa)!
My fiance works in Denver, very close to Civic center. She does not have a car, so when the FF4 was cut,
traveling to work took an extra 40 minutes, and included two transfers. While she can work at home, her work
wants her to come into the office more. Having a streamline route on public transportation would be a HUGE boon
to her ability to do that. Additional, there are more businesses near Civic center that people from Boulder would
like to use. Getting there and back via car is costly, as there is limited free/cheap parking

I anticipate use the FF4 quite extensively to commute between Boulder and Denver (to work, from home) - so
wholeheartedly support any and all changes that increase the efficiency of those trips and expand the options to
use the bus for my transit. This expansion is particularly desired -- my office is spitting distance from the Boulder
Junction station.
Game changing decision to get the FF4 back! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do this.
I know several others in the same boat that won't submit feedback to you.

It's very exciting to learn about the reopening of Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station! The return of the FF4
will be great for many, but I would also like to see a FF to Union Station from Boulder Junction. Thank you for
reopening our station!
This is long overdue. Hopefully frequency can also be boosted next time around.
This would make a huge difference to me - enabling me to travel between our office which is near Boulder
Junction to meetings in Civic Center without having to drive. Right now it's challenging to be a one car family, and
this would make it much easier!
Currently, in order to get to the Eastern side of Boulder, I have to take the FF1/FF2 to Boulder station and bike
across the city to get to my office because the 208 only runs once an hour. By including the FF4, this brings
service to a much closer location, so much so, that I wouldn't have to ride my bike every day.
A massive investment was made to create Boulder Junction. It would be nice to have at least one route use this
station. It would also be awesome to extend or add a GS-style route to this location.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

YES!!! BRING IT BACK! I work at Boulder Junction and this would be incredible.

Yes. We need to see Boulder junction working again. Traffic to get there is much less severe than going
downtown, and currently there are not enough times between Boulder and Denver. This will help.
Please do this! Working in Boulder Junction has been difficult since the loss of these busses. I know me and my
colleagues would appreciate this as it would open up more areas for us to live.
This route would streamline my commute to Denver by allowing me to only take one bus instead of transferring at
Union Station. It would also allow me to more easily ride my bike to the bus which is a big bonus!

Please restore this route as much as possible, beyond just 4 buses in each direction! Consider adding times as
early as 6:30 am and as late as 6:30 pm. Many of us working in downtown are not able to take public
transportation because union station is so far from our offices. This service to civic center was always packed prepandemic and expect it will be again.
With increased commuters into downtown, this service restoration is very much needed.

Long overdue
Very happy to hear this news I’ve been requesting the return of this bus service for several years now. This will improve my commute SO
MUCH so I really hope this bus service does indeed come back. Thank you!
This is a good addition for Broomfield. Thx. Shelly W.
I am extremely excited that RTD is bringing back the FF4 line. Not having to change buses at Union Station and
less stops to the Central Business District will save a tremendous amount of time on my daily commute. I will take
this route each day, as I did from 2003 to 2020 (including prior H route). Thank you so much RTD!! Julian

I commute from Union Station to Boulder-Broadway/Euclid Monday-Friday and take the FF1 because the FF2 has
not been offering routes that arrive by/before 8:00am in Boulder. Most of my fellow travelers are members of the
University of Colorado Boulder community and need to arrive by 8:00am to campus. The FF4 buses would
support the CU Boulder campus community greatly as the bus stops at Colorado/28th St. FF1 buses are standing
room only on the PM commute and run out of room for bicycles by US36/Wadsworth. Given this tremendously
high demand for FF1 and FF2 and now FF4 buses during peak commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am
and departing Boulder by 5:15pm), I am glad to see RTD is considering adding FF4 routes to support the high
demand for ridership. Adding FF4 routes during peak commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am and
departing Boulder by 5:15pm) would free up room on the FF1 buses for travelers who are picking up the bus after
Union Station west-bound and free up room on the FF1 buses east-bound for travelers not going directly to Union
Station. Many riders use the FF1 route for Denver sporting events, leading to standing room only buses and many
disgruntled fans who want a smoother and more direct experience. Having FF4 routes would also help mitigate
the high levels of congestion on US36 during rush hour.

I am very excited at the prospect of the FF4 returning. This will make getting to Northeast Boulder (from Denver) a

I love this bus. I love taking it and it was very convenient for me since I live near the junction station. It would
make most sense to have this one up and running again multiple times a day maybe not select trips. Also if you
could consider bringing back the ff6 six that would be great too.

I am so happy to see service open up again at Boulder Junction! Residents and employees are very eager for this
service return. I have been able to take advantage of easier connections to Denver buses off of the Bolt by
transferring at 28th & Canyon and hope that will still be feasible. I am hoping that the bus will also have a stop
closer to downtown Denver as there are downtown based employees coming to jobs near Boulder Junction as
well as Boulder Junction residents wanting to take advantage of amenities in downtown Denver
This is incredible news to hear!
This is great news! I might start riding the bus again - I haven't since the pandemic because of elimination of the
morning FF4 eastbound. I would then appreciate the extra westbound FF2 options after work.
The changes would be beneficial in the same ways that I stated previously, but in case it needs to restated:
I often want to visit Boulder with friends, but we live in different areas if Denver, so we have to carpool in multiple
cars or drive separately. Having an express line to Boulder would allow us to visit Boulder more easily and ecofriendly. Additionally, many of my friends as well as my partner work in Boulder, but live in Denver, since Boulder
housing is too expensive. This line would help cut down on car traffic if people could take the line straight to
Boulder for work.
Additionally, if there would be multiple stops on this line compared to FF2 express, the option would be nice to
use this bus line to get to/closer to places like Westminster, Broomfield, and Superior, which we visit frequently.
im so happy this was one I took all the time cant wait to ride this bus again.

4 trips each way makes commuting for a variety of reasons much easier, whether I'm visiting Boulder in the
morning or spending the day up there.

As someone who commutes from Denver to Boulder several days a week I am very excited to see this offered for
people like myself whos offices are closer to Boulder Junction station than the Downtown Station. This will give
me the option to not have to bike across town to catch the FF1 or FF2 every single day. Bad weather days
especially will be much better with a shorter distance to the route!

I travel daily from the Arapahoe station to the central downtown business district. After the elimination of the nonstop F-line, riders on this route have endured incredible inconvenience and unreliability. We are forced to switch
from the E-line to either the D or H line at Broadway, with no effort made to minimize connection times. Further,
the E-line faces very common cancellations and delays, and was plagued by slow tracking longer than any other
line. Once again rerouting all trains to Union Station will be yet another incredible inconvenience. Because it is
inexcusable that this is happening yet again, great effort is required to minimize this inconvenience. I strongly
suggest that RTD run non-stop frequent buses from Arapahoe directly to the central business district during the
period of rerouting.

It would be good to know how long the rerouting is going to last since it means a much longer trip to my office
potentially during the winter.
Good plan.
This will make taking the Light Rail even more inconvenient and unsafe as I go to the Denver Center for
Performing Arts.
One more reason not to go downtown.
It would be nice to have service from Evans station to union station on a permanent basis

Would make transfers to line 20 and w smoother
Transferring to the D line from union is very tedious, the D line stopping at union would be a great alternative. One
thing I would love to share for ideas is maybe have certain intervals of D line trains run to the typical 18th and
California and then have some certain time intervals run at union if that’s at all possible I think it would still be
great for people coming from the mall and also people traveling at union.
Understand the need for the downtown maintenance project. The Phase 1 project definitely made it challenging to
commute downtown from Englewood area. Two questions:
1. How long is the 2025 downtown maintenance project expected to last?
2. Afterwards, will we ever be able to get concurrent E and D service as it was pre-pandemic? It’s frustrating to
only have one or the other.
Have missed the C line - MIGHT take this for Rockies games - but security at Union Station is questionable
There was already an option to get to Union station. There is now no service to a more central downtown location.

It is almost impossible for me to ride light rail. I feel it is not safe to ride the bus or walk from Union station to the

too many ongoing service projects, delays and uncertainty.
I wish the D line would go to Union Station permanently.
Union station is a much better transfer point for me!!
This is closer to where I do happy hour and is easier for airport/A-Line transit, however would be farther from
where I work (if I still worked downtown, which I don't). But I'm sure other people do.

Union Station is horrible and Diverting rhe D-Line to this station is Only gunna attract mire fentanyl
attics/homeless to ride the train from Littleton and to/from the Union Station what a joke RTD never completes
these rail problems on time and now us riders who pay thousands a year for monthly passes have to endure this
type of trash I have stopped taking the train from Littleton due to their lack of security on top of them allowing
these homeless people to smoke fentanyl on the trains and they do nothing about it
Would love D line to always go straight to Union!!!!
Why do we have to change trains to get to Union Station from Littleton? Why can't you have a train that goes
directly to Union Station like you did several years ago? I already drive 20 or more minutes to take the train and
then have to take 2 trains to get to work and walk 3 blocks.
This would be awesome
I love this change. Switching and waiting for trains at I-25/broadway, Alameda and 10th/Osage to get to union was
a major inconvenience and has been sketchy in the past when taking late trains. This would make myself and my
wife feel more comfortable taking the train downtown as well as to the airport instead of driving and dealing with
traffic/parking. This would also convince my older parents to use the train when they visit and to go to
NBA/NHL/MLB games. THANK YOU!
This would impact my travel time by 1/2 hour. I work at the courthouse. If you are going to do this to the D line,
you should bring back the C line.
RTD rerouted trains to Union station a few years ago and it was extremely detrimental to D line riders and turned
off several riders from RTD. During that time RTD did not increase mall shuttle frequency causing significant
delays and inconsistent commutes for riders. Furthermore, 16th street has not been completed, creating even
more chaos and uncertainty for riders. This should be delayed until 16th street is completed, mall shuttles running
on 16th, and have increased frequency of mall shuttles to accommodate the diversion of the D line.

I rely on being able to easily get to civic center station for work via the Colfax at Auraria Stop. I would be okay with
this if there were positive alternatives. However, there are no beneficial ways to get from Broadway and I25 or
10th and Osage to Civic Center Station. I would appreciate a shuttle service or increase in one of the existing bus
routes departing from Broadway to account for this rerouting for it to not negatively impact my travel.

This is utter crap. It's hard enough already to get from Littleton to downtown without diverting to union station. The
present system of riders getting off and getting another train to Union Station works just fine right now. Why fix
what's not broken?
Diverting trains to Union offers easier access to sports stadiums and the airport. However, the most ideal setup for
me would be having every other d line train going to Union Station and every other train going downtown.
I already primarily use the D-line to get from Downtown Littleton over to the E line and then to Union Station.

If this change were made permanent it would be very convenient to me. Easier access to the A line without having

I hugely support this direct route the D line would take to Union Station!
PLEASE add a route from Littleton/Mineral to Union Station! It's the only way I can get downtown for work!
I feel like the C line was the proposed route once upon a time.

Quit screwing up the D line. You cater to druggies and gang members and don’t want regular office workers taking
the line. Very disappointing
I parked at the mineral light rail station. I work downtown 3 to 4 days a week. This will completely 100% disrupt
my commute. The D line has been disrupted for the last two years. It has been absolutely horrendous. I have so
sick of it. There is no need for this to take place. You can do this in phases. Just like you have before. You can
shut down the lines between convention center station and 18th and California. And disrupt it for maybe a week
but you do not have to completely move all train to Union Station. Meanwhile, my building is at 16th in California. I
would hope you would rethink this proposal. Thank you.
Does this mean the D Line would no longer go through downtown leaving only the H Line to get into downtown.
This is just ridiculous. You are already unreliable. This just adds to that. This is one of the stupidest ideas you
have ever had.
I currently take the D Line to my office near 18th & Stout.
I will 100% stop riding the train, and drive to work instead, as long as the D Line is diverted to Union Station.
My biggest reason for utilizing lite rail is to attend sporting events, Colorado Field, Ball Arena and Empower
Stadium. A person can access the 16th Street mall at Union Depot.
There has been no information shared about what the schedule/route changes will be or how long they will last.
The changes during Phase 1 were at least completed during the summer months when the weather was nicer to
allow for alternate options, such as biking a portion of my route to work. The new new changes for Phase 2 are
scheduled to become effective August 31 so that will be at a time when weather will be starting to get colder again
and there has been no communication regarding how long it will last. If it goes well into the Fall/Winter, then that
will have a significant impact on being able to use alternate modes of transportation.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Why wasn’t downtown reconstructed differently? You could have had trains still service downtown and turn at
convention center like during the parade of lights, instead there’s no easy access from CBD Denver to a train
without having to bus up to Union which takes time. You should have made more effort to reconstruct from colfax
to theatre district last year so you could still service Auraria and theatre district

I use 18th and California daily. Joust bring the E line back to Oxford and Hampton instead
1. I don't feel Union station is afe for a female Senior citizen
2. It adds too much time to my commute to go to Union station and then take a bus back to 14th and Stout
(convention cnter)
3. Bottom line: I will be driving, as RTD as the D line (ever since May, 2024) is no longer a viable public
transportation route. With all you delays and slow downs and maintenance, it has deteriorated into obsoleteness.

It’s better than nothing and I know the downtown rail construction will resume in September. I appreciated having
the option to transfer to/from the 0L line at Broadway during last year’s construction and hope that will continue
this year
I support this change! Bring the D line to Union!
Having the D Line go all the way to Union Station would be great!

You already eliminated the C line, reduced the D line schedule times which only offer me 2 choices to get to work
timely. Coming home is the same. Diverting the D line to Union station will add another 15 ,- 30 minutes to my
commute which means I can drive in a shorter amount of time.
Should be permanent or at least alternating option or similar
I find this inconvenient as I usually use the D line whenever I need to get into the heart of downtown and then can
simply walk from there. Now I will be required to ride it to Union Station and then transfer onto a bus as well.
This is an excellent change and will cut commuting time significantly - also consider adding express trains if
possible!
This is a great change, will make getting to the airport that much easier
While rerouting the D line to DUS would be more effective insofar as one's commute is concerned, the C line
should be revived and the D line maintain its current route.
I primarily use the D line to transfer to the A line for getting to the airport, so having a direct light rail connection
from Littleton to Union Station is very beneficial to me. That said, I hope that the C line can eventually return to
fulfill this purpose rather than redirecting the D line.
You have like five trains that go to union station and only two that go to 18th and cal. First there no need another
train clogged up the track at union and second student use that train go to colfax at Auraria it not fair for those
student to have to add extra time to either transfer trains or add walking time when your schedule are fuck
enough as is. It an added stress to my days and an additional negative impact from RTD to my education a on
going issues from the consistent lack of communication and understanding of your passengers time. This is a
useless change that benefits no one. Find the time to make consistency your priority. Not changing everything
every three fuck months.

I will not be able to take public transit to work if the train is rerouted to Union Station. Again. I recently moved to
Denver from Washington, DC. The metro system puts RTD to shame. It’s bad enough that the Rtd train is
frequently cancelled because no drivers are available, that homeless people treat the trains as mobile shelters,
and that RTD has cut the capacity of trains to two cars sandwiching us in like sardines, but having to walk an
additional 20 minutes each way to Union station when you JUST did this last year is TOO much. I want to support
public transit. But you make it impossible to use. Now I’ll be another of the thousands of cars jamming the roads
to force my way downtown every day. And why? Because you can’t offer reliable service. Please leave the D line
alone.

If the D Line is rerouted to Union Station I will stop using RTD altogether. I work at the Broadway end of the mall
and the D Line to California provides a happy medium for people working at both ends of the mall. It would add
another 30 minutes to my commute if I rode the D Line to Union Station.
I like this change!
If d is not going downtown best to extend to us
Right now I need to transfer to the E line at Broadway and this change will save time for me. I work near Union
Station
PLEASE keep the D line permanently routed to the Union station, I live in Downtown Littleton and would be
greatly impacted by more direct service to Union Station and I know many people who would be impacted
positively as well.
Please just bring back the C line!
This is the 2nd time in my memory that the D line is being diverted to Union station. Why not bring back the C
line? The C line was a great alternative to getting downtown from Littleton, and the D line would not have to
change to accommodate construction. I think the C and D running full time is a net positive for Littleton
There are many people who catch the earliest D-line currently from Mineral (5:10 a.m.) that making this change
will not allow us to get to work on time, last year we had to drive and not ride the train in order to make it work,
which seems unfair to the early commuters. One suggestion is to have the trains instead go to the Civic Center,
then turn around and go back to Mineral, this is done all the time by RTD for special parades downtown, etc. If
this doesn't work and you feel the trains have to go to Union Station then we'd ask that you add an earlier option
in the morning like 4:45 a.m. so that we can have time to ride to Union and get down 16th street to the other end
of town, or what many of us do is hop off at West Auraria and walk 20-25 minutes to where we work on the farther
end of downtown.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

I thought the diversion of D to Union Station ALL LAST SUMMER took care of this?!?!? This will add 20 minutes
to my already hour-long commute, and will likely mean that I will not be taking the light rail while this remains
diverted. How long will this diversion last? Come on, RTD--do you really want to lose all your riders???

For the love of God just call it bring the C line back, because that's really what it is. And if you say you can't
support what is essentially the c, e, and h lines out of union, what the hell were you doing a decade and some
ago when they all were running? I grew up with the c, d, e, f, g lines actually doing something useful, I even took
the g from Dayton to the Denver tech center on a near daily basis when I was working in the area. And then you
mess everything up. Stop messing everything up!

When you re-route the D-Line to Union Station, all it really does is remind people like myself and others how
much it would be an even better thing if the C-Line was brought back permanently. You know it's possible to
accommodate up to three light rail lines at Union Station, plus it would be far better for people in Englewood,
Sheridan, and Littleton to not have to transfer to an E-Line at I-25 and Broadway like they have had to do for
years now. Sure we will miss the trains going into the center of Downtown as the rail reconstruction gets back
underway, but keep in mind there is a trade off to this re-routing that ends up working in the favor of people who
otherwise don't have what they want right now.

Please route the D line to the convention center instead of Union Station. This allows everyone the ability to walk
to their work, or walk to 16th street mall for the shuttle. When you re-route to union station the shuttle takes a lot
of extra time just to reach the convention center area and constantly makes me late for work. If people are
dropped at the convention center, they could walk to the end of the 16th street shuttle before the shuttle would
even get there from union station. I timed it last summer during the previous re-route and it added 20 minutes to
my arrival time at work. I take the first train from Mineral in the morning. So I suggest you add a train at mineral 30
minutes before the 5:12 train to allow us early birds the opportunity to adjust our schedule and arrive on time to
work. I know you stop the trains at the convention center for parades downtown, so there is no logical reason you
couldn’t do that this time. Plus you avoid overwhelming Union Station. Please help out the people who work at the
end of the 16th street mall shuttle loop.
If I am going north past 10th and Osage I am heading to downtown. This will be great for getting to LODO
This proposal works as a temporary solution during construction.
I take the D line from Littleton & Mineral to the Convention Center regularly for work and for pleasure. Diverting
the D line to Union instead of turning it around at the Convention Center makes it so difficult for me, a disabled
individual, to get to the Convention Center. I know that there are some bus options that get me close to the
Convention Center, but I still have to struggle with uneven sidewalks to get to the bus stops. This also adds so
much time to my travel time. More than anything, it frankly becomes a safety issue as I am often downtown late at
night and I find the buses to have more unsafe persons on them at night.
When the D line went to union last august, it was much easier to commute for me personally, so this change
would be helpful for me in that regard

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Didn’t we just go through this last year? Why again? This time, get the work done. Rerouting to union station adds
20 minutes to my commute each way, not including the impact of any slow orders.

The D Line should be cut back to 20 minute frequency when rerouted to Union Station. This way, all trains should
fit at Union, but any more infrequent service will massively damage ridership.
The Union Station light rail platforms can handle 5 minute train arrivals/departures, they have in the past.
I would also like to see eventually a return of service for the C line for more convenient travel from the southwest
corridor. This would increased ridership on the southwest corridor and increase public transit travel in south
denver.
D Line should go to Union Station all the time, or provide a new line that goes from Littleton to Union

I don't want to use the H line to get to Union Station I want it to go downtown where it's supposed to go
There is no reason why the H line can't end at broadway. Having it serve only a handful of stations only 1 of which
(9 mile) is very busy is stupid and pointless. Having to do tranfers is a pain in the butt to transfer from an h line to
an e line usually means waiting another 15+ minutes for another train. Then having to transfer again to a bus just
to get to the downtown loop area is crazy and causing a 45 minute, 1 train trip to be more like 1.5+ hrs, 2 trains
and a bus trip
Cannot easily get downtown with this change
Can’t get to work at theater district

I believe it is a waste to run this train for 4 stops when just increasing the frequency of the R-line would
supplement the service lost on the H-line until Downtown reopens. Having half of the R-lines turn at Florida and
go back to Lincoln would keep the trains between Florida and Peoria running every 30 minutes. Passengers can
transfer at Belleview to go toward Union station. All the maneuvers through Southmoor get confusing for
passengers.
This makes the H line worthless
We'll allow for d line changes

Would it make sense to instead run H line from Alameda to Florida? That way H doesn't interfere with D line
rerouting but still serves a bit on I-25 alongside the E
Confusing
This change makes it virtually impossible for me to use RTD. It is an extreme hardship to be forced to go to union
station again. It is unsafe to walk from union station into the down town corridor. I will not ride the bus. As a result,
I will stop riding RTD for good this time unless RTD can restore my trust that it is reliable and safe. And, the trains
are not continuously routed to union station. It will take too long to go to union station. It is unclear how long the
work will last. It was difficult riding the train when RTD discontinued the F line. Please inform riders when the
diversion to union station will end.
This is ridiculous. It's been three years of non-stop headaches for myself and my wife to get to and from work
downtown. Now, you want to twist the knife in our backs even more? C'mon...can we just have reliable
transportation??? We switched to the bus for the last two years, and even they're unreliable. A lot of the time, we
would get to Nine Mile about 15-20 minutes late.
See earlier comments
While the proposed changes do not currently affect me, as I recently moved from Denver to Boulder, this will have
a terrible impact on many commuters. When I relied on the E and H lines a year ago, it often took me over an
hour to commute five miles.
The current proposal substantially affects H-Line commuters' ability to transfer and arrive to destinations in a
timely fashion. I propose that it would be better for the H-Line to continue onwards to I-25 and Broadway (or
further towards 10th/Osage). This will allow easier access to stops along the Southeast Cooridor without requiring
riders to transfer to the E-Line, and will give riders the options of either transferring to the E- or D- lines to
continue onward towards Union Station giving an average maximum wait time of 7.5 minutes to connect instead
of 15 minutes with only E-Line transfers available.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Why is this necessary? You did repairs last summer. Are you going to shut down rtd every summer from now on?

Why are we running this at all? Wouldn't it be better to drop the H line. Increase R service and transfer to E at
bellview? Southmoor will be a mess if that is end of line for H.

I commute into downtown Denver 5 days per week on H line. Even after slow zones are now all fixed, the exact
same one way ride is ten minutes longer than it was pre-covid. Which doesn't sound like a lot until you consider
that my total door to door one way commute time is now exactly 55 minutes. Even assuming the Free Metroride
bus consistently comes every ten minutes, my total one way door to door commute if I'm forced to detour to Union
Station will be at least 75 minutes. Which is a ridiculous amount of time for a commute from DTC area to 18th &
Stout. I know the union station detour is inevitable. I just beg you to adequately staff the Free Metro ride busses to
keep them coming consistently and often.

I usually take the D line to get to work. I thought I could transfer to the H line but, it looks like you will have nothing
going to the other side of downtown. This is HUGE! If we work near the Civic Center we will have to get off the
train at Union Station and then transfer to a bus to get to the other side of downtown. At least an extra 1/2 hour. I
thought you were working to make things easier on your customers. Not acceptable!
No track capacity? Thats a lazy excuse.
Why even have a train at all if it never works. Fix this shit
This just makes it more difficult to get from central downtown to Aurora. You should have reconstructed from
colfax-theater district last year so that the trains could service at least to theatre district this fall.
My spouse and I use the H line to get downtown. We purchased our home due to its proximity to a direct line to
downtown.
You propose ending H line service for everything past Southmoor. This not only has a huge negative impact on
the utility of the H line, it also means that our trips downtown will take even longer. Connections are already spotty
at best due to RTD constantly cancelling trains and trains running late. This will make rail travel to downtown
impractical for anyone who uses the H line today., probably taking it out to a 2-3 hour trip with the time spent
waiting for a connecting train.
We only just got the extension to the 35 that we so desperately needed and now you want to take away our only
direct route to downtown.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

I disagree with this move. If you must, stop the H at 10th/osage, lots of people ride the southeast corridor!
Stopping the H so south at southmoor makes no sense, there isn't even the D line like north of i25-broadway. AT
LEAST run the E line's 15min frequency later than ~6pm to support us who commute in the evening. Thank you
from a dedicated transit rider and advocate.

The proposed change would severely negatively impact my weekly schedule and remove about 90% of the
regular use I make of RTD. The need to catch a second train to get downtown, when considering the inconsistent
and undependable nature of the trains as it is, will mean getting downtown by train will be next to non-viable. This
change will mean I go from being a regular RTD user of at least two in some times five trips a week, to maybe
using it twice a month. I will be forced to find other ways to get places with the most likely being my personal car.
This is outrageous. For years, RTD has asked users to remain patience and be flexible. And just as the H line
comes back on line, RTD yanks it away. My patience has run out. I will no longer be supporting RTD and will
revert to taking my car to/from work.

With downtown corridor no longer being serviced by either H or D lines, it is CRITICAL that the Free MetroRide
running along 18th and 19th streets provide frequently reliable service, if RTD wants to retain ridership. Most of us
are exhausted by all the changes and slowdowns that have been happening on the H line for the last several
years. We finally just got the H line back to a reliable schedule and you are taking it away from us at the end of
this summer! I beg you to adequately staff the Free MetroRide along 18th and 19th streets so that it is a reliable
and timely means of getting to/from Union Station from downtown. If it is not reliable and timely, you will lose
ridership yet again.

Should be reasonable if timed appropriately
Perhaps Extend the H Line to Aurora Metro Cntr Station either permanently or just for this sevice change. Or just
temporarily eliminate this Line and extend the R Line to RidgeGate Parkway OR do nothing and temporarily
eliminate this route in order to save costs snd hopefully send money towards the L Line extension or B Line
If I understand correctly, there will no longer be a direct line to 18&California. This would totally kill all desire for
me to ride light rail ever again. In addition to safety concerns, scheduling is so erratic and unreliable that I rarely
consider light rail. It used to be my only way to go downtown. Not a service to east riders. Poor planning
If the H line will require a transfer, the lines running to DUS should be way more frequent to minimize disruption.
I suggest running the H line to Broadway Station instead of Southmoor Station. This allows people to transfer to
the 0 or 0L bus to get to Civic Center Station. If on before Southmoor, this avoids a transfer to the E. If boarding at
Southmoor or north, this puts another train on the line to reduce the time between each train arriving (H or E).
Without this change, I would likely drive my car to Broadway station to catch the 0L, putting another car on I-25.
Thank you.
Need a train to stop at theater district and you are taking that away
H-Line can be operated till I-25 & Broadway rather than Southmoor. To accommodate customer service until
Denver city limits.
This would be really helpful for College commuters and others due to the accessibility of Bus service available at
I-25 & Broadway

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Taking the E line in lieu of the H Line will require extra time and effort to get to the 16th and California area, which
goes out the window if the E line isn't scheduled enough, or the schedule isn't reliable. Otherwise, I'll avoid
downtown or drive when I need to go. Is there a way to make assurance the E line will be frequent enough and
dependable?

H Line service should not be cut back to Southmoor, creating a stub end service and forcing most riders to
transfer - ultimately killing ridership. The line should switch from the Downtown Loop to serving Union Station,
which would still offer a one-seat ride for many riders and maintain a viable Aurora-Downtown Denver commute.

The details don't make it clear whether this is a permanent or temporary change. Is it only happening during
construction? Or is this permanent? If temporary, fine, it's already been a miserable more-than-a-year relying on
busses and having to leave 30 to 60 minutes earlier for work, losing that find in my personal life, and apologizing
to my bosses for late busses and missed transfers, what's another summer. But if this is permanent I strongly
object. People from South Aurora should be able to get to downtown without having to travel a mile from Union
Station.
Would make it useless to me

How would students on H line get to the university of Colorado Denver if there is no train????? Transferring to e
line is unnecessary and complicated
This will negatively impact anyone who lives in Aurora and needs to commute to the Auraria Campus for school or
work. The Auraria Campus educates up to 30,000 students and employs thousands more. Aurora already draws
the shortest straw when it comes to public transit (rail and bus) and this would only add to this. This is a blatant
and flagrant show of system racism from RTD to the community of Aurora. Aurora and Southeast Denver have
already been through the wringer with the extended slow zones which has caused stress for many students and
employees. Aurorans are primarily folks of from marginalized groups who do not have the luxury of a vehicle or
remote work. Many people in Aurora rely on reliable rail service to downtown Denver, specifically to the Auraria
Campus. This work should be done during the summer months when traffic to the Auraria Campus is lessened
and the impact would be less dire. The solution of having folks transfer to an E Line will be detrimental to existing
E Line users especially since when this has happened in previous iterations, there were still only two rail cars per
route AND several cancellations. Please reconsider this proposed change to a later date.
I park at Yale. It makes me reliant on one line (E) that doesn't have a very good "track" record. Also the E line is
typically only running two cars. If you are going to make people transfer at Southmoor please add a car or two to
instead of running two cars. If a train cancels for no operator available then I have to wait 30 minutes at
Broadway.
I understand that the downtown rail needs to be updated, but the last year has been very frustrating using the H
Line from Nine Mile. The H line finally was fully back to normal at the end of May after a year of changing
schedules and delays. Due to the long commute that could be as long as 2 hours one-way back from downtown, I
had to turn to driving. I’d prefer to take the train, but it is not tenable when a commute doubles and is further
frustrated by months of delays and day-to-day changes. The train is such a great public service, and it’s
disappointing that so soon after it has been restored to normal service, normal service will be disrupted yet again,
very likely to result in a longer and less predictable commute.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Not having a train that accesses the Convention Center will greatly impact my commute. Sounds like I won't be
using RTD this August.

I take the H line to Louisiana pearl station frequently. Don’t understand why the H line would no longer go through
there, just because there is construction downtown

Packet Pg. 276

2.15.H.g

Cutting the H Line at Southmoor without increasing the E Line is a reducing in frequency. If you are reducing
frequency, please prioritize reliability. Improved and more reliable real time tracking would also help immensely.
During Phase 1 Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project, the train was unridable due to the reduced frequency,
unreliability, and slow speeds. One never knew when a train would arrive, if it arrived at all. I would ask that the H
Line service be extended to I-25 & Broadway during the construction to facilitate transfers between the H Line
and the D Line.
Adds time to commute due to transfer as well as requires additional time standing outside in weather. Hope the
route is able to continue downtown soon after the change is made. Also it would have less of an impact on riders
in Cap Hill and Baker if the H could at least continue to Broadway or 10th and Osage stations
I completely understand the need to reroute the trains during downtown construction. However, forcing a transfer
point at Southmoor does not seem to be the right location. Running the trains to Broadway/I25 where there are a
ton of buses that could help supplement access would make more sense. Or even running the trains down to the
Convention Center as has been done historically during downtown events. Providing access to downtown beyond
just union station is critical.
I understand that track capacity does not allow for the H Line to terminate at Union Station during Downtown Loop
reconstruction but why remove critical frequency and capacity along the rest of its route by having it terminate at
only Southmoor station? What is preventing the H Line from terminating at somewhere like Colfax at Auraria? The
project is already going to be disruptive to riders but unnecessarily reducing frequency along the light rail
network's highest frequency corridors that aren't effected by construction seems like a self-inflicted wound that will
deter customers from riding just as they are getting used to 5-minute interlined headways between 10th & Osage
and Broadway and 7.5-minute headways between Broadway and Southmoor.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

I take RTD almost every day and rely on routes in all parts of metro Denver to go where I want to go as I plan
things out. In the case of the H-Line, this is my fastest option from where I live to go into Aurora as I would take
bus route 12 to Louisiana Pearl and then transfer to a southbound H-Line which I would then take to Nine Mile or
Iliff depending on where I'm going first. Under this change I would have to take an E-Line and transfer at
Southmoor which I don't want to do, especially now that the rail lines are completely fixed and the slow zones are
done with, it's basically trading one delay for another. And while I understand that you can't have the H-Line go to
Union Station because of the added delays that were caused by that last year in addition to the implemented slow
zones, could it at least be possible to have the H-Line go as far north as I-25 and Broadway station so people
living along the corridor from Broadway to Colorado Blvd can be able to take a train to Aurora without having to
transfer? It would especially be a good thing for those going to DU who rely on the train to get to campus.

This portion of the H Line provides a transfer-free light rail ride from southern and central Aurora to downtown
Denver. Without it, we will have to transfer from the R to the E, which is yet another burden on transit users in
Aurora who want to get downtown, on top of the fact that the only existing rail links downtown at present take an
inconvenient jolt to the south before heading west

Packet Pg. 277

2.15.H.g

Absolutely not. The H line has been subject to the ABSOLUTE WORST of the slow zones over the past 1-2 years
and those taking this line have been subject to the worst delays out of any of the lines. Choosing to impact the H
line over the D line is incredibly upsetting.

In addition, this would drastically affect students commuting to University of Denver and the three colleges in the
downtown loop. Since the H line serves University of Denver, an additional important educational institution that
the D Line does NOT serve, you are directly causing the mental health and educational potential of dozens of
students commuting from Aurora to DU and the downtown loop who depend on reliable transit services. I
constantly witness students freaking out because they left several hours before their first classes started and they
were STILL LATE through absolutely no fault of their own. It’s so beyond upsetting that you are choosing to
impact the H Line over the D Line with all of the horrible delays you have subjected H Line riders to over the past
several years. There is absolutely NO confidence in RTD that the E line will be on time to facilitate transfers from
Southmoor to Union Station.
SHAME ON RTD. If you’re going to pull this horseshit again, you need to make the train free and fire all of your
racist transit cops.
The H Line should be cut back to 20 minute frequency when rerouted to Union Station. This way, all trains should
fit at Union, but any more infrequent service will massively damage ridership. Terminating the H at Southmoor will
render the service useless for the vast majority of riders.
The Union Station light rail platforms can handle 5 minute train arrivals/departures, they have in the past.
Can this temporary service be extended to Broadway Station? The interlined service with the E Line between
Broadway and Southmoor is very useful and significantly increases bus connections.
H Line should go all the way to Peoria

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Specifically, from Florida (H Line terminal station) to I-25 & Broadway, it takes approximately 31 minutes with no
delays. From Mineral (D Line terminal station) to I-25 & Broadway, the trip is only 16 minutes. Essentially RTD is
proposing that a much longer trip (the H line) be subject to, again, the worst delays of any currently operating line.

This would make my life so much better yess
As a current FF2 rider I highly support increased frequency of service to alleviate crowding and provide additional

Thanks for adding service back to boulder junction

entire ride. This is a great route and it needs more frequency please!!!!!

Morning routes are currently packed, often standing room only (scary on a highway!). Additional runs will give
more flexibility on time to catch and thin out the bus. I wish a west-bound run after 5:30 would be added. Catching
a 5:30 bus after can be tough
Essential!!!!!
Thank you!!
Please increase service this will help many access essential services, especially youth, low-income households,
and people with disabilities

This increase in services is much needed and would be beneficial if it could be rolled out even sooner. The
morning eastbound trips on FF2 are extremely full (standing room only all the way up the aisle up to the white line
by the driver). We are having to pack in more and more tight every week it seems, and the ride experience and
safety are suffering.
I routinely take the FF2 eastbound every day to work. The earlier one that stops at McCaslin Station at 7:36am is
routinely full, and every Tuesday it is standing room only for those that board at that station. Today (6/17) there
was almost not enough standing room on the bus and two people had to stand on the entry way steps. Please
increase the frequency of the FF2 (especially during the summer months with students commuting to Denver).
Thank you!
This is huge! I ride this 2x a week and almost all the seats are filled up after table Mesa park and ride. I ride the
7:51 eastbound in the morning.
it'd be useful to provide the proposed service times so the users can actually make feedback to you.
Yes! I run to the station and take this daily
This would aid commutes.
More trips gives me more flexibility. I prefer the FF2 over the FF1.
The additional service will be so helpful to riders, especially during the middle of the week when traffic is at it's
worst. I'd like to take this line more but the last FF2 is just a little to early in the day for me. Additional times is
greatly appreciated.

Please make this change as soon as possible!

I have not been using the bus from Louisville because of the limited express options. Adding these trips will make
me much more likely to get back on public transportation
I fully support the proposed changes. Thank you.
Increased FF2 trips would be immensely beneficial to my commute, and would increase my ridership. I get on at
McCaslin in the morning, and the bus is often full by the time I get on - and the standing-room only is a big
disincentive to riding. Additional times would also offer more flexibility, so that I have time to get my kids to school
and then catch the bus (which currently isn't possible). Thank you!

This is a key bus to make it practical to ride a bus and not drive to work. Please increase frequency of the FF2
Thank you for expanding this service - we need more transportation options to get between Boulder and Denver
for work!
I begged for the FF2 to return for years, and now increasing the frequency of service is going to be life-changing
for me. I take that bus to/from work, but an often afraid of missing it because there are so few FF2 busses per
day. Yes, I can always take an FF1, but the time penalty for doing so is tremendous. THANK YOU THANK YOU
THANK YOU for making it easier to get to work.

This increases my work flexibility while commuting from Denver to Boulder and will decrease transit times.
THANK YOU! I usually wait 20 minutes to take the FF2. More trips would make it easier to connect in a timely
manner. I think this would also help with the bus getting too full to take bikes. It's always a bit stressful not
knowing if I'll be able to board with a bike.
Please bring back the Boulder/Civic Center bus that goes down California!
I anticipate using the FF2 quite extensively to commute between Boulder and Denver (to work, from home) - so
wholeheartedly support any and all changes that increase the efficiency of those trips and expand the options to
use the bus for my transit
Ever since you cancelled this route, I stopped using RTD.
This route would enable me to start taking public transportation again.
I’d love to see a 7am option from mccaslin to union station and a later option past the current 5:16 bus from union
station. Buses have been standing room only and traffic has increased, an option earlier in the morning that the
7:26 and later than the 5:16 would be awesome! Thanks!!
I believe this has an amazing impact on traveling between Boulder and Denver because sometimes I miss the
connecting bus due to delays in traffic. I would love to ride the FF2
This is SO needed!! Thank you.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

This increase - and more during other hours - is very much needed! I've been on a few Flatiron Flyer buses that
were standing room only, and passengers were being turned away to wait for the next bus.

This is excellent. This bus is often full and standing room only by 7:30 at McCaslin station.
As for the westbound trip, consider a later bus after 5:30 PM. I often have to work later and the FF1 is still
crowded after 6:00 PM
I think the FF1 service needs expansion more urgently than FF2 but expanding FF2 is still a good idea.
YES, very necessary!
Support more FF2 buses.

Packet Pg. 281

These additions are very much needed, as the current buses have been running limited service, were frequently
late and full with passengers.
This bus is massively useful for me as I often go to Denver from Boulder in the evenings and the express service
the FF2 offers saves me tons of time. Thanks for adding more trips!

I miss the old FF2 frequency and look forward to more ability to ride it. Note that not everyone who rides it works
in Denver. I need to ride the E line and I would like to see more evening FF2 on the schedule. While I may be able
to get to my place of work by 8:30 on a combination of FF2 and E line, I can’t get back to Union station before 6
PM. It would be really nice to have some FF2 departures from Union station after 5:45 PM for those of us with
longer commutes.
I commute from Union Station to Boulder-Broadway/Euclid Monday-Friday and take the FF1 because the FF2 has
not been offering routes that arrive by/before 8:00am in Boulder. Most of my fellow travelers are members of the
University of Colorado Boulder community and need to arrive by 8:00am to campus. FF1 buses are standing
room only on the PM commute and run out of room for bicycles by US36/Wadsworth. Given this tremendously
high demand for FF1 and FF2 buses during peak commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am and departing
Boulder by 5:15pm), I am glad to see RTD is considering adding additional FF2 routes to support the high
demand for ridership. Adding additional FF2 routes during peak commuting hours (arriving in Boulder by 8:00am
and departing Boulder by 5:15pm) would free up room on the FF1 buses for travelers who are picking up the bus
after Union Station west-bound and free up room on the FF1 buses east-bound for travelers not going directly to
Union Station. Many riders use the FF1 route for Denver sporting events, leading to standing room only buses
and many disgruntled fans who want a smoother and more direct experience. Having additional FF2 routes would
also help mitigate the high levels of congestion on US36 during rush hour.
More interested in later evening service
As someone who commutes from Denver to Boulder several days a week, this change is huge for me. I now have
some flexibility in the morning on when I can leave, and more importantly I can actually take an express bus
home in the afternoon as well! Previously the afternoon Eastbound trip was way to early for someone who works
a typical 9-5 schedule.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

This is great! Hopefully the evening eastbound trips can be closer to 5:30, the current early return trip is too early
for a lot of typical work schedules.

I am so eager for the growth of FF2 service. My travel to Denver often takes me at a variety of times in the day as
I go for meetings. I look forward to seeing FF2 happen throughout the day and not just during peak times. It would
be beneficial to my ridership to see an FF2 after 5:30 but having more express service will be great.
While this does not yet meet the pre-covid FF2 levels, nor the service levels defined in the SOP, any increase in
service on the FF2 is welcome news. I can attest that crowding is an issue on this line, so these added trips are
sure to help. Many people in the Boulder area would use this service much more if the trips better aligned with
their schedules, which hopefully a service increase will aid in.
This is great news! I might start riding the bus again - I haven't since the pandemic because of elimination of the
morning FF4 eastbound. I would then appreciate the extra westbound FF2 options after work.

I often want to visit Boulder with friends, but we live in different areas if Denver, so we have to carpool in multiple
cars or drive separately. Having an express line to Boulder would allow us to visit Boulder more easily and ecofriendly. Additionally, many of my friends as well as my partner work in Boulder, but live in Denver, since Boulder
housing is too expensive. This express line would help cut down on car traffic if people could take the line straight
to Boulder for work.
This like was very useful during my college years before it was eliminated during the pandemic. As a now Denver
resident, I am happy to see it returning and am looking forward to riding it.
Love this the buses have been too full

Have the same bus run later until midnight or 1am.
This change would much appreciated! It can’t come soon enough. I’ve had to adjust my hours worked because
my typical bus kept getting full and couldn’t take on any more passengers, causing me to need to wait long
periods for another (slower FF1) bus.
Please add more express FF2 buses in the morning and evening times - this helps a lot with my commute from
downtown Boulder directly to union station without all of the other stops! Thank you!
yes and also bring back ff6 I miss the boulder junction station
While I personally will not be able to make use of this change for a very long time, it would make travelling from
union to boulder much more efficient
Super excited about this! I have a hard time catching the express with my kids school schedule, and this will allow
me to make the express easier. It’s also often very full- would be nice to have more space, not have to stand.
Increasing services is wonderful news!

I would love for the airport bus to also operate from Boulder Junction on the weekends.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

62%

I live in the neighborhood and if I could take the bus to the airport it would greatly cut down on the times I would
choose to drive. I moved to the neighborhood with the idea that there would be lots of transit options (bike, train,
bus, and walking). Please make this happen!
I currently take BOLT from Longmont to Boulder Downtown Station and then transfer to AB2 for service to DIA. It
appears that the weekday DIA service will now depart from Boulder Junction as AB3 (not sure I have got this
right). How will this affect BOLT travelers to and from Longmont? And it is different at weekends? All sounds
rather confusing, so would appreciate if you could elucidate. Thank you.
I don't understand why there is no weekend service between Boulder Junction and the airport. One would think
that would be a popular travel day. These trips should also be designed so that residents of Niwot or Longmont
could transfer near Canyon and 28th to get the bus to the airport. But having this service is very welcome

We need more weekend service from Boulder Junction.
My husband and I moved to Boulder Junction in 2015 primarily to take advantage of the new Boulder Junction
RTD Depot. We didn't own a car at the time, and leaving our condo to cross the street and board an RTD bus was
unbelievably convenient. We travel from DIA few times a year and visit Denver often, so when Boulder Junction
was open, we were using RTD very frequently! Unfortunately we had to buy a car after the Boulder Junction depot
was closed and public transportation diminished during Covid. So reopening the Boulder Junction Depot is great
news for us! I'm puzzled, however, why only M-F for the AB2? Wouldn't it make more sense to have the same for
all 7 days? We often travel to or from DIA on the weekends, and will only use RTD if it leaves from and returns to
Boulder Junction.
Please increase service this will help many access essential services, especially youth, low-income households,
and people with disabilities
add more routes to / from Boulder Junction

I enthusiastically endorse this change and hope it will be for all seven days to include the weekend. Thank you!

Thanks for considering!
I would use the bus route from Boulder Junction to the airport all the time if available!
This is great news! I’m glad to hear that the Boulder Junction station is reopening!
As I travel a lot, particularly on weekends, I would appreciate service to the airport on weekends from Boulder
Junction.
I’m as likely to use AB2 at Boulder Junction on weekends as I as weekdays, why not make AB2 changes for all
seven days?

As a resident of the Boulder Junction area, I would wholeheartedly welcome airport service back to this station. It
was incredibly convenient in the short time it was in service, and since then there has been a large increase in
residents due to the large-scale construction carried out in the last five years. This would eliminate the need to
drive to a bus station for many people.

It is difficult to evaluate the impact without knowing what the proposed schedule change is - there is currently no
way to check on how other connections will work. Additionally, I would like to see a return to longer spans of 15minute service on the E as was last done in the January 2024 schedule.

More detail regarding the schedule changes is necessary in order to be able to speak to how the changes would
impact me.
If the D line went to union I would have no need to ride the E line
You don’t tell me what the change will be — only that it is minor. And you didn’t define “minor,” so how do I
estimate how much I’ll be impacted?

This is the route I use most when going downtown for events, dining, etc. we always check the schedule in “realtime” before going to Colorado station.

While the proposed changes will not impact me - I moved to Boulder last fall - this line was horribly unreliable
when I lived in Denver.
Please follow schedule timing
Union station is a very appealing transfer point for me!
I only use the E Line as connection to the D Line when coming from Union Station. D Line servicing Union Station
makes the E Line irrelevant to me.
Don’t want E line delays again. Keep it every 15 mins please!
Hi! As a long time rider I just wanted to reaffirm how helpful and impactful it would be to increase the frequency of
the trains. The E line is scheduled every 15 minutes now as opposed to 30 minutes which is great! However
because of the timing for transfers from other trains, I can never make the E line on time. I come from the G line
and many of us G liners have to sprint to catch the E line before it leaves.
Have more train stations for the Ball Arena / Empower Field at Mile High during their events/concerts/sporting
events.
Consider public transportation options for a possible future IndyCar, or NASCAR/IMSA event?
this will be very positive provided all the work on the tracks is completed.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

BTW - Sat. June 14 was great going into town for the parade/protest. Horrible beyond belief trying the return trip
when Union Station/othet stops closed down without warning. We obliged the authorities by leaving the area late
afternoon but felt trapped at Union Station. We stopped for lunch (supporting downtown restaurants is important
to us) otherwise we would have “escaped” the turmoil. We WALKED from Union Station to Broadway to catch a
bus to the Broadway Station and then train home. Uber/Lyft became increasingly expensive as more people used
them. We are senior citizens but in really good physical shape - others may not have been to do this. I wonder if
an “emergency” route chance notice could have been sent to our phones. Or at least a public announcement so
we could have left earlier. We love RTD when it works!

If the H line northbound stops at Southmoor, then extend the E line's 15-minute frequency for later than 6pm. I
come home from work (Southmoor>10th/osage) at 9:30-10pm, and one train every 30 is highly inconvenient.
Promote more ridership along the corridor with later 15 min frequency hours!
It is unclear from your announcement what the changes are to the E line. I know that it is notoriously unreliable.
Last minute cancellations with no reasonable alternate transportation options. This has left
Me stranded at work on numerous occasions. Lack of operators seem to be a major cause.
I wouldn't have to take the E line should the D line go straight to Union Station, so this would be great.
I wish you would bring the line back to hampton that went to union again, it was fantastic for me

I take this train 5 days a week to the federal center for work because of it’s conveniency from downtown and it
would highly affect my performance at work and finances at home since I don’t have a car. I hope you will still be
able to schedule the W line for morning and evening commutes.
Does not have too much of an impact on me but would be great once again because I wouldn’t need to transfer to

I mainly ride the light rail on Sunday nights. I close the store I work at at 10 pm, if possible please increase time
between late night trips. I'd like to make it home before midnight if possible on Sunday. I get on at Decatur

The description is not clear. I'm assuming this change to "reinstate seasonal tripper service" means a reduction in
service at certain times of the year. This is harmful for individuals who live in the area and whose work schedules

It’s really ridiculous to have an hour in between busses. I would really like to see funding towards more busses
and avalibilities on routes like route 59, 116x and especially 24 that goes towards downtown. The mineral and
Wadsworth lines deserve to be back in action. South metro Denver has received almost nothing in terms of
consistent transit avalibility for those who don’t have a car.
Propose frequencies increases along this route should be implemented it as have been needed for a very long
time. Hopefully can be done in conjunction with Colfax P
BRT improvements

Good morning,
I would like to ask for the route 24 to go back to every 30 min schedule instead of running once an hour. Its hard
to connect with other routes to get where you need to go. My niece and nephew go to the Denver School of the
Arts. They both are in music. No school bus service for the south students. Only School bus service from the
North. For the last two years they've caught the Route 24 to the Route 20. Start at 650a to get to school by 850a.
Several times they have missed the route 20 because the driver of the 20 doesn't wait while their trying to cross
the street. Once even my nephew knocked on the door and the driver drove away. Instead of waiting for the next
bus my nephew walked to his school which is on Montview and Quebec. He's only 12. He has even walked home
from 17th and York to get to Unversity at Harvard, (carrying his instrument and backpack.) So he didn't have to
wait an hour for the Route 24. His Mother and I told him not to do that again. After school they have to wait close
to an hour at 17th and York for the route 24 then they get home around 6pm. Its a long day. Not only that while
their waiting for the Route 24 to go home, there are random times people stop and ask them if they need a ride or
to get in the car, especially to my niece she's 15. Their a single parent family, low income. They've worked hard
since they were little kids to be in music. Its hard and expensive. Its what lights up their life gives them an
opportunity to to something great in their life. Their Dream. Their happy kids but sometimes they get tired,
discouraged and want to give up. Give up music Their dream. To go to a regular school. It might not seem
important to you. Just sitting there waiting for a bus that runs every hour. It does. Please have the Route 24 go
back to every 30 minutes like it did before covid. Thank you! Have a Wonderful Day!
Sincerely,
Sotera Klomp

I'm going to keep making this point until it happens, we need bus route 24 to be on a 30 minute interval between
40th and Colorado Station and Hampden. I get that ridership is lower between Hampden and Orchard as it goes
through Cherry Hills and Greenwood Village, but this is also where I recommend that the 24 can have two
alternate destinations. You can have a bus southbound goes to C-470 and University as they all currently do, and
then you can have another bus southbound that can turn right on Hampden and go to Englewood Station and in
doing so giving Englewood, Littleton, and Sheridan residents an easier connection to University Blvd to go to
places like Cherry Creek Mall, the Denver Zoo, Museum of Nature and Science as it goes back north, it would be
a great benefit.
Glad that the route has extended time for evening use but once an hour still makes taking the bus difficult.
Ridership will only increase if the bus schedule is more convenient.

What is SEASONAL TRIPPER SERVICE? I keep hoping and praying for 30 minute service on the 24. No route
should be hourly. It’’s simply not useable this way.
Bring back every 30 minute service on this route. Running it only hourly makes it pretty useless for me, so I end
driving a few miles and parking at a light rail station garage rather than using #24 for my connection

I really like the 83D is more accessible on the weekdays. Would like it if it was available on the weekends

I do not know what the exact changes are. But running the service every 15 minutes would have a huge positive

Improve route by extending 76 to Lafayette pnr.
I am hoping the 76 bus time will not be arriving at southwest plaza at the exact same time as the 35 and 59. It
makes it incredibly difficult to catch a transfer and most of the time the 76 bus driver will not wait one moment for
the 59 to get off. They immediately take off when the only other stop is for 7400 w long drive. It would be a huge
benefit if they didn’t all arrive at the exact same time. Thanks

Because the 76 line operates only every 1/2 hour, stops at Wadsworth Station need to be optimized so that the W
line does not arrive just as the bus is pulling away, and so that the 76 bus doesn't arrive just as the W line train is
pulling away. A shift of 7 1/2 minutes would make the transfer much more efficient.

The route runs Monday to Friday only, not on weekends
What exactly are the minor changes? If off by 5 minutes I will not be able to catch my bus. Will there be any times
after 5:45? I can get downtown but don't get off until 6pm and then have to find another way to get home.
The 116x is generally always late.
With just 3 departures in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, any change is an issue.
There needs to be more funding on this bus route. South metro Denver deserves more than two busses a day—
I’d like to see funding go towards south metro bus lines

It is the only bus I can catch to get to the train so I can go work during the week. On the weekends when it doesn't
run I understand there is a 2 mile walk to the closest store and I have accepted that
I use this route pretty regularly and having changes too often can impact my work schedule. Please make
adjustments as needed for rider needs but also, please do not decrease the route.
This route is right near my house and it very rarely has any buses going. I want a bus to be there more frequently
at least once an hour off of Sims and Quincy. It is very unfair that this is only an expressvuff that only goes in the
morning and afternoon and has no other time that it connects

I agree with this service change. I would push for additional service on the 104l such as increased service, the
early morning routes are almost standing room only
Good customer focus
Please do this! I work at the airport and several times I have been stranded there because operations required
me to work later and I missed the last bus. This would really help many of us airline employees who depend on
the 104L. I am strongly in support of this, thank you!

I use the 104L to get to the aiport twice a month, maybe even 3 or 4, but however, I always take the A Line from
DEN because the 104L Doesn’t align with N Line Northbound trips. The North AND South N Line trips both depart
5 mins before the 104L Bus arrives at Thornton Crossroads. However if you think how would people get to Wagon
Road, they could use the 120 Bus Line if they use the N Line to Eastlake. South N Line riders would now travel up
to Eastlake and transfer their to get to Wagon Road. Thanks!!!!
I only use to go to work
Please add more late night and early morning trips! I regularly take this route to the airport, and I worry about a
flight getting delayed past the last bus and having to spend the night at the airport.

This a core route in the city. It needs to be frequent.
The survey did not provide an opportunity for input on other routes. The northbound GS afternoon service needs
a 6:30 a.m. but and a 3:30 pm bus.
I would love to see more efforts put in to decrees bus bunching on this route. The existing scheduled frequency is
great but if busses just end up nose to tail its not as useful and its a waist of valuable service hours. Infrastructure
improvements on the Broadway corridor are much needed given the over 1 million riders this service carried in
2024.

Please don’t ruin it like the 120L. The 120L transfer was good (N Line to 120L and vice versa) but it was ruined
because the previous service change from 2024, said it would better align with N Line, but it didnt, made it worse
in fact. The 120L bus now departs 2 mins before the N Train arrives so theres a connection lost. The 120L bus
also arrives 5 mins AFTER the N train departs so i do NOT know how thats a better connection. Please fix the
120L and also still make it so the 120 Bus departs and arrives at the same time as the 120L at Eastlake so it
matches with the N Line, AND 120L to 120 and vice versa. Thanks!!!!
The 120 should be at least 20-minute frequency to permit for ease of transfer from any FF1.
Adding earlier weekday westbound 120 line buses would help commuter traffic getting to the US 36 park n ride,
as well.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

While it's good that you are going to fix the timing for the buses so that they can connect to the N-Line in time
without having to wait 30 minutes for another, it's not enough. Route 120 also needs to be on a 30 minute interval
all day on the whole route, because there's a lot of retail and business on 120th Ave and apartments and it would
benefit people in that corridor to have more frequent bus service.

I hope that frequency is increased and it is still easy to transfer to Union Station, as well.
The ability to get to the east side of downtown and Uptown from the west side without having to transfer to the
Mall Ride would be helpful sometimes
I was so annoyed when the route got cut back to stop at Union. I started walking to a further bus stop to take a
route that actually went through downtown. Thanks for fixing!
This is long overdue. You need to increase the frequency of this route immediately. Once every hour is
unacceptable.

The LX2 expands my options in getting to Denver for meetings. While I need to get dropped off at Niwot Road

I might use this 2-3 times per year, but I'm very skeptical of how people will be relying on this route. I hope I'm
wrong, but I think a bus to DIA would be much more heavily used than this.
I miss the pre-covid express busses to and from Longmont. This will reduce my commute time.
Running during the proposed times southbound does not get me to work by 7:30am. I was hoping when the LXs
started up again, they would be convenient as before.
More Express buses southbound are seriously needed later in the morning, afternoons, and in the evenings and
northbound in the afternoon and into the evenings.
Thank you for restoring the direct Longmont/Denver express bus service!

The LX is another favorite bus
Better regional connectivity without a car
I was unable to find a list of stops for this route. Will riders from Lafayette have a nearby stop available to them?
As a resident of Niwot, I often get dropped off at 287 to take the LX to Denver. Having LX2 service as an option
speeds up my commute to Denver. This will ease my commute for meetings and events in Denver and give me
more options for travel. I wish it was a bit easier for me to bike or access the 287/Niwot Road bus stop but when I
can get a ride it is such a good travel option

I would like to see a service change that gets a guaranteed arrival to Union Station by 7:40 for people who need
to be at work by 8:00. A couple of ways to do that: (1) return the start time to 5 minutes earlier like it was prior to
the change in fall of 2024. Even though this was only a 5 minute change, we now get to Union Station 10-15
minutes later because of increased traffic at that time of day or (2) eliminate the 3 stops between South Public &
Miner’s and when the bus gets on 287. I ride the bus almost every weekday and rarely see people using those
stops. Eliminating those and letting the bus get on 287 would cut minutes off the commute and residents from that
area still have nearby stops to use (South Public & Miners or the stops on 287)

Even greater frequency should be implemented especially in conjunction with coming Federal BRT and improve
connections with light rail at Englewood
It is unfair that this line does not go all the way to Sims off of Hampden. It starts too far east
Increasing the frequency of this bus line would greatly improve the quality of access for individuals trying to travel
up Hampden via the University and Hampden intersection

Packet Pg. 319

2.15.H.g

Rerouting the 35 seems like an unnecessary service reduction. The 35's service area and the Hampden frontage
road has a lot of transit dependent people who will be left with no transit service.
I would advise against terminating at Wads & Hampden and instead continue the trip to SW Plaza due to many
people who use that section.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

Okay, two things. First of all, like with how it's a bad idea to change up route 30 to serve Littleton, it's just as bad
that route 35 is going to be taking over the existing path that route 30 takes between Federal Blvd and Wadsworth
because by doing that, it means that the service along the frontage road on the south side of 285 is about to be
eliminated thus removing the only bus service people over there have, likewise it will also no longer be possible to
take route 35 to Fort Logan and people would be forced to transfer to route 51 at Sheridan Blvd which does not
serve that stretch on Sundays, so again leave route 30 and 35 the way they are in that part of metro Denver.
Second, for all the bus stops east of Englewood Station, you need to remove the black "No Weekends or RTD
Holidays" labels you still have on the bus stop signs so that people know for certain that the buses are actually
going to arrive on weekends and holidays, because people might be getting fooled by them and then it
inadvertently lowers ridership when they walk away. I don't want to lose service because not enough people were
riding thanks to getting misinformed by those leftover labels.

This bus should be a circular route that runs every 20 minutes once the BRT is finished. It feels redundant to have
10 15 and 20 all running parallel. How can folks on 12th get to Rino or give points?
I don't know what the exact changes are so I can't write to the extent of this change. I would like to see more
frequency and more bus routes run more often on weekends though. I don't own a car so I often use the bus to
run errands.
please increase the times that this bus runs , it only runs every hour , it serves areas that other busses do not
serve , and having it run every 30mins would be extremely helpful especially around the lowery campus that has

Please reinstate service west of downtown on the 20 For years RTD has promised to return the 20 to pre

density along the 17 th avenue corridor has made the need only increase. Three times early in the morning and

Even if students are no longer using this route to get to school during the summer months, the 20 buses during

All that your website says is "Reinstate seasonal tripper service." I have no idea what that means. I have a copy
of the 20 schedule, and the map, both from RTD and there is zero mention of what a "seasonal tripper service" is.

With so many routes serving Lincoln and Colfax, why can’t the 6 directly serve Denver Health, down to Santa Fe?
Makes much more sense.. good change for customer focus via feedback
While I applaud the extension of service to CCA, the routing should carefully balance circuitousness and utility.
Buses should be routed from Aurora Metro Center on Alameda Drive and cross Alameda Parkway to stop directly
at the Aurora Municipal Campus (in front of the library and city hall) so people do not have to walk from Alameda
Parkway or Chambers to reach city services and attractions. From Chambers to CCA, buses should use 1st

does not directly aid me, it could ease congestion on other times
Anything to increase this line is good. Best deal and service in Denver!
The added trip for the AT/ATA bus route will be very beneficial for getting from Aurora to the airport by providing
more options to utilize RTD to get to DIA
This bus needs to run every 30 minutes. It is very convenient going to the airport but if you just miss it returning
home you have to wait a whole hour. If it ran every 30 minutes we would take it every single trip.

Please decrease fares to the airport. $10 is too expensive compared to taking E470 toll road from south Denver
to the airport. When it costs $8 to take the toll road and save nearly an hour in total journey time, no one has
incentive to use RTD.

Rerouting the 30 seems like an unnecessary service reduction. The 30's service area has a lot of transit
dependent people who will be negatively affected by this change.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

For this one I speak less for myself as I do for people who rely on this route to go from Federal Blvd west to
Sheridan Blvd or Wadsworth. While it's good that you want more continuous service north of Evans from
downtown Littleton that route 29 does not currently provide, re-routing route 30 is the wrong way to go about this
because it will mean that people who rely on this route as a means of going to places like Bear Valley to connect
with route 51 or Wadsworth to connect with route 76 would now have to make an additional transfer to route 35 to
keep going where they want to go and adding more time to their trip, and same thing from the other direction. I
think it's better to leave route 30 alone and instead turn route 31 into a Federal Blvd Crosstown route that starts at
Littleton Blvd on the south end and then will go as far north as Westminster Station, it could be at least a half-hour
interval between downtown Littleton and Evans, with more frequent service starting at Evans as it currently exists.
It will give people in Littleton, Sheridan, and southwest Englewood more continuous service north of where they
live but not impact people relying on another route to go places they need to go.

Every year the service changes for the Boulder school routes take place at the end of August. School starts
August 13. So for the first two weeks of school, when you want the kids to get used to their schedule before
school gets too intense, they can't catch a bus at a reasonable time. This happens EVERY YEAR. How has RTD
not figured this out yet?

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

60%

Yes, this does help support student movement by transit. Good decision.
The scheduling of the 204 service should be corrected to better connect with transfers at Downtown Boulder
Station. For example, there is currently a southbound bus that arrives at DBS at 7:06 AM on weekdays - exactly
when the FF2 departs for Union Station. This is a missed connection that I would for sure use if it was better
planned.
While I appreciate adding an additional route to this bus route, I’d like to see weekend service along the southern
portion of this route. The 204 route runs closer to the greatly underserved 28th street corridor than the skip. As a
south boulder resident, I’d appreciate being able to ride the 204 on weekends and get better connections to
Downtown Boulder station, the 205, and the 28th street corridor.

Since the May 2025 service changes, transfer timings between DASH and 228 have become flaky. The transfers
used to be well timed such that you could transfer between DASH and 228 going any direction, and the new route
for the 228 has made vehicles have reduced schedule adherence at the select transfer stops (S Boulder & Main,
Via Appia & S Boulder, W Pine & Via Appia).

Finally, a little bit of feedback on the latest May 2025 changes, since I think it's relevant to making more changes
here: the southbound 228 service pattern is extremely confusing. There's two abandoned stops along Mcaslin
which people are still using for boarding & alighting, although one of them sends you a wrong way. These are
fairly nice stops with good shelters and space to wait. The new stops in Downtown Superior have no amenities
and are far worse.
Ultimately I'd recommend abandoning the new stops in Downtown Superior. Downtown Superior has great
pedestrian accessibility from Mcaslin Boulevard already, and I didn't mind walking there from the old stops, but
the new route has caused a total mess. As someone who goes to Downtown Superior, the new alignment has not
been helpful to me.

Attachment: Attachment G (5169 : August 2025 Service Change)

That being said, I do think the stop at Mcaslin Station Gate C is an important stop, and an overall improvement.
Due to the DDI configuration, the bridge stops have poor pedestrian accessibility, and this helps a lot. I'd like to
see service routed here in a pattern which results in better schedule adherence for DASH transfers.

I appreciate the changed and am excited to hopefully see more on time busses. However the frequency of only
once an hour is not feasible for commuting outside of Longmont. If on bus is delayed, there is no change you will
make it to your destination on time. I would like to see the busses run more frequently, that is the only Amway
commuters will feel comfortable relying on the buses

It would be much more helpful if the time could be extended to 8 and or if the bus could also run on sundays :)
All buses in Longmont should be available until 10 pm for M-S. Sunday's until 8pm.
Aligns better with work schedule, provides greater transit options; Sunday service would be even better
This would make my life so much easier I'm always saying that I wish the 323 either ran a little earlier or a little
later. I take this bus twice a day four or five times a week.

Changing the 135's frequency during peak hours is really helpful to me, but I feel like it should be 30 minutes all
the time, unless it's 30 minutes from 8am-8pm, or around that time. I've avoided taking public transit in the areas
it serves purely because of the hour long frequency, and making it 30 minutes during peak is helpful, but I would
ride a lot more of it was 30 minutes all of the time.
I also think the 169 should be increased alongside this. It is a very important route and there's no reason why it
should only be every 60 minutes. A lot more people (including myself) would ride it if it came at least every 30
minutes.

More buses to Evergreen!! Some that just go from federal center
I use this route pretty regularly and having changes too often can impact my work schedule. Please make
adjustments as needed for rider needs but also, please do not decrease the route.

This route does not go frequently enough to other areas of the Denver Metro like South Sims off of the 116x.
There needs to be more times where this can meet up so that people can go to evergreen easier
unclear on how this can occur. would prefer the similar timing of every 20 minutes from Fed Center
Why has EV been renamed to ES going Eastbound in the mornings?

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand Contract Extensions

July 16, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into sixmonth contract extension amendments with existing providers for the Access-on-Demand (AoD) program
effective January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2026, raising the not-to-exceed amount from $37.8 to
$42.2 million.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In January 2023, RTD’s AoD program, a premium, supplemental paratransit service available via four
contracted private providers, was expanded to all eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR) customers. These
contracts were for a three-year contract term that is set to expire December 31, 2025.
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery in February 2024. The on-site
review was conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in
a holistic review of the paratransit program, including both the AoD program and the AaR program. As
part of the review, changes to the AoD program were suggested.
Staff has developed a draft solicitation for new AoD contracts, but finalization is dependent on Board
approval of recommended AoD program modifications being recommended by staff concurrently with
this action. Staff will incorporate the approved modifications into the solicitation and intends to advertise
no later than January 1, 2026. This will allow sufficient time for proposers to develop proposals, for the
Board of Directors to consider recommended actions to effectuate the contract extensions, and for the
execution of contracts prior to the term date of the extensions. Program modifications approved by the
Board will be incorporated into these amendments if this recommended action is adopted.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priority of
Customer Excellence. This recommendation ensures near-term fiscal sustainability by incorporating
program modifications adopted by the Board and allows customers to continue to use AoD while new
contracts are solicited.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of AoD services effective January 1 through June 30, 2026, will be included in

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 GM-CEO Short-term Goals

July 7, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve, pursuant to the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) performance
framework adopted in January 2024 in alignment with the Board’s employment agreement with the
GM/CEO, the proposed short-term SMART goals for the performance period commencing January 1,
2026, and continuing through November 8, 2026.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
Debra A. Johnson, GM/CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the performance assessment framework adopted by the Board during the monthly Board
meeting held on January 30, 2024, the Board is responsible for motivating, assessing, and rewarding
the agency’s GM/CEO in relation to short-term and long-term performance. The GM/CEO’s short-term
performance has been assessed on an annual basis.
The attainment of short-term goals directly tied to agency Strategic Initiatives is a critical element of the
GM/CEO’s annual performance, as is performance related to core job duties and values.
On December 4, 2023, the Board adopted a fifth amendment to the contract to adjust the Board’s
annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which the GM/CEO will be evaluated in the coming
year from December 31 to January 31.
On December 10, 2024, the Board adopted an eighth amendment to the contract, which included the
following terms, among other provisions:
•

•

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,

Packet Pg. 364

2.16.J

•
•

and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period
Beginning January 1, 2025, the Board must meet with GM/CEO Johnson each quarter to discuss
her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals
For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is not eligible for a Cost-of-Living Adjustment; however, the Board will
endeavor to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the Compensation
Philosophy

In May 2025, upon request from Chair Bouquet, the Board Office solicited from Board members their
feedback regarding their thoughts on potential agency priorities for the short-term planning horizon.
During the Board’s retreat held on Saturday, June 7, 2025, the Board and GM/CEO Johnson discussed
several themes derived from the feedback garnered, which subsequently informed the short-term goals
identified in this Recommended Action.
DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, the purpose of this Recommended Action is to align the committee
around the proposed short-term SMART goals for the performance period commencing January 1, 2026,
and continuing through November 8, 2026 (2025-26 performance period).
The proposed goals for the 2025-26 performance period are as follows:
Short-term Goal 1 – Customer Experience/Welcoming Transit Environment: No later than
October 2, 2026, increase overall customer satisfaction by 5% for both RTD’s fixed-route bus
service and fixed-route rail service (33% of goal); to increase favorable customer survey
responses by 5% from CY2025 to CY2026 in relation to survey questions pertaining to
customers’ perception of feeling safe and secure aboard light rail vehicles (33% of goal); to
develop and launch by June 30, 2026, a mystery transit customer program to evaluate and
enhance elements of the overall customer experience utilizing transit, including but not limited
to service quality, employee courtesy, accuracy of information provided, and vehicle
cleanliness and to provide at least three months of baseline performance data with respect to
these criteria (33% of goal).
Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
and improve performance metrics related to overall customer satisfaction as well as to promote a
welcoming transit environment.
According to customer survey data garnered in April 2025, overall satisfaction with RTD’s service
delivery stood at 76% for bus and 75% for combined rail service. Paratransit service received very high
customer satisfaction ratings, 86% and 96% for Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand, respectively.
Leveraging data from the 2025 Customer Excellence survey for fixed-route services, 69% of light rail
customers reported feeling safe and secure while aboard rail vehicles, up from 62% in 2024. A key

Packet Pg. 365

2.16.J

driver analysis of the survey responses identified perception of personal security aboard light rail vehicles
as a key opportunity area to increase overall satisfaction with RTD’s services.
In comparison, a significantly higher proportion of commuter rail customers, 82%, reported feeling safe
and secure while aboard rail vehicles, up from 62% in 2024, indicating that prior efforts to create and
maintain a welcoming transit environment have yielded significant improvements.
RTD has historically leveraged customer and community surveys to garner qualitative data related to
customer-facing aspects of service delivery. Mystery customer programs in the public transit space
typically gauge elements such as service quality, safety, cleanliness, and efficiency of the transportation
system objectively from a customer’s perspective.
Short-term Goal 2 – Ridership: To increase systemwide boardings by 3% from the period
commencing October 1, 2025, and continuing through September 30, 2026.
Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics tied to community
perceptions of the value RTD provides to the Denver metro region and of RTD’s provision of service to
major activity centers, as well as the State’s visionary ridership increase goal of 6%.
RTD continues to optimize service levels and is incrementally approaching the level of service delivery
contemplated in the System Optimization Plan (SOP), with a planning horizon running 2022-2027.
Annual boardings totaled 65,230,065 in 2024, a slight increase from the 65,175,290 boardings seen in
2023. The Board has established a 2025 short-term performance goal for the GM/CEO to increase
boardings by 3% from the period commencing October 1, 2024, and ending September 30, 2025. The
goal for the 2025-26 performance period builds upon the GM/CEO’s performance goal related to
increased ridership for the performance period commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing through
October 15, 2025.
Short-term Goal 3 – Reliability: No later than October 1, 2026, to complete rail reconstruction
work within budget for the rail segment between the West Colfax Avenue and 7th Street
intersection and the Denver Convention Center (50% of goal); to achieve 98% systemwide
service availability for bus, light rail, commuter rail, and complementary paratransit modes
(50% of goal).

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to enhance system reliability and to improve
performance metrics related to service delivery.
The Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project commenced construction in 2024. Phases 2-4 of the project
are anticipated to recommence in Q1 2025, with related rail reconstruction work taking place
commencing September 2025 for the Kalamath light rail segment. Phase 3 of the project involves the
rail segment between the West Colfax Avenue and 7th Street intersection and the Denver Convention

Packet Pg. 366

2.16.J

Center. Note that the agency announced at the inception of the project in 2024 that the numbering of
Phases 2 through 4 was not intended to imply the order in which the phases would be completed.
Maintaining assets in a state of good repair is critical to ensuring consistent, frequent, reliable service.
Service availability is the percentage of trips operated as compared to trips scheduled. Maintaining a high
level of service availability across the transit network ensures customers have reliable access to key
activity centers, such as places of employment, schools, medical facilities, and leisure and entertainment
destinations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Recommended Action; funding to support strategies
and initiatives to produce the outcomes identified herein will be included in the 2026 Proposed Budget.

Access-on-Demand Program Modifications

July 16, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve modifications to the supplemental, premium Access-on-Demand
(AoD) service for RTD’s paratransit customers as described herein effective October 1, 2025.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 27, 2024, Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO, commissioned a peer review of
RTD’s paratransit service delivery, to be conducted by subject-matter experts selected by the American
Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA convened the peer review panel, which included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the months-long review, the
panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride
(AaR) service, the agency’s complementary American with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service, and
RTD’s AoD premium supplemental paratransit service.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
The on-site portion of the review was conducted between May 20 and 24, 2024. In advance of the onsite visit, RTD provided the panelists with documentation for their edification. While on-site at RTD
facilities, the panelists assessed RTD’s paratransit operations through further documentation review,
field observations, and a series of briefings and interviews with agency staff, contractors, paratransit
customers, and community stakeholders. The final report formalized the panelists’ observations and
recommendations.
Staff provided the Board with a summary of program modifications that were developed as a result of
recommendations from the APTA peer review in November 2024, and after extensive public feedback,

Packet Pg. 368

2.16.K

data analysis, industry research, and a survey of other transit agencies, as well as input provided from
the Board, several iterations of recommendations have been explored.
DISCUSSION
Based on continued Board guidance, public outreach, and community feedback, staff is recommending
the following modifications to the AoD program:
•
•
•
•
•

$6.50 upfront base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
$20/trip subsidy
60 trips/month cap
Service area that mirrors AaR
Service hours that mirror AaR

The Access-On-Demand service area shall also include all origins and destinations that lie within threequarters (¾) of a mile of any RTD fixed-route bus service, including commuter and regional bus routes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact of the program modifications presented here is a reduction of
approximately 36.5 percent in yearly program costs for a total projected expense of $13,437,217 in
2025.

AoD Preferred Scenario (cont’d)
§ RTD provides the Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAV) for most trips
that require WAVs

• AoD trips with WAV vehicles reduce availability for AaR, a federally-required paratransit program,
to operate

• AoD use of RTD’s WAVs result in longer wait times for on-demand trips
• Providing WAV service reduces capacity on AaR by 17%

§ 95% of AoD trips completed in 2024 would still be eligible for the service with the AaR
boundary in effect
