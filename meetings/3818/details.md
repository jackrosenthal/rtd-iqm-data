## IV. July Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Bouquet noted the following changes to the July 29, 2025, Board Meeting agenda. Move items forward on the agenda to come immediately after External Entity Reports and before our committee reports. Those two items are the Access-on-Demand Program Modifications and the Collective Bargaining Agreement with ATU-1001.

The third change is to move the Access-on-Demand Contract Extensions, currently listed as Item I on the agenda from Unanimous Consent to Recommended Actions. This change is being requested as the item was not approved unanimously at the Committee level and the Board Office inadvertently placed the item on the consent agenda.

Director Nicholson suggested Item K, Recognition of Reverend Wade Blank via Honorary Name for Civic Center Station item be moved to after the Access-on- Demand item. The Chair acknowledged the change.

Motion:              Director Whitmore made the motion to move the agenda as amended to the Full board at the July 29, 2025, Board Meeting.

Director  Benker seconded the motion.

Chair Bouquet declared the motion PASSED.
