Resolution Regarding Waiver of Sovereign Immunity and Indemnification of Claims

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the attached resolution. The resolution commits to (i) waiving
sovereign immunity for and indemnifying the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) for claims
arising out of RTD’s acquisition of, and construction and operation on a portion of
the UP’s Moffat Subdivision for RTD’s Gold Line; and, (ii) purchasing insurance in
amounts specified to provide funds in the event the need for indemnification arises.
RTD by the attached Resolution waives sovereign immunity to the extent it may be
applicable up to the amount of available insurance and agrees to indemnify the UPRR
for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and/or use of the property acquired for
RTD’s Gold Line from UP’s Moffat subdivision, and obligates RTD to purchase
insurance for various types of claims. Liability insurance in an amount up to $200
million (two hundred million dollars) during construction and $400 million (four
hundred million dollars) after commencement of operations is required, as is
automobile liability insurance in similar amounts. Railroad protective insurance is
required on the East and Gold Line Corridors. Pollution liability insurance in the
amount of $5 million (five million dollars) per claim is required along with other
insurance applicable to construction projects or required by law. The resolution
acknowledges that indemnity and insurance requirements may increase based on
changes in law or market conditions.
