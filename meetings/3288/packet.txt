January 6, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to ratify the 2022 Standing Committee appointments.
REPRESENTATIVE
Chair Buzek
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2021, the Board Office solicited feedback from the Board on which standing
committees each Director was interested in serving in 2022. The Board Office compiled responses from
the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 6, 2021 Executive
Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:
Finance and Planning Committee
Bob Broom
Peggy Catlin
Shelley Cook
Erik Davidson
Bobby Dishell
Lynn Guissinger
Troy Whitmore
Operations and Safety Committee
Julien Bouquet
Shontel Lewis
