C. Updates

• Updated RTD DBE Program Plan June 2014
Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, introduced Zamy Silva, Small
Business Office Manager, to update the Directors on the RTD Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise (DBE) Program Plan.
Zamy Silva reminded the Directors that RTD’s DBE Program Plan, which
describes how the District manages and oversees the DBE program, must be
approved by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). This plan must be
revised and updated as necessary.
The Civil Rights Department recently updated the DBE Program Plan in the
following areas:
 Submitting a “Fostering Small Business Plan” to FTA in accordance
with new regulations established in 2011.
 Incorporating a 19% goal of DBE participation and methodology to
the plan. This 19% was submitted by RTD in August, 2013 and
recently approved by FTA.
 Incorporating policies and procedures to monitor sub-recipient DBE
compliance.

• Civil Rights Outreach
Kenn Hardin informed the Directors that his department hosted the Regional
Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (Las Vegas). Chair Sisk,
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede, General Manager Phil Washington, and
City and County of Denver Economic Development Director Chris Martínez
welcomed the delegation. They were interested in how RTD operates the
DBE, Small Business Enterprise (SBE), and Workforce Initiative Now (WIN)
programs. During a tour of Denver Union Station (DUS), the conversation
focused on RTD’s best practices.
At the DUS DBE Advisory Council meeting, the Civil Rights Department
recognized top performing contractors, DBEs, and SBEs who worked on
DUS. Helga Grunerud, Hispanic Contractors of Colorado’s Executive
Director, assisted in presenting the awards. Rick Clarke, Assistant Manager
of Capital Programs, General Manager Phil Washington, and Committee
Chair Rivera-Malpiede attended the event.
Kenn Hardin acknowledged the WIN participants’ participation during the
Public Private Partnership (P3) Roundtable on May 9, 2014. He pointed out
how the WIN program positively affects the life of the participants.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Stakeholders Event was held at
Dick’s Sporting Goods Park on May 28, 2014. Over 300 people
participated. RTD explained to the attendants the many projects and
opportunities available to small businesses contractors. He thanked
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede for helping secure the venue.
The Civil Rights Department employs students from Arrupe Jesuit High
School as part of the school’s Corporate Work Study Program. This year
marked the first graduate to work with RTD. The District was recognized as
a corporate sponsor of the program during the graduation ceremony.
The Civil Rights Department recently hosted a networking session/pre-bid
event for the Central Park Park-n-Ride. DBEs were given clear directions on
the project. The DBE goal for this project is 27%.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede thanked Kenn Hardin and the Civil Rights
staff for their work. She informed the Directors of her participation on most
of the mentioned events. She finds it overwhelming how many lives this
department influences on behalf of RTD. She considers the Civil Rights
Department the backbone of our community.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Washington reminded the Directors of the email sent announcing
RTD as the recipient of the APTA Innovation Award. The WIN program, along with
the MAX program and the Leadership Academy, was one of the biggest
components for the selection.
He also informed the Directors that the Clinton Global Initiative, which will meet in
Denver from June 23-25, 2014, asked RTD to participate in the Infrastructure
Workshop. They also asked the District to develop a WIN Program template. If
chosen, the Clinton Initiative would collaborate to promote the template nationally.
