#### A. Adoption of the Pension Plan Contribution

#### C. January 2021 Service Change Proposals Final

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the January 2021 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

The January 2021 service changes are pandemic plan 2, intended to be temporary.  The cuts and changes in this plan and the original pandemic plan will be revisited by the Board no later than September 2021.  In the meanwhile, RTD will establish, in coordination with local jurisdictions, a documented process for restoring or restructuring suspended and reduced services.  This process will use the January 2020 run board as a baseline, also considering the changes in transit use and lessons learned in Reimagine RTD and during the pandemic.

This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:

Core Goal #1 - Successful delivery of Transit Service.
