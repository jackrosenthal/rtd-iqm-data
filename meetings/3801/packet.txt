BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Authorizations for General Manager and CEO - Central Park
Development

June 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to negotiate and
execute one or more option agreements, ground leases, and other documents related to the development
of the real property located at 3801 N. Ulster Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property), with Ulysses
Development Group.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2010 and 2012, RTD purchased 19.6 acres for what is now Central Park Station on the A Line
corridor for $2,642,129 with federal grant funds. The property serves as the operating base for nine bus
routes and the park-and-ride (PnR) contains 1,521 spaces. The PnR is part of RTD’s parking
management system but is not maintained by RTD or Denver Transit Operators.
In November 2023, RTD issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) seeking a developer to develop
affordable housing on the PnR’s westernmost parcel, located at 3801 N. Ulster Street, on the southwest
corner of Smith Road and Ulster Street (as defined above, the Property) in Denver. The six-acre Property
has 651 transit parking spaces with very low parking utilization and very high development potential.
RTD selected Ulysses Development Group (UDG) as the potential developer of the Property based on
their ambitious affordable housing program, their access to financial resources, and their development
experience.
In June 2024, the Board authorized RTD to enter into an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with
UDG to address 1) negotiation and design schedule, 2) project financing, 3) development plan (density,
use, affordability), and 4) RTD maintenance and operations requirements. The June 2024 Board
authorization is attached to this report for reference. RTD and UDG executed the ENA in September
2024.
Pursuant to the ENA, UDG has committed to develop, in several phases, at least 500 apartment units, of
which no fewer than 250 will be affordable to households making up to 60% of area median income.
The development will also include public open space and other community benefits uses such as a
potential childcare center (collectively, the Project).

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

DISCUSSION
Adoption of this recommended action will enable the agency to move forward with the Project, creating
much-needed housing near transit, improving transit access, and generating revenue for RTD consistent
with the agency’s Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy and in furtherance of the agency’s
2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
For the next phase of this Project, RTD will grant UDG an option or options (each, an Option) pursuant
to an Option Agreement to enter into one or more ground leases (each, a Ground Lease) for portions of
the Property in phases according to the terms set forth in the Option.
The exercise of an Option and the execution of a Ground Lease will only be authorized to take place if
the following conditions are met:
1. UDG and RTD have agreed on the overall scope of the applicable Project phase on the Property at
affordability levels consistent with eligibility requirements for Low Income Housing Tax Credits
(LIHTC) and/or other affordable housing financing, if applicable.
2. UDG has obtained all entitlements from the City and County of Denver necessary to construct the
applicable Project phase on the Property.
3. UDG has obtained LIHTC and/or other financing necessary to construct the applicable Project phase.
4. UDG and RTD have completed and agreed on an appraisal for the applicable Project phase, which
appraisal shall be used to determine fair market value and the ground lease payments under the
applicable Ground Lease in accordance with this Board approval and RTD policy.
5. UDG and RTD have agreed on a form of Ground Lease for the applicable Project phase.
If RTD and UDG are unable to negotiate one or more Ground Leases or any other necessary agreements,
RTD will retain all property rights and any subsequent decisions regarding the Property would be subject
to Board approval. Staff will keep the Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The approval of the Option Agreement would provide RTD with potential future ground lease payments if
the Project is successful.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Kalamath Rail Reconstruction Project Contract Award

June 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with RailWorks Partners LP (RailWorks) for the full-depth reconstruction of the Kalamath light
rail intersection in downtown Denver, in an amount not to exceed $3,585,990.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Central Corridor (Corridor) is the oldest rail segment in the agency’s light rail system, having
opened for revenue service on Friday, October 7, 1994. The Corridor extends 5.3 miles from the I25·Broadway Station to the 30th·Downing Station. With the Corridor having been in continuous revenue
service for over 30 years, several paved track segments along the Corridor require full-depth
reconstruction, and associated rail infrastructure requires replacement as part of long-term operations
and maintenance of RTD’s assets to improve safety and mobility, address deteriorating transit
infrastructure, and extend the design life of the agency’s key transportation assets.
Maintenance of assets in a state of good repair by leveraging sound asset management principles
furthers RTD’s 2024-25 Strategic Initiative of Back to Basics. These principles involve identifying,
funding, and implementing projects to replace assets as they meet their expected useful life.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value and Employee Ownership.
Under this contract, approximately 700 feet of double track of the Corridor west of north Speer
Boulevard and the crossing through Kalamath Street will be reconstructed. The Kalamath rail
reconstruction project, which is being completed in advance of the recommencement of the rail
reconstruction project in the Central Business District, includes custom fabricated curved rail segments
and special parts that have been procured separately.

Packet Pg. 20

1.D.2

The Kalamath rail reconstruction project is anticipated to commence September 2, 2025, and continue
through November 22, 2025, subject to city permitting, weather, and other factors that can impact
construction.
Solicitation Overview
On April 7, 2025, RTD advertised a solicitation for construction services related to the full-depth
reconstruction of the Kalamath crossing. Proposals were received May 16, 2025.
After evaluation of the proposals based upon the published evaluation criteria, the evaluation panel
unanimously recommended RailWorks for award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the contract, in an amount not to exceed $3,585,990, is included in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Light Rail Operating Facilities and Security Command
Center Replacement HVAC Contract Award

June 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with JCOR, Inc., for the replacement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
equipment at the Elati and Mariposa light rail facilities and the Security Command Center with a total
not-to-exceed amount of $3,510,598.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the agency’s standard asset management renewal process, staff identified HVAC equipment
located at the Elati and Mariposa light rail facilities and the Security Command Center as having reached
the end of its useful service life, thus requiring replacement. This equipment includes a boiler, a chiller,
three make-up air units (to ensure proper ventilation and maintain building pressure balance), data center
cooling, and packaged heating/air conditioning units.
Replacement equipment will meet currently applicable mechanical and energy codes.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value and Employee Ownership.
On February 7, 2025, RTD issued a solicitation for a contractor to complete the HVAC replacements
based on prepared plans and specifications. Bids were due on April 7, 2025, and two submittals were
received.
Should the Board approve this recommendation, the contractor will order equipment and mobilize for
construction when the equipment becomes available. The project is expected to be completed within 12
months following contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The HVAC equipment replacements will be funded from existing capital improvement dollars allocated in
the 2025 Budget.
