BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Platte Boiler Replacement
and Repair

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Finance, Audit, & Administration Committee that the Board of Directors
approve a budget transfer of $453,182 from the GM Contingency Fund to the Facilities budget to
fund the replacement of a boiler and 3 flues at Platte.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
The Platte shops has three boilers servicing the facility. They were replaced in 2014. Scope included
three new boilers and flues. Issues have risen with the boilers. RTD has filed a claim with our insurance
carrier for $278,182 for boiler #1.
We have a $100,000 deductible and have just received
$146,066.70. The insurance carrier is retaining $32,115.30 until the work on boiler #1 has been
completed. We are in the process of filing a claim with our insurance provider for boiler #2. We will be
pursing action against Legacy Mechanical, the installer, and Unilux Boiler, the manufacturer, to recover
our insurance deductible. We are currently evaluating the other boiler.
DISCUSSION
Shortly after installation it was determined that condensation from the three flues were becoming a
problem. Investigation took place to confirm that the new flues were deficient. RTD contacted the
manufacturer to inspect all three boilers. During inspection the manufacturer discovered that boiler #1
had a deformed housing or outer shell. The Risk Management Division was contacted to pursue claims
for the three flues and the damaged housing on boiler #1. An outsourced attorney and forensic
consultant have supplemented RTD’s investigation team. RTD has competitively contracted with
Rasmussen to replace boiler #1 and the three flues. Rasmussen was also contracted to tune up boiler #2
and boiler #3 as the firing was discovered to be excessive. Boiler #2 also failed while running on diesel
fuel. These boilers are designed as duel-fueled units. Boiler #2 also needs to be replaced which is why
additional funds for a second removal is required. A leaky valve is the suspected cause of the failure of
boiler #1 and boiler #2. We are only running on natural gas at this time. Funds being requested for
transfer will allow the project to move forward while the insurance claim is being processed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The GM contingency fund was set up to handle emergency situations such as this. This is an immediate
impact of $453,182. When the funds are received they will be returned to the GM contingency fund.

ALTERNATIVES
Recommended Action: It is recommended that the Finance, Audit, & Administration Committee
that the Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $453,182 from the GM Contingency
Fund to the Facilities budget to fund the replacement of a boiler and 3 flues at Platte.
Alternative #1: Don’t approve the request. This is not the recommended action as we would
have to wait for an extended period of time before funds would become available from insurance
and the boiler needs to be replaced/ repaired now.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Natalie Menten, Director, District M

Date:

February 5, 2020

Subject:

Check Register Publication

Date: February 5, 2020

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Menten, Mihalik, Lubow, Lewis, Williams, and Folska at the February 11,
2020 Financial Administration and Audit Committee, that the RTD Board of Directors instruct the Interim
General Manager/Chief Financial Officer to take all necessary steps to deploy the RTD Financial
Transparency Check Register at our website. This portal shall include a downloadable comma or text
delimited file which includes payee, date, check number or electronic funds transfer (EFT), invoice
number (if available), purchase order number (if available), cost center account code, object account
code, and description of purpose for the purchase. The data file shall contain only information that is a
public record or that is not confidential or otherwise protected from public disclosure pursuant to state or
federal law.
In addition, the chart of accounts shall be published listing cost center and object code, this file shall
also be available for download in comma or text delimited format.
The account payable check register shall be published and accessible to the public by July 1, 2020. The
downloadable file shall be updated monthly and contain the last three years of payments.
This recommended action supports the following Agency/General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #1 Strengthen transparent public communication
Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District Board of Directors at their March 2019 retreat endorsed a 2020
strategic goal to strengthen transparency and communication. Easier access to and storage of electronic
financial data should facilitate increased transparency in Regional Transportation District financial and
budget matters.
This policy directs staff to publish a downloadable comma or text delimited file on our public website
which shall include all public account payable line items including payee, date, check number or
electronic funds transfer (EFT), invoice number (if available), purchase order number (if available), cost
center account code, object account code, and description of the purpose. The data file shall contain
only information that is a public record or that is not confidential or otherwise protected from public
disclosure pursuant to state or federal law.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

In addition, the chart of accounts shall be published listing cost center and object code, this file shall
also be available for download in comma or text delimited format.
This account payable register shall be published and accessible to the public by July 1, 2020. The online
accounts payable file shall be updated monthly and contain the last three years of payments.
DISCUSSION
Currently, the Regional Transportation District publishes a monthly PDF check register which includes
date, payee, and amount. The monthly PDF format makes it difficult to compare month-to-month
expenditures and does not include description, cost center, or object code. Over the last decade, many
public agencies have expanded their financial transparency and provide a searchable and/or
downloadable accounts payable file. These examples include the State of Colorado, Jefferson County,
City and County of Denver, City of Boulder, Adams County, City of Northglenn, West Metro Fire, City of
Lakewood and City of Fort Collins are some examples. In an effort to create expanded transparency,
public agencies have invested various levels of public funds. In light of RTD's financial challenges, this
proposal requires minimal investment but greatly needed transparency in an agency that is facing
tremendous public scrutiny. The required data points including payee, date, amount, invoice number,
purchase order ID, cost center, object code, and description are currently available in Oracle. The most
simple and least expensive method is to offer a downloadable file which provides ability to search,
tabulate, and filter.
In November 2019, the Chief Financial Officer indicated the agency will be challenged to pay for
operations and maintenance on the current service. Enhanced financial transparency allows the public
better insight into the financial operations of the Regional Transportation District.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM9ZO-wPvFc&feature=youtu.be
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It will take approximately 64 hours at a cost of $5,610 to create the custom report. RTD’s IT team
needs to combine the Citibank Pcard activity from Citibank’s database and combine that with the AP
activity in Oracle and add the additional fields requested.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve recommendation to expand transparency in the Regional Transportation District.
2. Do not approve of expanded financial transparency and continue to publish monthly PDF without
useful detail.

Independent Accountants’ Report On Cost
Of General Manager’s Contract
Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
We have performed the procedures enumerated below, which were agreed to by the
Board of Directors (the Board) of the Regional Transportation District (the District),
solely for the purpose of determining the cost of the General Manager’s Contract
covering the period of January 1, 2016 through January 20, 2020. The Board is
responsible for the General Manager’s contract with the District. The sufficiency of
these procedures is solely the responsibility of the party specified in this report.
Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures
enumerated below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for
any other purpose.
The following procedures, and the results of applying those procedures, are as follows:
1. Review the executive employment agreement, effective January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2020 (the Contract), by and between the District and David
Genova, for employment services as the General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer of the District.
2. Review the amended executive employment agreement, effective January 1, 2019

Procedures performed to validate the amounts paid to the General Manager for 2019
included the following:
1. Salary and benefit costs were agreed to payroll records.
2. Benefit costs under this Contract are the same as those provided for all salaried
employees under the benefit plans.
The 2019 actual paid amounts were below the original estimate. This is primarily due
to smaller than estimated discretionary performance payment in 2019 for 2018 services.
The revised estimated annual amounts for 2020 were adjusted for the following:
1. The voluntary retirement of the General Manager effective January 20, 2020
2. The Amended Contract outlined a new base salary and related annual base
salary increase percentage of 1.5% for 2019 - 2025
3. Updated annual health insurance growth rate of 5.5%
4. Updated for Social Security and Medicare tax rates and thresholds for 2020

5. The District contributes to the RTD Salaried Pension Plan an amount based on
recommendations from the Plan actuary, which is then adjusted within budget
to available cash flow projections. The contribution in 2019 was $5,100,000. The
actuary does not calculate a contribution amount for each individual employee
but instead recommends an annual contribution based on the current funding of
the Plan and projections of future benefits to be paid for all participants using
certain actuarial assumptions. Therefore, the annual contribution consists of
amounts for active employees, inactive employees and retirees. For presentation
purposes, the contribution for the GM has been estimated at 9% of wages in the
absence of the availability of a per employee contribution. Future benefits paid
are adjusted to limits under IRS Section 401(a)(17) of $425,000.
6. The Amended Contract removed the potential discretionary performance
payment provision.
7. No awarded discretionary performance payment in 2020 for service in 2019.
8. An adjustment for an employee advance as a result of a payroll system
conversion in prior years
Original Estimate
Assumptions used in calculating the estimated cost of the Contract:
1. Mr. Genova’s continued employment with the District through the remainder of
the Contract period, including the automatic renewals for two additional one-year
terms through December 31, 2020
2. A discretionary performance payment of 10% of prior-year’s base salary is no
longer provided for after 2017.
3. Base salary shall receive an increase of $10,000 effective January 1 of each
successive year of the term or renewal term.
4. Vacation and sick time are included in the salary amounts and assumed to be
fully used, except for the annual sellback of 80 hours as allowed for salaried
employees of the District.
5. Enrollment in the District benefit plans remains unchanged, and annual cost
increased 5.8% for health insurance benefits and 2.3% for other benefits (we were
not engaged to, and we did not, perform any procedures on the reasonableness or
accuracy of this estimate).
6. Contribution percentage of 9% to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust

7. Reimbursement of legal fees of $4,000 in 2016
8. Section 401(a)(17) limits equal to the amount of $265,000 were used in the
estimates.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2019 attached. RTD funds are
invested in high quality, short term investments which are often affected by changing economic
conditions and expectations and also by actions of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the fourth
quarter of 2019 while business fixed investment and exports have weakened. The U.S. unemployment
rate decreased to 3.5% and general inflationary pressures have been muted.
In view of implications of global developments for the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to between 1.50 and
1.75 percent.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation mainly from timing of rail line openings. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted at beginning of year but now expected to start later.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of travel costs and costs for MinuteTraq. Final year-end accruals are not yet included.
(11) Variance due to recording 2018 interest for the P3 as prepaid until G Line was put in service in 2019 in which it was expensed

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Heather McKillop, Acting Interim General
Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

February 5, 2020

Subject:

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 5, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.6

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of February 3, 2020, 5,893 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 3,623 have been
approved, 1,550 have been denied and the remaining 720 are pending. Of the 1,550 denied, 1,062
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 353 were denied because their address was out of District, 14 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 12 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 7 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 102 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold. Of the 720 pending applications, 675 lack an uploaded photo, 33 are
pending for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for
LiVE, 1 is pending for income verification by Denver Human Services, and 11 applications are pending
because the applicant needs to provide additional information.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the

appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application worker helping interested individuals apply at rotating
locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. We have started
discussions with Denver Human Services about providing such a service.

On-Going:
