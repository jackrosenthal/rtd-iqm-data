Subject:

CRL Associates Final Option Year

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or her designee to enter into an agreement for Local
Government Liaison Services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the second one-year option
(January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021) to extend Contract No. 16-DO-025, at a cost of
$94,500. Funding for this contract is included in the 2021 budget.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5 –Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders reviewed the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel
recommended to the Communications and Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL
Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison. The firm serves as a liaison with the elected
officials and staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business
community and economic development organizations. This team has broad knowledge of RTD, its
history, programs and issues, as well as an extensive network of relationships with local government
entities, elected officials, and key stakeholders along the Front Range. The proposal was submitted for
the period of January 1,2017 through December 31,2019, with the potential for two (2) one-year
options. The Communications and Government Relations Committee has made annual recommendations
to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option
periods. This action relates to the second option year of this contract, which reflects a reduced rate. The
contractor willingly offered to reduce their contract amount by 10% given the agency’s financial
challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the final option year within the current contract, so
RTD would need to issue a Request for Proposal for Local Government Liaison Services beyond 2021.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the local elected
officials and staff in the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic
development organizations on matters related to RTD. This team has capably represented RTD’s local
government interests and matters with elected officials and key stakeholders in the Denver metro region
and has been an effective strategic partner in the agency’s local stakeholder coalition building.
As part of the Local Government Liaison Services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and
board members to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and county
levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular outreach to
the business community and economic development organizations in the metro area to develop
partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues. CRL will join RTD staff at local government meetings
and provide professional advice, counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as

they relate to RTD. CRL will also continue to provide liaison services in the implementation of the RTD
Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the second option year ($94,500) are included in the 2021 annual budget.

Lamar Transit Adjusted MAG for 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors revise the Minimum Annual Guarantee [MAG] to be received by RTD from Lamar Transit. Due
to impacts of COVID 19, the Committee recommends a net revised revenue guarantee of
$1,085,030.00 for 2021.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
Prior to the onset of COVID 19, RTD exercised a one-year extension for on-vehicle advertising services
with Lamar Transit, extending their period of performance to December 31, 2021. This period of
extension provides RTD with time to complete the preparation and selection of a vendor for the agency’s
enhanced approach to System Advertising. This approach will add digital customer information and
advertising opportunities to the existing on-vehicle advertising services. At the time of the notification,
all revenue parameters were unchanged. With the onset of COVID 19 and the extensive changes to
workplaces, travel and commuting, Lamar experienced significant cancellations and deferrals of
advertising contracts, and thereby, significant reductions in advertising revenue in 2020.
DISCUSSION
The Minimum Annual Guarantee [MAG] for 2020 was paid to RTD at the beginning of 2020 in the
amount of $3,400,000.00. Over the course of discussions with Lamar Transit, RTD and Lamar arrived
at applying the percentage of reduced service to a reduction of the MAG for 2021. RTD utilized a factor
of 60% of our pre-pandemic service level for the purpose of adjusting the revenue guarantee. The 2020
MAG credit and 2021 MAG reduction include two elements which account for the following:
(1) reduced service in 2020 and
(2) anticipated 60% service levels in 2021
The 2021 adjusted MAG of $1,085,030.00 was calculated in the following manner:
1) Credit for Reduced Service in 2020:
• MAG Revenue for 2020: $3,400,000 / 366 days = $9,289.62/day
• MAG Revenue per day @ 60%: $9,289.62/day x .6 = $5,573.78/day
•

Pandemic service plan began on April 19, 2020
o Jan. 1 – April 18 = 109 days @ 100 % service level
▪ 109 days x $9,289.62 per day = $1,012,568.58 (MAG at 100% Service
Level)

1.B.2

o

April 19 – Dec. 31 = 257 days

2) Revised MAG for 2021:
• $3,400,000 x 60% = $2,040,000 (adjusted MAG accounting for 60% service levels for
2021)
• $2,040,000 (adjusted 2021 MAG) - $954,970 (2020 credit) = $1,085,030.00
Adjusted MAG for 60% service level
2020 MAG Credit
REVISED 2021 MAG

$2,040,000 $954,970
$1,085,030.00

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed adjusted MAG for 2021 is $1,085,030.00, a $2,314,970.00 reduction in anticipated
revenue. The revenue sharing agreement between RTD and Lamar will continue, which is established as
a 60:40 revenue split once advertising sales exceed the baseline amount to trigger additional revenue
sharing. This adjusted revenue projection has been accounted for in the 2021 budget.

Presidential Election:
• Results are clear, if not yet finalized, and much of official Washington is recalibrating for the
incoming Biden Administration.
• Record-high popular votes tallies for both Biden and Trump: Red America became redder and
Blue America became bluer.
• What Congressional election results tell us:
• No coat tails: Biden’s popular vote and (expected) Electoral College wins did not translate into
down-ballot success for Congressional Democrats, so he lacks the large Democratic majorities that
could push through his most ambitious priorities.
• House: Democrats stunned by House losses, but will retain a narrow majority. Progressive wing’s
power may be diminished.
• Senate: Republicans’ Senate majority may also shrink (once Georgia elections concluded).
• Divided government does not necessarily mean gridlock and inaction, but it does mean:
• Fewer areas of common ground.
• Both parties already focused on the 2022 elections – growing their narrow majorities, flipping the
other chamber.
• Some basis for optimism:
• Biden is a pragmatist with a well-established history of making deals with Republicans, including
Senate Majority Leader McConnell.
• Infrastructure already identified as an area where policymakers can work together early in 2021.

• Senate:
• Bennet: term ends January 2023.
• Hickenlooper replaces Gardner.
• What Gardner’s loss to Hickenlooper could mean for RTD:

• Gardner is the only member of RTD’s delegation on a transportation authorizing
committee.
• If Republicans maintain their Senate majority, RTD no longer has a Senator in the
majority party.
• Impact of Gardner loss could be lessened if Democrats flip the Senate –
awaiting two Georgia Senate run-off races on January 5.
• Committee assignments for any member of the delegation could change in the next Congress,
and Hickenlooper’s assignments will not be made until January.

Final 78 days of Trump Presidency: Trump’s official schedule has been largely clear since the
November 3 election; he remains focused on contesting the popular vote and Electoral College vote
in key states.
• Electoral College process:
• December 14: Electors meet and cast votes in each State.
• January 6: Joint session of Congress tallies the Electoral College votes.
• If no candidate has at least 270 votes: House selects the President, via “one State, one
vote.” Republicans hold the majority of House seats in more States than Democrats do.
Senate selects the Vice President; each Senator gets one vote.
Lame duck session of 116th Congress:
• COVID relief: Months of high-level negotiations have failed to produce a bill.
• Speaker Pelosi’s all-or-nothing-approach requires a grand compromise.
•
•

•

Post-election, President Trump has disengaged; Senate Republicans now involved.
Democrats still seek to push through additional relief for transit, which Republicans view as
subsidies mainly for Democrat-led cities.
FY 2021 appropriations: Another year, another CR. The short-term Continuing Resolution (CR)
funding the Federal government ends on December 11, so Congress must pass another
spending bill by then to prevent a government shutdown.
• Potential legislative vehicle for our RRIF CRP fix.

• CR means transit apportionments are delayed. FTA has not released formula funds under
the current 10-week CR, awaiting passage of a longer term bill.
• By December 11: House and Senate appropriators aim to pass full-year legislation,
consolidating all 12 spending bills into a single omnibus bill.
• FY 2021 Transportation/HUD bills: Senate and House would increase transit formula
funding over FY 2020 level of $10.15 billion:
• Senate (introduced): $10.85 billion
• House (passed full House): $15.96 billion, in line with major increase in transit
programs under multi-year reauthorization bill passed by the House in July.
• House bill includes our RRIF Fix:
• Requires US DOT to refund CRPs upon repayment of individual loans – can no
longer hold CRPs until all loans in cohort are repaid.
• Appropriates $70 million to cover costs of returning all cohort 3 CRPs.
• For loans already repaid, like DUS loan, requires CRP refund within 60 days.
• FTA now supports our RRIF CRP fix, a welcome change from prior US DOT action.
• Difficult hurdles remain to passing an omnibus bill, including the same ones that
prevented timely passage of the spending bills in September, e.g., President Trump’s
request for funding for the southern border wall.

• One-year extension of the FAST Act expires September 30, 2021.
• Only path to reauthorization is a bipartisan one.
• House T&I Committee: Likely to return to its traditional bipartisan approach to advancing
surface transportation bills.
• Senate EPW Committee: Only Senate action to date – EPW reported out a bipartisan highway
bill in August 2019, with robust funding beyond what the HTF could support.
• Senate Banking Committee: when it finally acts, will produce a bipartisan transit title.
• No progress on a revenue solution: For the last 12 years, Highway Trust Fund (HTF) spending
has greatly exceeded gas tax revenues into the HTF, requiring repeated transfers from the
General Fund to meet program authorization levels. An additional $95 billion is needed over
the next 5 years just to maintain current program levels – no program growth.
• Not the year for a revenue increase? The alternative – deficit spending – is not much better.
• No political will, particularly among Republicans, to raise the gas tax, as economic
impacts of COVID continue.
• Yet Republicans are reluctant to continue the unprecedented levels of deficit
spending of 2020.
• Earmarks would help build support among Members of Congress for a revenue increase.
• House Democratic leaders are considering restoring appropriations earmarks.
• Don’t expect Senate Republicans to agree.

Biden’s transition plans include ambitious tenets on infrastructure but with few details. His proposals are
not tied to any legislative text and there is no specific timetable for advancement.
• Supporting union jobs and mitigating climate change are the prisms through which Biden views
transportation investments.
• Transit: A-chicken-in-every-pot approach:
“Provide every American city with 100,000 or more residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public
transportation options through flexible federal investments with strong labor protections that create good,
union jobs and meet the needs of these cities — ranging from light rail networks to improving existing transit
and bus lines to installing infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.”
• Rail: True to his nickname of Amtrak Joe, Biden plans to “spark the second great railroad revolution” – and
fix the RRIF loan program.
• Lamenting that US rail systems lag behind those of Europe and Asia, Biden wants to ensure:
“America has the cleanest, safest, and fastest rail system in the world — for both passengers and freight. His
rail revolution will reduce pollution, connect workers to good union jobs, slash commute times, and spur
investment in communities that will now be better linked to major metropolitan areas. To speed that work,
Biden will tap existing federal grant and loan programs at the U.S. Department of Transportation, and improve
and streamline the loan process. In addition, Biden will work with Amtrak and private freight rail companies
to further electrify the rail system, reducing diesel fuel emissions.”
• Biden takes a decidedly more positive view of the Gateway project (NY/NJ) and California HSR than
Trump’s DOT did, and calls for a truly nationwide passenger rail system – not just on the coasts:
“Across the Midwest and the Great West, he will begin the construction of an end-to-end high-speed rail
system that will connect the coasts, unlocking new, affordable access for every American.”

• Past four years: All talk and no action. Congressional Democrats and Trump Administration

repeatedly spoke of working together on $1 trillion infrastructure legislation, but Senate
Republicans looked to Trump to lead on a revenue source before they would get on board.
• Under the banner of “Build Back Better,” Biden’s surrogates talk of moving an infrastructurecentric stimulus bill much like Obama’s 2009 Recovery Act early in 2021.
• Support for “shovel ready” and “shovel worthy” projects.
• Biden’s proposal to pay for the bill by repealing Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts will not
pass the Senate.
• With Republicans keeping their Senate majority, Democrats’ infrastructure bill from
this summer, with its generous funding for transit and climate change measures, will
not advance in 2021, as House T&I Chairman DeFazio and Speaker Pelosi had hoped.
• Unclear if the reauthorization of transit and highway programs would travel on this broad
infrastructure stimulus bill:
• Neither chamber may be ready: if House must start over and produce a bipartisan
reauthorization bill and Senate has yet to advance a transit or rail title.
• Deadline is several months away: current FAST Act extension runs through September
30, 2021, so not a pressing priority.

December Board Report

On November 17th Governor Polis announced the call for a special session which will begin on
November 30th to address some of the financial challenges Coloradans are facing as a result of
the pandemic. The special session would provide targeted, immediate assistance to the most
impacted and vulnerable communities across Colorado and includes the following:
•

Small Business Relief and Assistance ($105 million) Sales tax retention for bars and
restaurants ($50 million), direct emergency assistance for small businesses ($55 million).

•

Housing and Rental Assistance ($50 million) The $50 million would likely be a
combination of the programs, with the most funds directed to two programs with the
highest demonstrated need: Property Owner Preservation Program and the Emergency
Housing Assistance Program.

•

Child Care Support ($50 million) Sustainability grants to support existing centers with
increasing costs ($40 million) Childcare start up and/or expansion grants to create up to
300 additional providers ($10 million).

•

Expanding Broadband Access for Students ($20 million) Funding for CDE to support elearning for students: resources to school districts and charter schools to reimburse for
off-campus internet access for students and educators, which may include purchasing
hotspots and data plans, or paying for low-cost internet for students whose families may
not be able to afford high speed broadband.

BBMK will continue to provide updates to the Board and RTD senior staff as the additional
details related to the special session are finalized. BBMK anticipates knowing both house and
senate committee assignments by the first week of December, but do not anticipate any changes
with respect to transportation committee leadership.
BBMK coordinated a call with transportation chairs Senator Faith Winter and Rep. Matt Gray
along with Directors Guissinger and Whitmore to discuss the RTD Accountability Committee
and potential 2021 legislation regarding increases for transportation funding solutions.
BBMK scheduled priority calls with Governor Polis and CDOT ED, Shoshana Lew along with
the chairs of the House and Senate Transportation committees, Senator Winter and Rep. Gray.
We are also in process of confirming dates for GM Johnson to meet virtually with Senate
Majority Leader Fenberg and Speaker of the House Alec Garnett.
The Office of the State Auditor will release a performance audit to the Legislative Audit
Committee in January 2021. BBMK will have additional details on the exact date in January
when the Committee meets in December.

Governor Polis released his fiscal year 2021-22 budget request on November 2, 2020. This
budget request totals $35.4 billion in total funds, including $13.6 billion in General Fund
expenditures. The $13.6 billion includes $12.5 billion within agency budgets and $363 million
set aside for placeholders and budget adjustments. This budget request also projects an ending
General Fund balance of $1.267 billion or 10% reserve level.
As highlighted in his press conference, the Governor’s budget includes restoring major
reductions made in the 2020-21 budget, economic stimulus, and future savings. Utilizing the
higher than expected revenue as forecast in the September revenue forecast and other FY 202021 budget savings, the Governor has restored areas substantially cut in the 2020-21 budget such
as higher education ($494 million increase), K-12 ($577 million increase), and the PERA direct
distribution ($225). Along with these restorations, the budget request includes flat provider rates
and flat state employee salaries. In terms of economic stimulus, the budget also includes $1.28
million. The break down of these funds can be found in the table below.

More information on the $130 million requested in the stimulus package for “shovel ready
projects” can be found here.
With 11 ballot initiatives and a hopeful federal stimulus package outstanding, this budget request
signals a starting point for the FY 2021-22 budget and budget season. The Joint Budget
Committee will begin detailed discussions on this budget request and other outstanding budget
issues November 11th.

• Agenda
On October 19, 2020, the RTD Accountability Committee met. During the meeting, committee
members received presentations from the contract consultant North Highland about their
expertise and scope of work and from the subcommittees. The committee also reviewed a focus
document prepared by Co-Chairs Elise Jones and Crystal Murillo which breaks down the broad
goals established by the subcommittees into action areas. The document can be found in the
agenda for the meeting linked here. While considering the focus document, Elise Jones
highlighted these action areas, based on discussions from the subcommittees thus far, are ordered
from most to least important. The committee stressed that recommendations from the
Accountability Committee should be based on the root challenges faced by RTD such as a need
for flexibility to better serve the whole region and that recommendation which require state
legislative action be sent to the legislature before the end of the 2021 State Legislative Session.
RTD’s new General Manager will be invited to give feedback on the highlighted action areas
during the December Accountability Committee meeting. Moving forward, Julie Duran Mullica
will be the chair of the governance subcommittee, Deyanira Zavala will be the chair of the
operations subcommittee, and Rutt Bridges will be the chair of the finance subcommittee.

The central element to both models is integration of local perspectives. While some committee
members were worried about creating an extra layer of bureaucracy for RTD service and capital
decisions, the majority of the committee agreed looking into the LA Metro subregional model
would be a beneficial path forward. The committee discussed using this model instead of
pursuing an appointed board due to the structural changes this would bring to RTD. The
governance subcommittee was given the direction to pursue how this model would function (ie.
how would this model change RTD’s budget structure, how would this influence service
planning, what would be the unintended consequence of moving to a subregional model). The
subcommittee will begin with a presentation from DRCOG on its regional and subregional
model.

• Agenda
On October 7, 2020, the finance subcommittee of the RTD accountability committee met and
received a presentation from Rutt Bridges regarding his ideas to utilize RTD staff and
infrastructure to bolster immunization infrastructure in Colorado. Bridges argument was, due to
COVID-19, RTD ridership will be slow to recover therefore affecting the district’s finances and
utilization of RTD’s existing infrastructure. His solution to this issue includes RTD working with
public health partners to develop immunization infrastructure for a COVID-19 vaccine. Through
this work, RTD could transition employees that would otherwise be let go to help with this new
effort. Proposed funding for this program would come from federal, state, and local governments
specific to vaccine infrastructure in preparation for a COVID-19 vaccine. RTD board members
and staff on the subcommittee call responded positively to this idea. The subcommittee will meet
again on October 21st to discuss RTD’s peer agencies and state statutes governing RTD.

On November 4, 2020, the finance subcommittee of the RTD accountability committee met to
receive presentations from CDOT on its financial dashboard, Natalie Shishido on the peer
agency comparisons being investigated, a summary of the FasTracks unfinished corridors report,
and to discuss potential statutes for legislative change during the 2021 State legislative session.
The committee discussed changes to CRS. 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios, CRS 32-9119.8 Provision of Retail and Commercial Goods and Services at District Transfer Facilities,
CRS 32-9-119.9 Limited Authority to Charge Fees for Parking, and the statute which limits RTD
to 58% of service being contracted. Lynn Guissinger highlighted that RTD staff is preparing a
list of state statutes they would like to see addressed and agreed that changes to these statutes
would give needed flexibility to the District. Co-Chair Elise Jones will further discuss this topic
with the larger accountability committee during their next scheduled meeting so
recommendations can be made to the State legislature in time for the 2021 legislative session.
Governance Subcommittee:
September 28, 2020 RTD AC Governance Subcommittee Meeting 2
• https://drcog.org/node/978041
• Agenda
The RTD Accountability Committee governance subcommittee met September 28, 2020 to learn
about the transit planning landscape in the Denver metro area as well as how the Denver
landscape compares to those around the United States. The comparison regions included
Portland, Phoenix, Detroit, Utah, Dallas, and San Diego. This information can be found in the
agenda document linked here. Members of the subcommittee expressed interest in the San Diego
and Detroit models because of the required level of interaction with local governments. Both
models have appointed boards where appointees are chosen by regional and local governments.
Committee member Jackie Millet highlighted the appointed board in these models may be better
because of their accountability to overall regional development instead of only an accountability
to their constituents. The subcommittee will continue to look at regional transportation
landscapes around the country to gain a better understanding of possible governance structures
for RTD.

2000 Regional Directors Map

On October 5, 2020, the Governance Subcommittee of the RTD Accountability Committee met
to discuss the development of the RTD district map and explore the change from a 20-member
appointed board to a 15 member elected board in 1980. During a presentation from Bill Van
Meter at RTD, the committee discussed the process by which district boundaries are decided and
RTD boundaries are established. Elise Jones highlighted the need for flexible solutions to
cohesively connect transportation services that exist outside and within the RTD boundaries.
Other committee members expressed the desire for a smaller RTD board with representation
from less urban areas within the District. The committee continues to review other transportation
organizations’ governance structures including the LA Metro organization.

Chair Julie Duran Mullica, during discussion surrounding these focus areas, challenged the
committee to think of ways RTD can be a better partner and regain the trust of stakeholders and
riders. She also asked the committee to brainstorm non-financial ways to aid RTD to achieve
these goals considering RTD’s current financial struggles. The subcommittee decided, as they
review governance structures, to pull out items that can solve the distrust between RTD and its
stakeholders such as opportunities for community-based decision making. The next governance

November 2, 2020 RTD AC Governance Subcommittee Meeting 5
• https://drcog.org/node/978048
• Agenda
On November 2, 2020, the governance subcommittee of the RTD accountability committee met
to receive a presentation from the LA Metro transit organization. During this presentation, Conan
Cheung, the service organizer for LA Metro, and Dolores Ramos, the service council director,
discussed the governance and operational structure of LA Metro. Since 2003, LA Metro has
utilized subregional councils to determine service and community outreach. In 2011, this model
changed to centralize operational changes in the LA Metro Board while the service councils still
maintained control over community outreach and service coordination throughout a particular
region. Service councils consist of a 9-member appointed board with regional oversight.
Decisions are made on a service route by the LA Metro board at the direction of the service
council which has most of the route in their jurisdiction. Through questioning, committee
members also learned LA Metro has a designated formula in State statute which allocates
funding for projects and services, leaving the LA Metro board with little discretionary funds.
Committee members also asked questions around how services for environmental and social
justice were decided, what the public outreach process looked like, and what interactions look
like with unions through the LA Metro subregional system. The answer to all three, decisions are
mostly made at the subregional level and then brought to the LA Metro Board for final approval.
Many members of the committee expressed interest in further pursuing this structure for a future
RTD model because of the level of collaboration between local community stakeholders and
other local transit systems.

https://drcog.org/node/978049
Agenda

On November 16, 2020, the governance subcommittee of the RTD accountability committee met
to discuss how to implement a subregional model of governance. First, the committee received a
presentation from DRCOG regarding the DRCOG transportation improvement process (TIP)
model which includes regional and subregional input on DRCOG project funding. Ron Papsdorf
from DRCOG highlighted the extra technical support used by the regional policy groups to make
decisions about DRCOG capital funds under DRCOG Board parameters. He also stated, though
the regional approach created significant buy in from local communities, the parameters
established to distribute capital funds for projects are not completely transferable to an RTD
regional model. The subcommittee’s preliminary discussions outline a RTD regional/subregional
model to include subregional policy groups composed of transit advocates and local elected
officials, supported by technical staff, with some level of decision power over service and
resource allocation. Subcommittee members agree there is significant work still needed to fully
outline this plan. Under the direction of Chair Julie Mullica, the subcommittee will continue to
gather information on what the best subregions will be, how resources will be allocated, and

On October 8, 2020, the operations subcommittee of the RTD accountability committee met to
discuss equity in transit service planning. Following the presentation from RTD service planning
staff last meeting, the committee highlighted that regarding vulnerable populations, RTD focuses
mostly on limiting further harm but does not specifically think about advancing equity.
Committee members discussed the dueling interests of increased coverage and ridership.
Feedback from Krystin Trustman, the accountability committee member appointed to represent
the disability community, emphasized RTD has done a good job not cutting services for accessa-ride and ensuring equity for access-a-ride riders. As the committee moves forward, they will be
pursuing recommendations regarding fare zone structures and sub regional models of services.

The committee did not go through the list of priorities in detail however some members provided specific
feedback on issues listed below.
• The space on fixed route buses for ADA is the “bare minimum” and does not allow for tie downs
or parallel parking of wheelchairs.
• RTD could be doing better to serve the transit reliant population by using innovative methods.
These solutions do not always mean a full bus route.
• RTD could consider pilot projects during COVID-19 to identify opportunities for changes to
routes or additional services in particular areas.

Monika Treipl-Harnke, RTD Senior Manager of Revenue, provided a presentation on the LiVE
program and its history. The committee request additional information about the RTD pass
working group discussions and considerations.
Matthey Helfant from DRCOG provided a presentation on fare equity which highlighted the
Portland Tri-Met and Kansas City transit systems. Portland Tri-met provides approximately $8.5
million in free or reduced fares with a 50-72% fare discount based on duration of the pass. The
program is paid for with revenue from a state payroll tax equal to one-tenth of 1%. Kansas City
Zero Fare Transit is free and costs $4.8 million in state revenue. The cost for RTD to implement
free fares would have eliminated over $150 million in 2019 revenue if all fares were removed.
Committee member Jackie Millet commented that it would be unrealistic to try these models for
a large district like RTD. Other committee members suggested that RTD owns a significant
portion of land and leasing this land would yield $150 million.

Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

General

Board Meeting Date: December 1, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from
December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, with no change to the contract not-to-exceed amount.
Funding for this contract is included in the 2021 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in
the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the following General Manager’s goals:
Mission-oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
2021 Strategic Priority #4: Increase Ridership, Improve Rider Experience
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that brought the Contract Not-toExceed price up to $191,423,336.
In May 2017, the Board extended the contract completion date to December 31, 2019 without
increasing the contract price. At that time, the contract was amended to cover specific named
individuals and functional areas, with projected timeframes of availability for each one. In December
2018, the Board extended the contract completion date to December 31, 2020, and increased the
contract not-to-exceed amount to its current value of $192,623,336. This contract amendment would
not increase the contract value beyond the current authorized amount. Due to the hand-over of the NLine in September of this year, the additional work on the SERE project and final as-builds from the Eagle
and I-225, the survey and property effort had to be postponed until the completion of these activities. At
this time Jacob’s surveying and property team is completing needed record documents, survey and final
property transfer documents for the projects outlined below.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s
specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering, construction management support,
program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often part-time, basis.

2.B.1

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract originally was specified for a term of six years with a six-year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. In December 2018, the contract
end date was extended to the current end date of December 31, 2020.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where all the ongoing corridor projects have
reached revenue service and are in the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to finalize the
transactions and mapping that will secure the right-of-way for the program alignments, including survey
and mapping support for final acquisitions and utility relocations, post-construction surveys, and filing of
right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension to the Jacobs contract would make the resources
available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and cost-effective manner.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual was to leave Jacobs before
the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining hours for
that individual.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
• Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW), and
utility survey for all corridors and facilities.
North Metro
• Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
I-225
• Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Southeast Rail Extension
• Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
• Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The DBE report through September 2020
indicates that the PSC’s actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 18.94%. RTD does not foresee
any additional opportunities for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the
named roles are filled by Jacobs employees. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed
amount, the DBE participation on the overall contract would be approximately 18.6%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2021, would remain
at the currently authorized amount of $192,623,336 with this amendment. Funding for the remainder
of this contract is included in the 2021 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific
projects where PSC support would be utilized.

Big Takeaway: Model Projects
a Notable Demand for Rail
After months of data-intensive work and many simulated runs, we found:
• There would be notable demand for rail service all along the Front Range.
• Demand is highest for commuters, but there’s also substantial demand for
recreation and special events.
• Front Range Passenger Rail ridership projections fare well when compared to
other successful intercity rail lines across the country.
• There would be real reductions in emissions and vehicle miles traveled.

Proposed Grant Program

2
Amtrak is proposing creation of a Network
Modernization Program (NMP) as part of our
reauthorization to support rail network
evolution and expansion, including efforts to
plan, develop, construct, and operate intercity
passenger rail service in high- potential shortdistance corridors like the Front Range.
As envisioned, the program would make
federal grant funds available to Amtrak to
cover up to 100% of the capital costs and
initial operating costs of new corridor service;
states would then gradually assume a greater
share of operating costs over a five-year
transition period. After this five-year period, if
the states want to continue service, long-term
costs would be allocated in accordance with
the existing Passenger Rail Investment and
Improvement Act (PRIIA) Sec. 209
methodology as currently used by many
states throughout the nation.
Existing Grants Continue
Amtrak intends for the NMP to supplement
existing grant opportunities (e.g., BUILD,
SOGR, CRISI, INFRA, & REG), and not to
replace them.

Unfinished

Information

This document provides a 2020 update to the “FasTracks Initial Unfinished Corridors Report” dated June
14, 2019, with a specific focus on: the current status of the FasTracks Financial Forecast; and a
Northwest Rail Peak Service BNSF / RTD Coordination Summary. The status of the remaining unfinished
FasTracks corridors remains substantially the same as reported in the referenced Report from 2019.
FasTracks Financial Forecast Update
In the June 14, 2019 “FasTracks Initial Unfinished Corridors Report”, RTD delineated ten different
funding scenarios as identified below. These 10 scenarios were developed based on the March 2019,
CU Leeds School of Business sales and use tax forecast. Since March 2019, RTD’s financial condition
has changed significantly. In March of 2020, RTD’s sales and use tax and fare box revenues decreased
significantly due to the impacts of COVID-19. The revenue forecast for September 2020 was much
better but was still down about 5% to 6%.
Due to the volatility of the revenues, the RTD Board of Directors has decided not to adopt a six-year plan
or long-range plan in 2020. As a result, we were not able to update the 10 scenarios based on the
current revenue forecasts. However, we did look at the current revenue forecast for 2021-2026 and
compared it to the last Mid-Term Financial plan adopted in 2019. It appears that the current revenue
forecast is at least $700 million less in 2021-2026 than the forecast used for the report last year. This
lower forecast may make many of the scenarios difficult to realize. RTD intends to update the six-year
and long-range financial forecasts in 2021.

Northwest Rail Peak Service BNSF / RTD Coordination Summary
BNSF / Stakeholder Meeting
On February 21, 2020, RTD Directors Lubow and Catlin, RTD staff and representatives from local
jurisdictions on the Northwest (NW) Rail alignment met with the BNSF at their Fort Worth headquarters
to discuss the potential for establishing peak-period passenger rail service in the Corridor. The proposed
service would provide three one-way train trips during the morning rush hour traveling from Longmont to
Union Station in Denver. During the afternoon rush hour, the service would provide three one-way trips
from Union Station back to Longmont. Representatives from the following local jurisdictions attended
the meeting:
•
•
•

Boulder County
City of Longmont
City of Westminster

At the meeting BNSF staff provided a presentation in response to questions previously posed by the
coalition. The presentation included information on the following items:
•
•
•
•

The assumptions used by BNSF to model the peak service proposal.
The capital improvements required to improve corridor travel time.
Positive Train Control (PTC) and Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) systems requirements
Potential siding (passing track) locations.

Other items noted by BNSF staff:

BNSF staff emphasized that their Commuter Principles state that, “No commuter rail operation can degrade
BNSF’s Freight service”. Accordingly, the modeling exercise had to mitigate the impacts of the three trains
passenger trains in the morning and three trains in the evening operating along the BNSF system (Westminster
Station to Longmont).
RTD would be responsible for constructing stations items such as boarding platforms and pedestrian crossings.
The corridor is an element of the BNSF core network; they have no intention of selling the corridor.
Their model indicates that the planned passenger service can work with their freight operations in the corridor –
provided the necessary infrastructure upgrades are implemented.

BNSF did not provide a cost estimate for capital or operations. In order to generate cost estimates,
BNSF staff would need to complete 30 percent engineering plans. BNSF agreed that the next steps
would be to provide RTD with a letter outlining the assumptions that have been used to date for their
modeling analysis.
BNSF Response Letter
BNSF provided RTD with a response letter dated May 15, 2020. The letter documented the modeling
assumptions discussed at the on February 21, 2020. Following is a summary of the key information
discussed in the letter.
Operational Assumptions
• Freight traffic numbers were determined by using 12 months of data culminating in January 2019.
• RTD passenger trains times should not exceed 67 minutes to travel the full length of the corridor from Longmont to
Union Station (52 minutes between Longmont and the existing Westminster Station).
• PTC and CTC would be installed to enhance safety for passenger train movements.
• BNSF infrastructure improvements would be required to meet RTD run time goals as well as fully mitigate the delay
impact to freight trains caused by the passenger trains.
Specific RTD Infrastructure Assumptions:
Stations would be constructed by RTD at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
•

88th Avenue, Westminster
116th Avenue, Broomfield
Flatiron, Broomfield
Downtown Louisville
Boulder Junction
Downtown Longmont

BNSF Infrastructure Assumptions:
•
•
•

Tracks would be upgraded to allow for higher speed limits.
Existing sidings at Boulder and Broomfield would be upgraded to allow for freight train movements.
Addition of four new sidings ranging from approximately 6,500 to 9,000 feet in length at the following locations
would be constructed:
o Westminster – 92nd Avenue to 105th Avenue
o Louisville – Pine Street to Baseline Road
o Boulder – North of Arapahoe Avenue, 62nd Street to 48th Street
o Boulder, Gunbarrel – 55th Street to 63rd Street.

Overall summary:
•
•

The infrastructure improvements described above would allow RTD trains to complete runtimes of approximately 61
to 63 minutes for the full corridor from Union Station to Longmont.
The infrastructure improvements would mitigate delays to BNSF freight trains caused by RTD passenger trains for
approximately ten years (assuming a 2 percent annual growth rate in freight traffic).

Next Steps
If BNSF is to move forward with preparing a cost-estimate for the corridor, RTD would have to enter into
a design agreement with BNSF whereby RTD would fund the cost of preparing the design documents.
BNSF has not yet determined what the full cost for that effort would be.
2020 Updated Northwest Rail Ridership Forecasts
In August 2020, RTD staff prepared an update to the NW Rail Corridor ridership forecasts. Based on
continued stakeholder interest in exploring the possibility of grant funding support through the Federal
Transit Administration’s Section 5309 Capital Investment Grant (New Starts) program, RTD staff tested
a potential enhancement to the corridor’s competitiveness for New Starts funding by increasing the rail
project’s capture of ridership in the general travel market.
This test was run using DRCOG’s modeling platform and land use projections for the “Opening” (current
year) and 2040 “Horizon” years. Note that DRCOG’s model includes all of the RTD District and includes
projections for southwest Weld county. So, while it includes the vast majority of the potential travel
market for the NW Rail Corridor, trips coming from outside the DRCOG modeling area (such as Loveland,
Ft. Collins, Greeley) are not captured in the transit demand forecasts. To prepare the forecasts, RTD
staff assumed the following:
•
•
•

55 one-way rail trips per weekday as follows:
o every half-hour from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and between 3:30 PM and 6:30 PM
o hourly service during remaining hours, with a service span between 4:00 AM and midnight;
Termination of all Flatiron Flyer routes; and
Re-routing of all Flatiron Flyer local bus service connections to instead connect to the NW Rail stations.

The results are show below, labeled “Without FF.” We have also shown the previous model runs for
comparison purposes:

This test is based on the abandonment of Flatiron Flyer services, making NW Rail service the primary
transit option within the Corridor. The resulting ridership forecasts are higher in this test scenario
compared with ridership forecasts for the NW Rail Corridor when operating in concert with existing
Flatiron Flyer services. Note, however, that the breakpoint for a New Starts Medium Cost Effectiveness
rating is $9.99 or better (i.e. lower than $9.99). At $26.62, the project still would not meet minimum
project justification criteria for FTA funding in the competitive New Starts grant program.
