#### 1. Local Government Liaison Services

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the fourth option year (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496.  Funding for this contract is included in the annual FasTracks budget.

Motion:                Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Roger Sherman from CRL Associates noted that Committee Chair Folska and Director Francone requested he sent to the Directors a summary of CRL Associates’ work on behalf of RTD.  A copy of the document is available at the Board Office.  He acknowledged that Maria Garcia Berry, Chief Executive Officer for CRL Associates, was in attendance at the meeting as well.

Committee Chair Folska declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, thanked the Directors for the vote of confidence in moving to the full Board unanimously the renewal of the local government liaison services contract.

He noted that the municipal elections results would start to be tallied that evening.  He added that he would be happy to make any contacts with newly elected officials, set up meetings, write congratulatory letters, and any other outreach the Directors may want.

Roger Sherman pointed out that the Metro Area County Commissioners (MACC) meeting was held on Friday, October 30th.  The agenda included a discussion on transportation value capture and tax increment financing for transportation. Unfortunately this item was eclipsed by a discussion on hospital fees, pushing the transportation discussion until January, 2016.

He added that CRL Associates has been working with the Citizen’s Advisory Committee.  The committee will present to the Directors a draft recommendation on the direction they would like to see the committee take as the FasTracks projects wind down.  Roger Sherman does not anticipate any red flags on their proposal.

#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna, noted that during the last Transportation Legislative Review Committee (TLRC) meeting Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, and Lacy Bell, Manger for Planning Projects, presented an update on the fares.  Director Francone was in attendance.  She pointed out that the TLRC is composed by many of metro area mayors who were very interested in the presentation.  Jenifer Brandeberry said that the TLRC presented 5 bills, none of which have any direct impact on RTD.

She informed the Directors that Governor Hickenlooper will present his budget to the Joint Budget Committee (JBC) next week.  Jenifer Brandeberry noted that it is a weird time in Colorado because the revenue is doing well yet there are some constitutional restraints as to how funds are used.  These restraints guarantee that a lot of energy from the Congressional session will be spent on the budget.  She added that the exact outcome of the budget will be known in March, 2016.

Brandeberry~McKenna participated in the Colorado Department of Transportation’s (CDOT) stakeholder process regarding potential bus on shoulder legislation.  The firm will bring a draft to the Board when it is available and will assist in getting the legislation passed as it plays an important role for the US36 project.

Jennifer Brandeberry thanked the staff and Board who were present during the Legislative Audit Committee performance audit of RTD’s Bus and Light Rail Train Operator Safety Practices.

##### a. State Update for 11-3-15

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs noted that the House of Representatives had chosen a new Speaker.

He added that the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up its multi-year reauthorization legislation on October 22nd.  The House voted to extend the surface transportation programs for 3 weeks until November 20th.  The extension included a 3 year delay in the deadline for Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation.  Mike Dino noted that the House pushed 29 amendments on the transportation authorization bill in order to send it to the Senate by Thursday, November 5th, and have something before the President by Thanksgiving.  This meant pushing the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) amendment until later.  Mike Dino pointed out that the BRT amendment may not happen as it is not lining up politically.  He noted that Squire Patton Boggs will keep the Board updated on any changes.

Committee Chair Folska asked how RTD was looking in order to receive the $92 million Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA).  Mike Dino replied that RTD seems to be in a good place.  He noted that both Congressman Shuster and Congressman Defazio do not intend to undermine Transit, New Starts, or Small Starts.

Director Lubow asked if there has been any movement redefining BRT.  Mike Dino replied that not at this time.

Committee Chair Folska reminded the Directors that Squire Patton Boggs will present their annual report during the December 1st Government Relations Committee meeting.
