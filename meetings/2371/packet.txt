BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

CEO

Date: October 28, 2015

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 27, 2015

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison
services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the fourth option year (January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496. Funding for this
contract is included in the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the fourth and final option period from January 1,
2016 to December 31, 2016. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison
services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the fourth option year ($122,496) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to exercise the fourth option
year (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a
cost of $122,496.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
enter into an agreement to exercise the fourth option year on the contract for the Local
Government Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested
parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with
local government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and
policies.

1.C.3.a

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: NOVEMBER 3, 2015
(current as of October 26)


The House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee marked up (i.e., debated and
offered amendments to) its multi-year reauthorization legislation on October 22. The bill
provides $55 billion for public transportation programs, with very modest annual growth
(less than 2 percent) in program authorization levels.
o The bill makes few significant changes in public transportation programs, but does
restore a discretionary grant program for bus and bus facility projects and makes
further strides in streamlining environmental and other project approval processes.



Facing the October 29 expiration of surface transportation programs, the House will likely
vote on Tuesday, October 27, on a bill to extend these programs for three weeks, through
November 20, and send this bill to the Senate, where it may meet some opposition.



The extension includes a three-year delay in the deadline for railroads to implement Positive
Train Control (PTC). Senator Barbara Boxer opposes de-coupling the “must-pass” PTC
deadline relief for railroads from the House and Senate long-term transportation bills,
believing the PTC extension is needed to ensure passage of the larger legislation this fall.
Next Steps for the House’s Long-term Bill:


While the T&I Committee approved its six-year reauthorization bill with just seven days to
go until the expiration of the current three-month extension of transportation programs, the
timing of further action on this legislation is uncertain, in part because the bill still lacks a
revenue title to help pay for the programs.



The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to release a revenue title soon that looks
very similar to the Senate DRIVE Act’s, adopted in July. The Senate bill supplements
Highway Trust Fund revenues for three years through a General Fund transfer offset by
spending cuts and revenue increases from sources throughout the Federal budget, with the
remaining three years authorized pending additional revenue. The House bill reported out of
the T&I Committee already includes a similar 3 + 3 year authorization scheme, but lacks
sufficient revenues to fully pay for even the first three years of program authorizations.
Crowded Congressional Calendar:


The House and Senate face a particularly busy schedule, with the election of a new House
Speaker planned for October 29 and efforts to increase the debt limit before November 3.



The budget agreement just reached by Congress and the President will allow for increased
spending for defense and nondefense programs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and will lift
the debt limit until March 2017. We expect a vote on this budget deal before October 30.



The agreement would offset a portion of the spending increases through selling some of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This same pay-for was also included in the Senate DRIVE Act
to help fund the first three years of transit and highway programs under that bill. A dollar
can only be spent once, so revenues included as pay-fors in any bill enacted before the surface
transportation bill is passed are no longer available as offsets to pay for transit and highway
program spending.
