#### 1. RTD Bus Passenger Shelters

Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, introduced Tom Papadinoff, Team Lead/Landscape Architect-Urban Design, Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, and Bill Bottini, Public Facilities Maintenance Manager, who reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the August 5, 2014 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.

Michael Washington explained that per current RTD guidelines, a stop needs 40 boardings per day averaged over a month to qualify for a shelter to be installed by RTD.  He said that staff is in the process of developing additional guidelines in conjunction with the boardings to help better prioritize shelter installations as right now many of RTD’s stops meet the requirement.

Tom Papadinoff noted that most of the RTD owned shelter locations are along heavily trafficked bus routes.  He shared that staff will begin a study in 2015 to help identify shelter concepts that will better fit RTD’s needs; the goal of the study is to come back to the Board with ideas in Spring, 2015.

Director Tobiassen commented that there are also many third party shelters throughout the District.  He wondered how it was determined where these shelters are installed and who is responsible for their maintenance.  Director Tobiassen also inquired why some shelters have schedules posted while others do not.  Henry Stopplecamp shared that the third party shelters are installed by advertising companies in conjunction with the municipalities.  These shelters are installed in highly visible areas, not based on the number of RTD passengers that use the bus stop.  He said that the advertising company is responsible for the maintenance of their shelters.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that schedules are only put in RTD shelters that are large enough to accommodate them as the third party shelters are much smaller and completely covered by advertisements.

Director Tobiassen asked for further information on the Shelter Watch program referenced in the presentation.  He hopes this is something he can help foster in his District to get more community involvement.  Henry Stopplecamp said that staff would provide Director Tobiassen with further details.

Director Folska inquired if the RTD shelters are prefabricated and their cost.  Henry Stopplecamp said that RTD currently installs prefabricated Tolar shelters.  The cost per shelter is between $11 and $15 thousand.  He shared that all of the RTD shelters started out having glass.  As the glass is damaged RTD will replace it once; should it be damaged again RTD will install metal mesh.  Henry Stopplecamp said that staff would paint the mesh several times if needed, but if damage continues eventually the walls are removed, leaving just the roof.

Director Folska wondered how the shelters met ADA requirements.  She asked if the shelters were wheelchair accessible.  She also wondered if the schedules and public information provided available in in a manner for people without sight.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that there is a wide opening that could accommodate wheelchairs.  Scott Reed said that not all the information was presented with braille.  He explained that there are some basic directions, including the telephone number for the Telephone Information Center, at every RTD shelter.

Director Daly asked if RTD still has the Adopt-a-Stop program and if so, is it working.  Bill Bottini said the program is still active.  He noted that the effectiveness of the program really depends on the entity adopting the stop; some fade in and out while others do very well.

Director Lubow inquired what other characteristics were being evaluated/developed to prioritize where RTD shelters are installed.  She wondered if a criterion might include a stop that has a large number of disabled patrons boarding.  Michael Washington shared that right now staff was just concluding an evaluation of the number of stops that meet the 40 or more boardings criteria.  He said that staff is looking at a way to prioritize stops with a large number of disabled riders but it is difficult to accurately measure; staff is trying to look at other factors like the number of senior centers within a certain distance of the stop.

Director Lasater asked if RTD has any policy for stops that have nothing but the RTD Flag (sign that signifies there is a bus stop).  He wonders if there is anything RTD can do to recycle old shelters.  He shared that he has experience restoring cars, many of which people believe are completely unsalvageable.  Director Lasater believes that there may be something RTD can do to salvage at least a few shelters a year, even if it means combining the best parts of two or three.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that once a shelter needs to be replaced it is in very bad shape; there have been no shelters that could be relocated to date.  Bill Bottini shared that staff does try to salvage what they can from shelters that are hit by cars or removed for some other reason than it needing to be replaced.

Director Bagley wondered if there are other agencies using the metal screens in their shelters.  He asked if staff could provide information on how many stops have a pull out for the bus versus it stopping in the traffic lane.  Bill Bottini informed the Board that he previously worked for the Colorado Springs transit agency and they only install shelters with the screens.

Committee Chair James indicated that he would like to expand on Director Bagley’s request for the number of pull out stops.  He would like to see a breakdown of all the types of stops, i.e. pull out, street, bulb outs, etc.  Henry Stopplecamp said staff would work to pull the information together.

Director Walker asked if the high boarding stops have any discernable characteristics such as transfer points, limited routes, etc.  Michael Washington stated that transfer points are stops with very high boardings.  He said that stops along the limited routes are high as well as schools, employment centers, etc.

Director Walker inquired if staff has noticed a higher level of rider pass up calls at stops with shelters because the passenger is not seen or paying attention.  Michael Washington said that is not something staff has studied but they will look into it.

Director Walker wondered how safety and security factored into shelter installation.  Henry Stopplecamp noted that bus shelters do get hit periodically by cars, which is why shelters are installed away from the curb.  He said that staff is always working with the local police departments and internal security to monitor the shelters; if something becomes a hot spot for certain activities RTD has removed them from certain locations.  Henry Stopplecamp stated that the safety of our patrons is the most important thing.

Director Deadwyler informed the Board that the shelters are not very accessible for people using mobility devices because the bench is very close to the entrance.  She asked if this could be looked at for future designs.  Henry Stopplecamp commented that a lot of the upcoming shelter review will be done in-house; he said he will make sure this is taken into consideration.

Director Hoy wonders why RTD guidelines have 40 as the minimum required boardings per day since we are unable to install shelters at all the stops that meet the requirement.  Henry Stopplecamp explained that RTD could change the number but right now staff wants it to remain at what RTD has always used for more consistent evaluation.

Director Solano asked if any of the shelters have lighting.  Bill Bottini said that currently the shelters do not have any lights inside but light comes from the surrounding street lights, parking lights, etc.  Henry Stopplecamp said that previously the technology was cost prohibitive but with solar technology becoming available it is something RTD can look at; however, it does become a maintenance issue.

Director Anderson pointed out that the advertising bus shelters were really a city function.  She asked if she was correct that RTD was not able to put notifications in these shelters.  She said if that was the case perhaps RTD could work with the various cities to make sure we have a way to notify people.  Scott Reed stated that RTD can only put information in RTD shelters because the advertising shelters are completely taken up by advertisements.

Director Rivera-Malpiede wondered who is responsible for the trash removal at all of our stops.  Bill Bottini stated that for RTD owned shelters RTD is responsible for trash removal.  Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Facilities, said that for non-RTD owned shelters and our other bus stops it is the property owner’s responsibility.  He shared that his team tries to contact the responsible party to make sure the trash is removed.

Director Folska asked for the definition of minority.  She stated that people with disabilities are minorities as well.  Michael Washington stated that under Title VI it is required that RTD look specifically at race.  Director Folska reiterated that people with disabilities are actually minorities too.  She hopes there is a way that when Title VI is discussed the Board and staff can try to include people with disabilities as well so everyone can be more efficient with RTD’s resources.  Michael Washington said that he agrees it is something that needs to be considered.

Committee Chair James asked for an inventory of RTD owned shelters, third-party shelters, and the number of stops with benches.  Michael Washington said that staff could provide an approximation but not definitive numbers as RTD relies on the amenity owner to notify us of its installation.

##### a. RTD Shelter Program 2014 0728

#### 2. RTD Strategic Plan 2015-2020

Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the August 5, 2014 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.  He said this is the first of four updates hopefully leading up to Board adoption of the Strategic Plan in Spring, 2015.  He explained that the goal of the Strategic Plan is to compliment the mission and vision that is already established at RTD.

Brian Welch pointed out that the staffing for the Strategic Plan includes five staff members reporting to Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, who make up the Strategic Plan Working Group.  It will also include a Strategic Plan Advisory Committee and the Senior Leadership Team.

Brian Welch noted that RTD’s mission statements, goals, themes, etc. are very common throughout other transit agencies; however, this will build on the mission and vision by adding more specific strategies, initiatives and performance measures that staff believes are unique to RTD.  The Strategic Plan will focus on 2015 to 2020 but will also look beyond 2020 since some of the items considered in the Plan will not be achieved within the next 5 years.

Brian Welch stated that the Strategic Plan will be successful to the extent to which the staff has adequately incorporated input and listened to all the people who will be affected.  Staff plans to get the word out through:

- Board of Directors Committee Meetings and Study Sessions

- Employee Brown Bag Lunches

- Employee Survey

- Public Survey

- Customer Access Panel

- Stakeholder Forum

Brian Welch reiterated that this is the first in a series of presentations to the Board, each with increasing levels of detail on the document.  He explained that at this time staff does not have the document far enough along to ask the Board for their input on the strategies or initiatives, but that will be coming soon.  He stated that the Board would be asked to adopt the Strategic Plan in Spring, 2015.

Director Menten noted that staff does not have any specific details for the plan; however, the timeline indicates an opportunity for Board feedback in August, 2014.  She wonders how the Board can provide feedback if there are no specifics.  Brian Welch explained that the purpose of this evening’s presentation was to provide the Board with information about how staff plans to approach the Strategic Plan and solicit public feedback/input.

Director Menten believes that this presentation indicated a priority on Transit Oriented Development.  She feels that from the Board and Senior Leadership Advance this was not one of the priorities identified.  Director Menten shared that in the community she represents, people have a lot of concerns about high density; if they wanted to live Downtown in high density areas they would do that.  She stated that is her feedback on the Plan at this time.

Director Lubow believes it is really important and incredibly wise for any organization to have strategic plans going out into the future; however, with that being said her impression is that what staff is proposing is not typical of strategic plans.  Director Lubow stated that traditionally, it is the Board’s role to set the goals.  Director Lubow read several quotes from the American Public Transportation Association Transit Board Member Handbook:

“Boards take the lead role in the strategic planning process, helping to create the future by defining the organization’s vision, mission, core values…”

“Often, a board retreat is the preferred setting for this collaborative work; this was the case for three-quarters of transit systems surveyed.”

“About two-thirds of transit agencies employed a consultant’s service to conduct pre-retreat interviews; create, disseminate, and analyze questionnaires; summarize the trend analyses and data; and facilitate discussion…”

Director Lubow noted the Handbook also stated that quarterly staff reports to the board and recommended that there should be a written agreement about how and when to update the strategic plan.  Director Lubow then quoted from the website Simply Strategic Planning:

“Simply put, put as simply as possible, it is the board’s role in strategic planning to set the organization’s goals.”

Director Lubow believes these quotes go along with the annual retreats that the Board does with senior leadership where, at that time, the Board sets the goals for the coming year.  She said it is staff’s responsibility to implement the goals; they have the experience, expertise, and time to put out the details.  Director Lubow stated that in a certain sense the starring role in strategic planning is the Board and she does not see that in the process staff is presenting.  She suggested that, because staff is more knowledgeable and experienced about transit issues, they put together a variety of goals the Board can consider; then, a facilitator can review the suggested goals with the Board, the Board can come up with our own ideas, and then vote on them. Director Lubow expressed concern that the approach for the strategic planning process does not give the Board the type of role a board would typically be given.  She hopes this will be considered as staff moves forward.

Brain Welch explained that staff’s intent is to start with the tactical goals that the Board developed during the advance as well as the vision and mission that are part of the RTD approach.  He stated that it was not staff’s intent to lessen the Board’s responsibility of policy direction.  He believes that when staff comes back with their next presentation, the Board will see that staff is presenting the Board with the type of options Director Lubow mentioned.  Brian Welch noted that staff could develop an approach that would have a more formal nature if that was the direction the Board wished to take.

Director Lasater noted that there is not a deadline for development of the Strategic Plan.  He suggested that maybe the process for the Strategic Plan should start at the annual advance, as this is really only a four month difference.  Director Lasater feels that a 5 to 20 year plan really needs more adequate discussion at the Board level when the Board can really get to the meat and potatoes of a discussion.  Director Lasater also suggested that the Strategic Plan needs to be worked on from the core out.  The Plan needs to start with an evaluation of why are we doing this, developing into the how we do it, and ending with the results.

Director Anderson expressed that she thought this was a very well thought out approach to the Strategic Plan.  She feels it is completely based on the issues that came out of the advance.  Director Anderson believes this approach plans well for Board input.  She appreciates that it also talks about listening to the community to determine if RTD is on the right track.  She reiterated that she does not feel it precludes any Board direction.  She said that she looks forward to working with staff and thinks they are on the right track.

Director Folska shared that she is really troubled and deeply disturbed about this recommendation.  She thinks that staff is way overreaching with this Plan.  She reminded everyone that the RTD Board is elected by 2.9 million people and is one of only three transit agencies with an elected board.  She believes that staff taking over the primary function of the Board for the next 5 to 20 years basically renders the Board irrelevant.  She asked Director Lubow to read an excerpt from the Regional Transportation District Act:

“32-9-109.5. Board of directors – membership – powers.  (4)  All powers, duties, functions, rights, and privileges vested in the district shall be exercised and performed by the board; except that the exercise of any executive, administrative, or ministerial powers may be delegated by the board to officers and employees of the district.”

Director Folska stated that those powers were afforded to the Board by the Colorado State Legislature.  It is a privilege that the Board represent the people within the District.  She reminded everyone that the Board’s primary role is the vision of the future of RTD and staff’s role is to come up with how that gets implemented.  Director Folska stated that while she appreciates staff’s intention she completely rejects this Plan.

Director Tobiassen thanked staff for putting together what he believes is a reasonable schedule that will allow the Board time to discuss the plan after gathering ideas and speaking with the public and stakeholders.  He requests that when staff goes out to the stakeholders that they include all the mayors, chambers of commerce, city transportation planners, etc. because getting their ideas on how public transportation in their areas will be very beneficial.  He said that he appreciates staff’s effort and looks forward to participating in the future.

Director Walker shares that when he read this document it was his understanding that the Strategic Plan would take the Annual Program Evaluation and Strategic Budget Plan and extend these out 20 years.  He noted that this is what the Board has already said we want to do.  He believes that staff is not usurping the Board’s power; they are just extending what the Board has already identified as goals, priorities, etc.  Director Walker thinks this is a good stop to get an idea of what is out there on the horizon.

Director Rivera-Malpiede expressed her support of the Plan as well.  She believes the employee brown bag lunches are so important as the employees are our riders too.  She feels that this is really a joint venture between the Board and staff.

Director Solano stated that he feels RTD should be under the strict instruction of what the State Legislature allows.  He believes that the current Board cannot plan 20 years out and assume the future Boards will agree.  He said this dilutes the power of the Board.

Committee Chair James said that he also believes this is a good idea.  He stated that anytime an organization thinks about the long-term future is it a good idea.  He feels there are adequate controls so the partnership the Board has with staff can accomplish the mission in the best way it can.  He reiterated that there are adequate controls in place for the Board.

Director Folska expressed her support of long-term strategic planning; however, she stressed that the Board does the what while staff does the how.  She stated that it is not a matter of controlling the process.  In this approach the Board is not even invited to the table nor are they on any committee.  Director Folska pointed out that staff will present to the Board four times and that is supposed to be adequate input.

##### a. 080514 Board Update Strategic Plan-final (4)

### C. Other Matters

Committee Chair James shared that he recently had a conversation with Tom Clark, CEO of the Metro Denver Economic Development Council.  He said the topic of the Southeast Extension came up and Tom Clark informed Director James are watching what the RTD Board does.  He informed the Board that Tom Clark told him that Charles Schwab would not have made such a significant move without the Board’s approval of the extension.  Director James believes this action is really creating good community development.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 6:57 p.m. to the Government Relations Committee.
