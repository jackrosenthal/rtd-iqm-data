Award of “Group 25” Contracted Fixed-Route Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the
provision of “Group 25” contracted fixed-route transit services with Veolia Transportation.
This contract is for three years for an amount not to exceed $66,874,659 with two (2)
one-year options in the amount of $24,271,326 (option year 1) and $25,140,353 (option
year 2), for a total five year not-to-exceed amount of $116,286,338. In addition, RTD will
reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately
$13,799,677 for the initial three year contract term, $4,816,129 for option year 1, and
$4,929,152 for option year 2, for a total of $23,544,958 for the five year period. This
results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $80,674,336 for the initial three year
contract period and $139,831,296 for the five year period. This proposal represents the
most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals

Director Folska asked if RTD had an SBE requirement due to
federal funding. Bruce Abel introduced Zamy Silva, Small
Business Office Manager. She replied that if this was a federal
funded project, there would be a Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise (DBE) requirement. The SBE goal is 5% because
this is a locally funded project. Director Folska further inquired
about the fuel and refund costs, value of buses provided to
Veolia and RTD’s hourly rate for internal employees. Bruce
Abel answered that the average bus costs $450,000. New
buses are distributed throughout all the RTD and contracted
garages. Greg Smith, Manager for Competitive Services,
pointed out the comparison cost chart on page 6 of the
Operations & Customer Service/Planning &
Development/Government Relations Committee Meetings
packet for July 1, 2014 illustrating RTD’s costs versus Veolia
Transportation’s.
Director Solano asked for clarification on the identity of Group
25. Greg Smith answered that the “Group XX” is a naming
convention which helps identify the services provided by each
contracted group. Director Solano asked how Veolia
Transportation received new buses and which area they serve.
Bruce Abel answered that the entire fleet of new buses is
distributed to all garages (RTD and contracted) as needed.
Veolia Transportation is located in Englewood and mostly
serves the southeast and southwest areas. For a listing of
specific routes served, Bruce Abel pointed the Directors to the
chart on pages 8 and 9 of the Operations & Customer
Service/Planning & Development/Government Relations
Committee Meetings packet for July 1, 2014.

final ranking represents the evaluation team’s conclusion that
the strengths of the Veolia Transportation technical and Small
Business Enterprise (SBE) proposal outweighed the strengths
of the MV Transportation and First Transit proposals and more
than offset the slight difference in cost.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

C. Updates
There were no updates presented to the Committee.

Bruce Abel updated the Board on the steps taken by the Fare Review Task Force to
address the Directors’ question from the June 10, 2014 Operations & Customers
Service Committee Meeting. Numerous interfaces with customers have been added
to receive input regarding the fare structure:
 Besides the non-profit community, the task force will convene five (5)
Formal Public Meetings through August: east, south, northwest, northeast,
and central.
 A Customer Panel representing all 15 Districts will convene on July 16th and
will address the topic.
 The Online Customer Community will be asked for feedback in July.
 RTD Fare Review Web Page will include a description of the Fare Review
Task Force and an email address to submit feedback. Periodic updates on
progress will be added to the web page and advertised on RTD’s home page.
 Using social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter) to ask for feedback.
 Transit Management Associations (TMAs)/Organizations (TMOs) and local
governments will be asked to participate in one focus group meeting on July
24th.
 Reports to the Board of Directors will be done bimonthly instead of
quarterly.
Director Bagley updated the Directors on the most recent General Manager’s
Oversight and Performance Management Committee Meeting held on July 1, 2014
at 3:00 p.m. prior to the Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting. He
mentioned the GM Oversight and Performance Committee, while discussing
changes to the 2015 General Manager’s Strategic Goals, had an extensive
conversation about the Fare Review Task Force and recommended an open public
process with individuals from all fifteen (15) Districts having input. He asked
Director Anderson to speak on behalf of the committee. Director Anderson
reiterated the importance of being inclusive and for all Districts to be represented.
The committee feels the fare Review is not a single item issue and it is an important
matter to everyone.
Director Folska acknowledged and applauded the staff for their responsiveness to
the Director’s requests. She also asked about fare box evasion rate and asked
Bruce Abel to speak about people with disabilities possibly evading rates. Bruce
Abel said that the light rail evasion rate is at 3% (three percent). Fare evasion in
buses and paratransit services is non-existent as customers have to interface with
the operator. Staff has heard stories of abled-people recruiting disabled people so
they can serve as their Personal Care Assistant (PCA). PCAs are not charged for

D. Other Matters

6.A

Director Menten asked if the Customer Panel who will participate in the Fare
Review is the same public Customer Panel that currently meets monthly. Bruce
Abel confirmed it is the same panel. Their next meeting will be on July 16th.
Meetings are typically at 5:30 p.m. and they have attendance confirmation from 13
out of the 15 members. Director Menten also asked for details on the
TMOs/TMAs/local government meeting and public meetings. Bruce Abel answered
that the local government meeting will be on July 24, time to be determined. The
5 public meetings are still to be determined. Director Menten asked to have the
information on all meetings added to the Director’s calendar as it becomes
available. She asked if a consultant has been chosen for the Fare Review Task
Force had been chosen. Bruce Abel answered that currently the Task Force is
evaluating the proposals received from the RFP.
Director Rivera-Malpiede echoed Director Folska’s sentiment for the responsiveness
and the inclusivity across the District. She also asked for the structure of the July
24th meeting. Bruce Abel said it would be a panel with representatives.
Director Lubow asked Bruce Abel to provide the Fare Review Public Engagement
Outline in report form to the Board. She also asked if the outline was in response
to the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee conversation.
Bruce Abel answered the plan was developed as a response to the Operations &
Customer Service Committee Meeting on June 10th. Noting the recent
recommendations from the GM Oversight Committee, Director Lubow asked if there
could still be any changes to the outline as a response to those recommendations.
Bruce Abel answered that there could be changes. Director Lubow thanked staff
for their responsiveness to the Director’s request. She shared a stakeholder’s
suggestion: creating a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which could share
input throughout the process, not just at the beginning and at the end. She noted
the TAC’s involvement does not have to be extensive. Bruce Abel answered that
experience shows it is counterproductive to go the public with a blank slate. The
current process allows for public feedback before the Task Force works with the
consultant and once a proposal is created. He acknowledged Director Lubow’s
request of more public involvement during the process.

fare. These stories are anecdotal, not overwhelming nor pose a problem to
services. Director Folska asked Bruce Abel to expound on if phony PCAs support is
an issue on paratransit services. He responded it would be much more challenging
given the process that paratransit uses for ticketing.

B. Recommended Actions

• RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will
permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in early 2015 which
specifies the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 15, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
reminded the Board that this item had been reviewed at last
month’s Planning and Development Committee Meeting. He
noted that this action relates to advancing State Highway
119’s arterial bus rapid transit (BRT) project. Bill Van Meter
reiterated that this is supporting the highest consensus priority
from the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for BRT. He
informed the Board that earlier in the year Boulder County,
using the NAMS results, submitted this to DRCOG for
inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP);
DRCOG’s RTP scoring criteria indicate that this project is
eligible for inclusion in the fiscally-constrained RTP and would
be eligible for future federal funding participation through the
DRCOG Transpiration Improvement Program (TIP).

Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen were absent.

6.B

Bill Van Meter shared that staff projects that SH 119 BRT can
be funded in the early 2020s; however, staff intends to pursue
opportunities to accelerate project planning, environmental and
design work, and to explore financing options to accelerate the
project completion date.
Bill Van Meter pointed out that in speaking with DRCOG staff
there is a clarification that needs to be made in the language
of the Board Report. There is a sentence that reads:
“Discussions with DRCOG staff have indicated that RTD
should submit the SB 208 report in early 2015.” He clarified
that DRCOG staff is not trying to dictate when RTD submits
the report so the wording should have been “could” not
“should”.
Director Folska noted that while this action is based on the
findings of the NAM Study the Board has yet to receive a copy
of the final study report. She stressed that she is deeply
troubled that the Board has not gotten a copy of a report that
RTD paid $2.1 million for. She believes that the cost of $57
million in 2013 dollars versus $75 million in YOE would be in
the report along with the amounts for the other six arterial
BRTs. Director Folska shared that it is really helpful for her to
be able to look at the whole project in its entirety rather than
in drips and drabs. Director Folska said that she could not
support the approval of the NAMS consensus statement
previously and she would not be able to support this action
either. She reiterated that she could not support something
that she has not been able to read. Bill Van Meter stated that
Director Folska was correct that the Board has not received
the final report; however, he said that staff was still working
to finalize the report. He explained that staff was waiting for
Board approval to finalize the priorities before the report would
Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bill Van Meter said that as outlined in the Board Report, the
cost of the SH 119 BRT is estimated to be approximately $57
million in 2013 dollars and $75 million in Year of Expenditure
(YOE) dollars. The expectation is that the funding breakdown
for BRT in the corridor would be as follows:
 50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
 50 percent from DRCOG TIP funds through the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement
(CMAQ) funds and/or Surface Transportation Program
(STP)-Metro funds.

6.B

be complete. Director Folska stated that the consensus
statement could be an addendum to the final report. She
reiterated how unacceptable it is that the Board does not yet
have the final report when the NAMS began in April of 2013.

Director Hoy asked when the Board was supposed to be
receiving the final NAMS report and when they would actually
be receiving it. Bill Van Meter stated that the final report
would be done in August. He shared that the final report was
always planned to be completed within a couple months of
when the study was complete. The goal was for the study to
be done in Spring of 2014; however, reaching final consensus
did take slightly longer than planned.
Director Hoy wondered if there was a submission deadline for
the SB 208 submission. He wondered if this item was not
moved forward at this time would that delay the process.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that this resolution
does two things:
1) It asks DRCOG to include SH 119 BRT in the RTP. RTD
has applied for a federal grant that we might not be
eligible for if this is not in DRCOG’s RTP.
2) Inclusion in the RTP allows staff to submit an SB 208
Report in early 2015
Marla Lien reiterated that the goal is to get SH 119 BRT in the
RTP to allow RTD to receive a planning grant. Bill Van Meter
pointed out that this makes no commitment of RTD dollars;
this is just a mechanism that allows this project to be included
in the RTP so down the road RTD is eligible for a federal grant.
Director Anderson stated that the TIP is a list of projects; staff
is asking the Board to approve getting SH 119 BRT on that list
for the RTP so that it can be included in DRCOG’s 2040
Transportation Plan. She reiterated that this is just complying
with the DRCOG process so that RTD can be eligible for
federal funds if the Board decides to move this forward with
this project in the future. Bill Van Meter said that was a very
accurate assessment.

Director Deadwyler stated that she would be voting no on this
recommendation for many of the reasons stated by Director
Folska. She agrees that the Board needs to see the final
report before moving forward.

Director Lubow shared that she will be voting for this
resolution because she does not want to see anything the
Board does inadvertently interfere with BRT on 119, which
everyone believes is good for the people of the corridor. She
thanked Director Anderson for her very helpful explanation.
She wonders if the Board waited two months before approving
this resolution, so the final report could be available, would
have a negative impact on getting funding for SH 119. Bill
Van Meter explained that during July, DRCOG will be working
through their approval process of the list for the RTP so
waiting is not a good option. He commented that staff does
have a lot of documents that formulate the basis of the entire
report that were shared with the NAMS Technical and Policy
Advisory Committees (TAC and PAC). Bill Van Meter offered
to compile this information for the Board so that it may be
reviewed before the July 15, 2014 Board meeting; however,
he pointed out that all the substantive information reviewed by
the TAC and PAC has also been shared with the Board
throughout the process.
Committee Chair James thought Bill Van Meter’s suggestion
would be an appropriate foundation for this resolution.
Director Lubow also thought this might be an acceptable
solution for some of the other Directors that are distressed
about not having the final report.
Director Bagley believes that one of the most important things
to remember is that, as Bill Van Meter said, staff has been
sharing this information with the Board all along; the final
report will not be vastly different from what the Board has
already seen. He wondered if SH 119 BRT would be
considered a fixed guideway corridor. Director Bagley noted
that if this is considered a fixed guideway it will require 10
‘yes’ votes to be passed.
Director Folska requested that Jacob Rigger, DRCOG
Transportation Planning Coordinator, answer several
questions. She said her sense is that staff and DRCOG believe
RTD should get in the queue to be eligible for funding and if
we do not end up needing it then RTD will not ask for it; she
wondered if that was a correct assessment of DRCOG’s
position. She also wondered why DRCOG wanted the
language change from “should” to “could” as outlined by Bill
Van Meter. Jacob Rigger stated that DRCOG has been in
ongoing discussion with RTD staff about an SB 208 submittal
Packet Pg. 36

6.B

Director Folska stated that she believes the RTD Board could
wait to get the final report, read it, approve it and then submit
the project for the RTP. Jacob Rigger said that DRCOG
believes RTD has some flexibility on the SB 208 process;
however, he indicated that DRCOG would ask that RTD not
wait on is indicating if RTD would like this project included in
the RTP. DRCOG needs to continue to move forward in their
process to they would like some indication from RTD as to
where we stand.
Director Folska asked if an amendment could be made to the
resolution. Committee Chair James indicated that would be
more appropriate at the Board meeting.

C. Updates

• 16th Street Mall Update
Stan Szabelak, Engineering Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point with
the Board that is available in the July 1, 2014 Planning and Development
Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.
Committee Chair James thanked Stan Szabelak for a great presentation on
one of our major assets in Denver. He noted that the 16 th Street Mall is one
of the most visited attractions by people from out of town. It is also the
gateway to Downtown and Civic Center from Denver Union Station.
Director Folska shared that she thinks it is wonderful that all the work for
the Mall is being done in a collaborative effort. She believes that the Mall is
truly a treasure. She asked what the cost is per block for renovations.

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

versus the 2040 Transportation Plan, specifically does SH 119
BRT need to go before the DRCOG Board before it can be in
the 2040 Plan. He said at this point his team believes that will
not be a requirement; this gives RTD and DRCOG more time to
complete the SB 208 process later.

6.B

Director Daly wondered if the moratorium of construction on the Mall after
Thanksgiving was because of all the festivities. He also asked if there was
any discussion of extending the granite pavers past Market Street. Rick
Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Program, stated that was
correct in regard for the construction moratorium. Stan Szabelak noted that
there had been discussion of extending the granite pavers past Market Street
but when RTD said that we would not maintain those pavers the discussion
went away.
Director Walker wondered what would happen to the two driveways that go
into the former Market Street Station Bus Concourse. Stan Szabelak stated
that the driveway adjacent to Blake Street will remain open for use if the
facility is turned into underground parking as planned. The other driveway
will be blocked by walkways, curbs, etc.
Director Menten wondered if the signs shown for the new Market Street
Mall Shuttle locations have already been ordered. She noted how confusing
they might be as there was no reference to the W-Line. Stan Szabelak said
that the signs had not been ordered but she brought up some very good
details that would be taken into consideration as the signs are finalized.
Director Hoy asked for confirmation that RTD’s only responsibility for
maintenance was the driving surface. Stan Szabelak said that was correct
that RTD’s agreement for maintenance is just for the transit lanes. He noted
that the 16th Street Mall reconstruction will include things like furnishings,
landscaping, etc. due to the nature of the FTA Grant that was requested but
RTD will not be responsible for maintaining these things.
Director Hoy wondered if the funding for the realignment at Market Street
Station was coming from RTD funding and if so, was it out of Base Funding
or FasTracks Funding. Rick Clarke said that staff would have to get back to
the Board with the information.
Director Rivera-Malpiede wondered who was responsible for snow removal
at the 16th Street Mall Shuttle stops. She noted how slippery the granite
can be when wet and snowy. Stan Szabelak said the responsibility of snow
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 1, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska also wondered if perhaps concrete, that can be made to look
like granite, might be more durable and cost effective. Stan Szabelak
shared that when the Urban Design Study was completed in 2008, the
estimated cost to reconstruct the entire Mall was $65 million. Committee
Chair James informed the Board that there was a committee that he cochaired, the 16th Street Steering Committee, that went through a process to
determine that granite pavers were wanted on the mall. He said it was very
clear from the stakeholders that the granite pavers should remain.

6.B

removal for the entire mall is the responsibility of the Downtown Denver
Partnership. Committee Chair James noted that one of the considerations in
keeping the granite pavers was that they are slippery, but in spite of that the
decision was made to keep the pavers.

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

Director Folska noted that safety along the mall is a big concern. She
believes they are roughing up the granite pavers to they are more like
concrete and not as slippery. Stan Szabelak commented that using pellets
and high pressure water does realize the granite to help keep its surface
from being as slippery; however, it does not take long for dirt and soot to
build up on the pavers so ongoing maintenance is very important.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions presented to the Board.

C. Updates

• Federal Update - Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, from Squire Patton Boggs, noted that there will not be a lot of
business in D.C. after the July 4th recess.
Mike Dino said the House passed their version of the Transportation
Appropriation’s Bill on June 10th. The Senate sub-committee passed their
version on June 5th. The bill is stalled out in the Senate because of
disagreements on amendments. The Senate’s version is more generous
towards transit. Squire Patton Boggs will continue to monitor these items as
they are of interest to RTD. Appropriations will possibly be addressed during
a “lame duck” session after the November election.
He stated that of near term concern for RTD is the Transportation
Reauthorization and the Highway Trust Fund Solvency. He pointed out that
Transportation Secretary Foxx wrote to each State Department of
Transportation’s Chief Executive Officer addressing this matter. Plans to
address funding on the highway aspect will start to be implemented in
August. Any impacts for transit funding will be seen in December through
formula money. Full funding grant agreement will not be affected by the
fund’s insolvency as they come from a different line item. No significant
ideas have been put forth to extend the highway trust fund.
Director Lubow asked if bus services would decrease if formula funding is
affected. Mike Dino said that he could not answer that question. He

Packet Pg. 41

Chair Sisk and Director Tobiassen were absent.

6.C

pointed out that RTD has always been able to cope effectively. Terry
Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, replied that RTD does not anticipate
reaching that point. RTD currently receives about 12% or $55 million for its
preventive maintenance. Staff is working on a letter on behalf of General
Manager Phil Washington to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
addressing those concerns.

Director Folska expressed her concerns about RTD’s Trust Fund funding
since she believes there will not be a serious discussion about the matter in
Congress until January, 2015. She asked what part of RTD base operations
is funded by the Trust Fund. Terry Howerter said the preventive
maintenance comes from the Trust Fund. Director Folska said she was
under the impression that RTD Operations is funded from the Trust Fund.
She expressed her concern if there would be a necessity to operate from a
deficit, increase fares, or cut services. The last two scenarios would mean
RTD needs to give the public a six (6) months warning under Title VI. Terry
Howerter clarified that preventive maintenance is funded through the Trust
Fund through transfer of funds to transit funds. He further said that if $55
million would be lost it would have an impact on RTD and that would be
evaluated at that time. Director Folska asked for clarification on RTD’s
reserve funds. Terry Howerter said the RTD base has three (3) months of
reserve funds. FasTracks has two (2) months and funds are about to reach
the third month.

There were no other matters presented to the Board.

B. Citizens Advisory Committee
Hugh Wilson, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, thanked the Board for
the opportunity to report on the CAC’s activities. He shared that in May the CAC
did not meet as a committee after all the festivities for the Denver Union Station
Grand Opening but they did have a tour of the East Line at the end of the month.
He said the committee was very impressed by the degree of progress along the
Line.
Hugh Wilson stated that the CAC had their quarterly meeting in Boulder on June
18th to solicit citizen input and feedback. He said that unfortunately there was no
public in attendance for this particular meeting. Hugh Wilson noted that there was
a pretty torrential downpour that evening which would have deterred attendees.
He pointed out that additionally, there has been a lot of activity in this area already
through the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) so the public may feel like they
have been adequately heard. Hugh Wilson shared that the CAC did have a great
opportunity to speak with Chair Sisk that evening; the CAC also received a great
update on the final NAMS outcome and the RTD TIGER grant application for Bus
Rapid Transit.
Chair Sisk thanked the CAC for coming to Boulder. He really appreciates the
commitment of the members. Chair Sisk thought it was great to be able to partake
in a discussion with them. He said that he hopes the CAC is not discouraged by
the lack of public turnout in Boulder. Hugh Wilson said that the CAC members are
very committed and plan to continue to outreach throughout the District.

C. Recommended Actions
Regional Transportation Plan (Baseline Report)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit
staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on
FasTracks in conformance with DRCOG’s request for ongoing review of
the FasTracks Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as outlined by DRCOG
Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and project
elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report, will
be included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently
being prepared by DRCOG.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 15, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, and
General Manager Washington reviewed a Power Point with the
Board that is available in the July 8, 2014 FasTracks
Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
Bill Van Meter noted that the goals of the presentation are to
provide the Board with 1) more background on the DRCOG
authority for approving fixed guideways under SB 208, 2) an
update of FasTracks projects staff is planning to submit for the
DRCOG 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), 3) a
schedule for the Southeast Rail Extension, and 4) a summary
of the next steps.
Bill Van Meter explained that SB90-208 (referred to as SB
208), enacted in 1990, grants DRCOG the authority to
approve a fixed guideway transit system, specifically in the
method of financing and technology selected. He noted that
all RTD FasTracks projects need to be identified not only in SB
208 but also in DRCOG’s 2040 Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP), which DRCOG is in the process of developing. Bill Van
Meter stated that FasTracks projects must be included in the

Packet Pg. 45

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Approval to submit the RTD FasTracks Projects for the DRCOG 2040

6.D

RTP for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) approval
and to be eligible for federal funding.

Bill Van Meter reminded the Board that this action is simply to
get all the FasTracks projects articulated and identified in the
RTP. He reiterated that by including the Southeast Rail
Extension in the RTP, keeping it in the New Starts pipeline,
could result in a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) of $92
million in 2016. He noted that RTD has a good relationship
with the FTA for delivering projects as promised; moving
forward with the Southeast Rail Extension is important in
maintaining this relationship and building on RTD’s history of
success in receiving federal funds.
Bill Van Meter outlined the Southeast Rail Extension funding
commitments as follows:
 Federal contribution (FFGA) – $92 million or 44.3%
 DRCOG 1st commitment in principle (CMAQ) – $7.5
million or 3.6%
 Local Stakeholder cash commitment – $25 million or
12.1%
 Local Stakeholder right-of-way – $9.2 million or 4.4%
 RTD-previously-committed funding (2014 APE) – $8.1
million or 3.9%
 RTD required additional match – $65.6 million or
31.6%
Bill Van Meter noted that on a project with a projected total
cost of $207.4 million, RTD’s contribution would only be
$73.7 million or 35.5%.
General Manager Washington said that as staff had discussed
with the Board previously, the FasTracks Baseline Report for
inclusion in the DRCOG RTP is a requirement for all FasTracks
Projects, not just the Southeast Extension. He stressed that
not including projects in the RTP would preclude these
projects from moving forward; RTD cannot accept any federal

Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bill Van Meter informed the Board that DRCOG asked for
RTD’s Baseline Report for our FasTracks Projects by August 1,
2014. He said that everything staff intends to submit to
DRCOG is in conformance with the Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) that was approved by the Board in May 2014, with the
exception of the noteworthy revision to the Southeast Rail
Extension Project.

6.D

General Manager Washington noted that there had been
several questions asked that he wanted to answer.
1) Why the Southeast Extension: it is a good candidate for
federal funding in terms of the cost effective index,
ridership, etc. He said that in evaluating the remaining
projects this is the best candidate for federal funding.
2) Is the stakeholder contribution enough: this contribution
is the largest RTD has ever received from the local area
stakeholders on a FasTracks corridor since we began.
3) How much is the developer providing for the local
stakeholder cash contribution: staff will not know the
breakdown until the terms of the Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) are negotiated.
4) What happens if the Board does not approve this item:
staff is concerned that RTD will lose credibility at the
federal level for future requests.
5) Can these funds be used for other projects: FFGA funds
are requested for specific projects and therefore cannot
be used for anything else.
6) How will RTD’s contribution be funded: RTD would
issue sales tax revenue bonds.
7) Why have the ridership projections changed: DRCOG is
always updating their land use models which can in
turn impact our ridership projections. The Southeast
ridership projections changed along with all the other
corridors.
General Manager Washington pointed out that the local
contribution leaves just 35.5% of the total project cost to be
contributed by RTD; there is no other FasTracks project where
RTD can contributed 35.5% and get a complete project done.
He said that the name of the game is who leverages best to
get projects done and he believes this is a very good leverage
of RTD dollars.
General Manager Washington reiterated that in regards to a
‘no’ vote or tepid approval by the Board, he believes that
sends a negative message to our federal partners that RTD is
not totally committed; walking away from a FFGA of $92
million and a local commitment of $30-$40 million is not good
public policy. General Manager Washington is concerned that
a ‘no’ vote on this action will prevent RTD from pursuing
Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

dollars unless the projects are included in the DRCOG RTP or
through an amendment.

6.D

federal funds for any other corridors; a ‘no’ vote will ruin
RTD’s credibility.

General Manager Washington commented that this is really
just a snapshot in time. He said that RTD will not know if
these projections have an impact unless we move into the
next stage.
Director Lubow stated that she would be voting against this
proposal. She said that it is not because she thinks it is a bad
proposal but she is concerned for what it will do to the
projects that are left behind, which are in her area. Director
Lubow noted that if one corridor goes forward, that means it
pushes back the time that the other corridors have to wait to
access FasTracks funding. She commented that while the
results of the NAMS did say that the community wanted BRT,
that is only for the short term; it is only because her
community is not getting rail in the immediate future. Director
Lubow shared that she truly believes that government has a
responsibility to fulfill its contracts with the people, which is
not happening in her community. She expressed that as a
matter of principle she has to vote against this
recommendation. General Manager Washington said that it is
staff’s opinion that a ‘no’ vote by the Board actually
negatively affects the other corridors because of its impact on
RTD’s ability to get future federal dollars. He stated that
foregoing $92 million on a project sends a very bad message
when we go try to ask for more.
Director Folska thanked staff for a very thorough, detailed, and
in-depth overview. She noted that Bill Van Meter said that
DRCOG is providing 3.6% or $7.5 million for the Southeast
Extension, as they have done on all our FasTracks projects.
She wonders if that means they have provided 3.6% of the
total project cost or a flat amount of $7.5 million for each
Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly wondered what the new ridership numbers for
the Southeast are. He also asked how it might impact RTD’s
FFGA request. Bill Van Meter said that they are down slightly
due to changes in employment and demographic projections.
This leads to ridership dropping from about 9,200 per day to
7,100 per day. Bill Van Meter noted that at one time this
would have been pretty serious; however, with recent changes
from MAP-21 staff feels confident that this is a good project in
all the categories evaluated.

6.D

Director Folska stated that she believes RTD’s contribution for
the Southeast Extension is significantly small compared to
what we have paid for other projects. She thinks it is great
that the people of the community were willing to commit
16.5% of the project cost versus just the required 2.5%. She
wonders why RTD has not proposed working in partnership
with Douglas County to leverage their right-of-way for
Certificates of Participation (COPs) as Douglas County is only
going to benefit when the property values go up. Terry
Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that COPs require a
clean collateral, so when there is a federal interest we cannot
do COPs. Director Solano asked for a clarification why COPs
and federal monies could not be used for the same asset.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that COPs could actually
be used when there were federal funds as RTD has done with
a number of assets1. Terry Howerter stated that for this
corridor to step-up and contributed 16.5% is huge compared
to what RTD has received elsewhere. He said that the
proposed financing fits well within the model and the finance
team is ready to move forward with Board approval.
Director Anderson stated that in all the years she has worked
within the community, even though each area wanted to be
first to get FasTracks built, everyone still worked together for
the whole region, not just their own benefit. She said that
recently a memo was brought to her attention from the year
2000 from the City of Arvada representative to the US36 MIS
Policy Committee. She read the memo aloud to demonstrate
that the FasTracks process has always been one of
compromise and support within the Denver region so the
entire FasTracks system could be built out. Director Folska
called for a point of order and requested that Director
Anderson present this document that she read and enter it into
the record of this evening’s discussion. Director Solano
Seconded the request. Director Anderson indicated she would
not have a problem providing this to staff as this is a public
document2. The Board office has been unable to attain a
direct copy of this memo.

There was some confusion about the issue of COPs so further discussion was taken offline.
Director Anderson did provide excerpts from this memo, a copy of which can be found in the
Board Meeting minutes file located in the Board office.

project. Bill Van Meter stated that DRCOG provides $7.5
million for each project.

6.D

Chair Sisk thanked staff for an excellent presentation. He
noted the tremendous amount of work that has gone into this
report. Chair Sisk recognized that everyone is trying to do
what is best for their respective districts, but the Board also
needs to look at what is best for the entire District. He shared
that is why he has a different perspective than Directors
Lubow and Solano; he feels this is something important for the
Board to come together as a group and support.
Chair Sisk noted that that a letter from the local stakeholders
indicated a right-of-way contribution of $15 million but in the
chart presented by staff it was actually only $9.2 million. He
asked for an explanation of the discrepancy. He also
requested a breakdown of how the $9.2 million was
calculated. Bill Van Meter stated that until the details of an
IGA are worked out staff cannot put a final value on the
contributions so they took a conservative value. He also
noted that the letter from stakeholders also referenced other
in-kind contributions such as permit waivers that would be in
addition to the $9.2 million in right-of-way determined by
staff.
Director Bagley reminded the Board that this action was
initiated by the Board that sat at that time in August of 2012;
however, it was under discussion previous to that action. He
stated that there has been a lot of work done on this project.
Director Bagley requested the updated ridership projections for
all corridors, including those in operation, prior to the vote at
the Board meeting.
Director Bagley noted that the FasTracks program has been
going on since 2004. He stated that he fully and categorically
supports moving this action forward. He said that RTD has an
exemplary history of obtaining federal money, going as far
back as the Southwest corridor. RTD has been a partner with
the current Obama Administration in getting federal monies for
the last 5.5 years. He commented that this Administration
has specifically said that one of their major and important
focuses is infrastructure; what RTD is doing is exactly what

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano stated that at this time he was a borderline
‘no’. He thinks that everything is starting to go south again
when we need to go north; the north has gotten the short end
of the stick for a number of years.

6.D

Director Bagley stated that approving this recommendation
also sends a message to the economic development
community. FasTracks is one of the major reasons that the
Denver metro area has the economic development that exists
today. He noted that in many other places in the state that
economic development does not exists.
Director Bagley said that for all the reasons he mentioned the
vote needs to be positive.
Director Walker commented that the action before the Board
gets the Southeast Extension to engineering where the project
has to go someday anyway. He said this also supports
regional transportation, which is what he has been dreaming
of since he moved to Denver. Director Walker stated that the
last thing RTD wants to do is have the feds look at us as if we
do not have our act together. He believes that as long as
there is an opportunity to build in any corridor RTD should take
advantage of that.
Director James stated that he agrees with the Directors who
have expressed the need to think regionally, not locally. He
shared that he may act a lot locally but when he comes to this
table as a Board member he tries to think regionally as much
as possible. He expressed his belief is staff’s assertion that a
‘no’ vote on this recommendation will contaminate RTD’s
relationship with our partners and will be a detriment to
FasTracks projects not yet built.
Director Rivera-Malpiede expressed her wholehearted support
of this recommendation. She noted that she was on the Board
when the Southeast Extension was first voted on in 2012.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she knew the entire
FasTracks project would really put the Denver-Boulder area on
Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the Administration wants to see done in order to accelerate
this economy. He expressed that he could not be more
appreciative of Director Anderson’s comments. He shared
that the reason he wore his shirt was that it says RTD, not
MTD or my transportation district; the Board is in this
together. He stated that the message the Board sends to
RTD’s partners needs to be that we are all in this together to
make sure FasTracks gets completed. Director Bagley pointed
out that even though this is not in his District he fully supports
building the Southeast Rail Extension.

6.D

Director Menten pointed out that when she looks at the cost
estimates she sees the cost of the Southeast Extension going
up. She asked what the original cost estimate was in 2004
when approved by the voters as she believes it has gone up
since then. General Manager Washington stated that when
staff was referencing the cost decreasing that was in relation
to the cost in the 2014 APE, not when it was originally
approved. He said that everything has gone up from the
original plan. Director Menten requested to see the original
projection.
Director Menten stated that she had never heard that a 2.5%
local match was required by the FTA. Bill Van Meter said that
she was correct; the 2.5% match is an RTD requirement, as
approved by the Board. He noted that the FTA requirement is
a minimum of 20% local dollars, including RTD funds;
however, in practice it is really a 50% match.
Director Menten asked if the application for the FFGA would
include how DRCOG calculated the new ridership projection of
7,200. Bill Van Meter said that an overview of what went
into the projections could be included.
Committee Chair Lasater noted that the cost being discussed
this evening did not include some previous expenditures of
around $40-50 million for the purchase of additional rail cars.
Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
said that the figure was around $31.5 million.
Committee Chair Lasater said that it was his understanding
that because of the reduction of riders, RTD had also reduced
the parking at the RidgeGate Park-n-Ride. He asked if it was
correct that now for opening day there will be 700 spots
instead of the originally planned 2000 and by 2035 there will
be 2100 down from 3600. Bill Van Meter Stated that was
correct.

the map as a viable city for transportation. Director RiveraMalpiede stated that RTD’s staff is outstanding. She said she
is asked at all the conferences she attends how RTD has such
a great staff. Director Rivera-Malpiede commented that she
knows the people of her District would support this vote and
she will as well.

6.D

Director Bagley stated that the local cash share as defined is
12.1%. He said that this is a big cash infusion. Most of the
other corridors’ 2.5% local match has been in right-of-way,
permit fees, etc. He reiterated how significant a local match
of 12.1% in cash is. He does not believe that any of the other
corridors are prepared to come up with that kind of a cash
contribution.
Director Lubow expressed concern about the statement of
other corridors not being willing to bring forth the same large
cash contribution. She believes that when the voters
approved FasTracks, they did not do it with the understanding
that the people without money do not get FasTracks. Her
opinions is that the Board has to be very careful in speaking
like that.
Chair Sisk asked how many Directors needed to vote ‘yes’ for
this item to move to the Board meeting given the fact that
someone would be abstaining. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
stated that there would still need to be a vote in favor of the
majority of Directors present.

Committee Chair Lasater commented that the 16% local
match really shows their commitment to the project; however,
he is struggling with a personal moral conflict so he will be
abstaining from the vote. Director Menten asked if he could
further explain his conflict. Committee Chair Lasater shared
that he campaigned on the message of last in, last served and
he feels this goes against that; however, he recognizes the
huge commitment from the stakeholders so that is why he is
still conflicted.

Transfer Center
It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into a construction contract with M.A.
Mortenson Company in the amount of $10,899,258.23 for the construction
of the Central Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus Transfer Center, which will
serve the East Rail Line Central Park Station, regional and local buses and
the local neighborhood. Funding for this project is included in the 2014
Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project
for the Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 15, 2014
Board meeting.
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Cory Granrud, Manager of Park-n-Ride Design, reviewed a
Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the
July 8, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet.
Director Folska thanked Cory Granrud for a great presentation.
She noted that he discussed having Access-a-Ride within the
transit center. She asked if anyone on staff had tried to get
Access-a-Ride to pick them up from a station because it will
not happen. Director Folska stated that she does not believe
that staff is having individuals with disabilities provide input
into the facilities. She finds this very concerning, noting that
this was the case at Denver Union Station as well.
Director Folska asked why staff was proposing a surface
parking lot rather than a structure. She also asked how many
ADA spaces were planned. Rick Clarke stated that the
primary driving factor in selecting a surface lot was cost. He
noted that the lot is being designed so there is the possibility
to build a structure at a later date. Cory Granrud said that
there will be 38 ADA spaces. Director Folska asked if that
was the minimum number required. She feels that RTD should
look at the minimum number as the floor, not the celling. Cory
Granrud said that 38 was the minimum number required.

6.D

Director Lubow said that she did not see any analysis on how
the contractor was selected. She wondered how staff made
their decision. Rick Clarke explained that this was a design,
bid, build contract so in those instances staff selects the
lowest qualified bidder. He said that staff is recommending
M.A. Mortenson Company, who was $1 million less than the
other bidder.
Director Lubow asked if staff has looked into any Transit
Oriented Development (TOD) opportunities around the transit
facility. She hopes that staff is looking at this with all our
stations. Cory Granrud stated that staff has identified one
location that is being targeted for TOD.
Director Menten noted that the plans included charging
stations for electric cars as well as solar panels. She wonders
if RTD plans to charge people for using the stations. She also
expressed concern that solar technology does not really pay
for itself and can be very expensive. Rick Clarke stated that
for both of these items the infrastructure is just being put in so
the option to use it is there in the future. He said that staff is
applying for grants for the charging stations. Rick Clarke also
said that in relation to solar technology, it can be expensive
when retrofitting something but it is relatively inexpensive to
build into the infrastructure from the beginning.
Director Rivera-Malpiede expressed that she is very pleased
with the DBE goal of 27%. She shared that there is a TOD
station area plan that has been created by the Stapleton
community and unanimously approved by the Denver City
Council in 2012. She believes it will really be a catalyst for
the Northeast quadrant.
Director Solano pointed out that this area boarders his District.
He wonders if there might be some opportunities to work
together with the North Metro Line and the TOD through bus
service.

Director Folska pointed out how difficult it can be for a visually
impaired rider to locate the right bus when there are a large
number of bus gates. She asked staff to look into providing
better audible signage. She also expressed concern that a
visually impaired rider will not be able to locate an emergency
telephone as the only indicator that one exists is a blue light.
She suggested that these phones have a pinging sound.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2015 - 2020 Strategic Budget Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP).
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 15, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, noted that the
Directors have received updates on the 2015-2020 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) since March, 2014. He then introduced
Jannette Scarpino, Manager for Budget and Financial Analysis.
She presented the SBP starting on page 85 of the July 8,
2014 FasTracks Monitoring/Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Meeting Packet for approval. She noted the SBP is
RTD’s six year financial plan updated annually. The attached
SBP incorporates the 2014 amended budget and includes all
known adjustments and best estimates at this time. She
pointed out the SBP is balanced through the six year period
after incorporating into the projections both the June sales/use
tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business and
reductions, eliminations or deferrals of SBP requested projects.
No service reductions are proposed in the SBP throughout this
period. She also highlighted the revenue and operating
expenses estimated for the SBP period.

Director Folska asked if the assumed 10% fare increase for
2016 was for the $2.25 fare. Jannette Scarpino replied that
the assumed fare increase would be across the board.
Director Folska pointed out that RTD is in the process of
reviewing the fare structure through a Fare Task Force and
asked if it would be reasonable to know if an increase would
happen in 2016. General Manager Phil Washington answered
that the Fare Task Force will have results by the 3rd or 4th
quarter of 2015 in order to be implemented in 2016. He also
clarified that the Board will engage in a fare analysis every 3
years. At that time the board can consider an increase, a
decrease, or remaining at the same level. Director Folska
pointed out that a 10% fare increase seems insignificant when
compared to an almost $500 million operational budget.
Director Lubow asked if fare increases have historically been
at 10%. She also asked how a different amount would affect
the SBP. Jannette Scarpino answered that the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) is typically 2-3% annually. The 10% figure
for a 3 year period is an average. She added that a different
CPI would certainly affect the SBP. The presented SBP has a
positive balance partly due to a fare increase assumption. She
also noted that on every SBP staff works on expenses that
can be reduced. Operating costs are the last expenses to be
affected.
Director Bagley confirmed with Jannette Scarpino that the SBP
is for the base system and not for any FasTracks components.
Under this distinction, staff doesn’t perceive an increase in
ridership affecting the SBP.
Director Solano asked if any study has looked into if lowering
the fare rate would lead to an increase in ridership. Terry
Howerter said staff looks at elasticity whenever changes are
considered. He noted this is one of the items the Fare Task
Force will look into. Terry Howerter mentioned that staff used
the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG)
predictions when assuming no growth in ridership. He added
that the last fare increase was in 2011 and that assuming a
fare increase every 3 years helped balance the SBP. Without
fare increases it would be hard to keep pace with operating
expenses. Director Solano noted that he had more questions
that he would like to think through.
Director Bagley noted that when looking at fare changes it is
important to take into consideration fare box revenue. He
Packet Pg. 60

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 8, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.E

mentioned one of the goals of the Fiscal Sustainability Task
Force from a few years ago was to raise the fare box revenue
from 20% to 25%. RTD is moving toward reaching that
objective. Terry Howerter mentioned that staff needs to
report to the Board on this matter. General Manager
Washington added that the Fare Task Force’s work would
contribute to the fare box recovery rate, which includes
passes and other types of fare media. He also reminded the
Directors to not make any assumptions on the results from
Fare Task Force. Currently RTD is on an unsustainable course
with expansions, operations, and people who think the rates
should be lower. At some point, RTD will have to do
something.
Director Folska asked why RTD could not get additional
revenue from alcohol and tobacco sales taxes. Sales tax
parity and marijuana tax have proven successful. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, noted that RTD does get some cigarette tax
as a result of sales tax parity. Any further taxes would require
a vote of the people.
Director Menten mentioned that the original intent of the Fare
Task Force was to simplify the system but it sounds like it is
evolving into evaluation of fares. General Manager
Washington said the main objective is simplification of fare
structure with the possibility of other ideas coming out of the
study.
Committee Chair Walker asked staff if any of the deferred
projects would lead to a greater expense in the future.
Jannette Scarpino answered that senior staff agreed there are
no other repercussions beyond the normal rise in cost due to
annual inflation.

General Manager Washington informed the Directors that he had just
received word via text message that President Obama was visiting Denver
Union Station (DUS) and The Crawford Hotel. All RTD operations at DUS
have been temporarily suspended.

C. Updates

Terry Howerter introduced Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting,
who presented the May Monthly Financial Status Report starting on page
147 of the July 8, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring/Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Meeting Packet. Overall there was a decrease in Ridership
and Fare Revenue but an increase in Sales & Use Tax. Doug MacLeod
pointed out that the monthly report usually compares current numbers to
this date’s last year numbers. The May, 2014 report compares current
numbers with the budgeted numbers because that gives a better indication
of where RTD is at compared to where we plan to be.
Director Bagley thanked Doug MacLeod for adding the “actual” line item in
comparison to the “budgeted” line item on the updated report.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Washington informed the Directors that President Obama has left
DUS. The station is open again. The bus and light rail network is catching up to its
schedules.

Manager Washington noted the items that had passed by unanimous consent and the ones
that passed by recommended action. Chair Sisk commended General Manager
Washington for a great presentation on the SE corridor. He noted we will be looking for

General Manager Washington responded that the staff is passionate about obtaining
funding for all corridors and will jump when the opportunity presents itself. He
anticipates a large public participation at the July 15 meeting.

Other Matters

meeting notice was required. He shared that he is committed to openness and
transparency and is aware of the open meetings requirements; therefore he will always
follow the procedure for posting and noticing meetings within 24 hours of the meeting
time.

Director Bagley stated that he assumes this discussion had to do with TOD. He
indicated he was not in favor of anyone having a discussion about TOD’s especially in
someone else’s district when that Director is not present. Chair Sisk responded that
any meeting with two or more Board members will be public and open but that he is
concerned about trying to limit the conversation in a one-on one matter. This puts
everyone and the freedom of speech at risk. Director Bagley indicated he would be
concerned that allegations could be made that the Director would not have a chance to
defend.

enjoys traveling and just came back from Great Britain.
Joe shared how impressed he is with the RTD program and that it has come a long way.
He can see the impact RTD is making to the building of the metro area. He is excited

Public Participation
Chair Sisk opened the meeting up for public participation and asked each speaker to please
state his or her name and address. They have a time limit of 3 minutes. He recognized
first a couple of elected officials as speakers.
 Joseph Cirelli, Mayor Pro-tem for Superior, indicated he was representing the US 36
Mayors and Coalition Solutions. He stated they support the NAMS Consensus
Statement. They have been working to improve transportation in the northwest
corridor. The NAMS Study was a valuable stakeholder process. The Resolution
details RTD support and how we will work together in the short, medium and long
term. They are looking forward to resolution of some of the bi-directional issues.
They are grateful for RTD’s support of the US Tiger Planning Grant. The
recommended arterial BRT does not use FasTracks funds. While they are
disappointed that Northwest Rail may not occur until 2042, they are ready to move
forward on the recommendations from the NAMS Study.
 Jennine Jeffries, Englewood, spoke as a single mother of four. She is an advocate
for affordable transit. Right now, she has to spend $4.00 each way for transit or
$32 per day for her family. We really need a sliding scale or income based pricing.

employees who placed in the competition. He then turned it over to Mike Gil to do the
honors.

She is currently fighting for self-sufficiency and affordable public transportation is
needed.
Zoë Williams, Englewood, representing 9-to-5, shared a story from someone living
in Director Tobiassen’s district. She shared that Mekala is a 27-year-old
undocumented worker making minimum wages who works two jobs in the janitorial
service. She cannot afford the bus and often has to walk at least 5 miles to get to
work. Because she is an undocumented worker, she cannot access any of the
services for discounted fares and is sometimes taken advantage of by her
employers. Making public transportation affordable needs to be a priority of the
fare task force.
Gina McAfee, Ex member of the US 36 Commuting Solutions Board of Directors,
expressed the need for mobility for the US 36 corridor. She appreciates that RTD is
working with this corridor on multimodal solutions. She wants to offer her support
for the approval of the NAMS Consensus Statement. She commended the staff for
their patience and diligence. This Resolution represents a concerted effort of the
US 36 corridor to include BRT as a natural model. We need to move forward with
the advancement of BRT while committing to Northwest Rail as a long-term
commitment. They understand the challenges of increased rail construction costs.
Scott Kerr, Denver, indicated he is Director of the Homeless Services for Bayaud
Enterprises. He shared they spend about $45K of their annual budget to purchase
bus passes. Many of the users of their service need bus passes and what they can
offer is a very small component of the actual need. They may give out a couple of
passes when the person may need passes for the full month in order to seek jobs
and other opportunities where they can become self-sufficient. As indicated a
number of people needing affordable tickets are undocumented workers. We need
to find a way to provide affordable public transportation for low-income people who
ride public transportation.
Thomas Trujillo challenges the City and County to make transportation more
affordable. We need more income based pricing for bus fare. This needs to be a
win-win situation. RTD needs riders to fill the seats and low-income needs
affordable fares so they can get to work and where they need to go.
Charles Sharrock, Aurora, stated that he has two ideas. The first has to do with
trash around bus stops and finding a way to engage the people to keep the bus
stop areas clean. The second idea is one that he has been working on for a number
of years. He provided a sketch of this idea for their consideration.
Mayor Pat Quinn, Broomfield, CFO of Loja group, and member of the US 36
Commuting Solutions, complimented General Manager Washington and his staff on
the progress that is being made. He indicated we need to continue to focus on the
long-term viability of the City. He supports the recommendations from the NAMS
Study but indicated BRT is a short-term solution. As such we need to make sure it

kicks ass-Wi-Fi, real time information, etc. and a fulfillment of these promises. We
need viable and affordable solutions.
Laura Cerros, Adams County, spoke to the Board with an interpreter. She shared
she is a mom living in Adams County who uses public transportation to take her
kids to school and other activities. This is quite expensive. Where they have to
cross there is lots of traffic and sometimes it is difficult to cross the street; there is
no shelter or protection from the elements; there are no signs leading to the bus
stop. She is here advocating for affordable transportation such as family bus
passes.

Chair Sisk shared that in addition to the public speakers, the Board had received letters in
support of NAMS from Will Toor and Bruce Benson, University of Colorado.

Director Menten inquired about what were some of the things that RTD escalated
to make sure the DUS facility was ready for the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) gala
event. General Manager Washington responded RTD had worked with the vendor
Kiewit, to complete some of the outstanding items, to make sure the Plaza was
ready and to turn on the water fountain on the Plaza. RTD had also sent extra
buses along the 16 Street Mall to transport the participants to the DUS facility.
Director Bagley shared information from his Montreal rail conference. Three areas
that he noted:
o State of Good Repair—The issue of total asset management as a result of
MAP-21 requirements will become elevated from a national perspective in
2016. RTD is already ahead of the curve when it comes to our work on
state of good repair.
o TOD-the role that transit is doing to affect TOD development around stations
is important.
o Community Economic Development—The impact of DUS on economic
development is huge. He had shared information on the RIF and TIFIA loan
component of this financing.
o He had an opportunity to speak with Gary Thomas, CEO of DART, one of
the agencies that are participating in the MAX program, about development
around the DUS station. Gary shared that he had brought one of his
prominent developers to Denver to tour the facility and that General Manager
Washington had shared information with them about this development
effort.

Award of “Group 25” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group
25” contracted fixed-route transit services with Veolia Transportation. This contract is for three
years for an amount not to exceed $66,874,659 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of
$24,271,326 (option year 1) and $25,140,353 (option year 2), for a total five year not-to-exceed
amount of $116,286,338. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an
amount estimated to be approximately $13,799,677 for the initial three year contract term,
$4,816,129 for option year 1, and $4,929,152 for option year 2, for a total of $23,544,958 for the
five year period. This results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $80,674,336 for the initial
three year contract period and $139,831,296 for the five year period. This proposal represents the
most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14DH-021, to provide “Group 25” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service
is scheduled to be effective on January 4, 2015.
BACKGROUND:
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
RTD privatizes a portion of its fixed route bus service.
Originally mandated by Senate Bill 88-164 revised in 1999 under HB99-1030, revised in 2003 under
HB03-1103, and revised in 2007 under SB07-251, RTD “may implement a system under which up to
fifty-eight percent (58%) of the District’s vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses
pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts.”
In April of 2014, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to
provide contracted fixed-route transit services, referred to as “Group 25”. The Group 25 service
package represents the re-bid of service currently operated by Veolia Transportation under Contract
Group 21, and includes local and express service in the Denver metro area. The RFP was mailed to
13 firms who indicated an interest in proposing on opportunities to provide contracted fixed-route
services. Proposals were due on May 19, 2014.
The Group 25 service offering consists of 107 buses operating 29 routes providing approximately
332,000 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in Group 25 is included as
Attachment A. The entire Group 25 service package is currently operated by Veolia Transportation.
Implementation of Group 25 service is scheduled to be effective January 4, 2015. The award of
“Group 25” service to Veolia Transportation as recommended, will maintain RTD’s current status of
providing approximately 57% of RTD vehicular service by private contractor.
DISCUSSION:

Packet Pg. 84

11.A

Three (3) proposals were received in response to RFP 14-DH-021 for the Provision of Group 25
Public Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, MV Transportation and
Veolia Transportation.
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in
response to RFP 14-DH-021, that RTD award a contract for Group 25 fixed route transit service to
Veolia Transportation. Veolia Transportation was the highest ranked proposal for both the technical
response and the SBE plan/goal attainment.
The Veolia Transportation five-year cost was
$1,101,189 less than the highest bid and $232,530 higher than the lowest bid (See Group 25 Proposer Cost Summary below).
The recommendation for contract award is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to
the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established
for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b)
experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal
attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Steve Gieske,
Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Alice Osner, General Superintendent,
Transportation; Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Greg Smith, Manager,
Competitive Services; and Derrick Wojcik-Damers, Senior Technician, Contracted Services. The SBE
plan and goal attainment evaluation team consisted of Zamy Silva, Manager, SBO; and Amanda
Murray, Civil Rights Specialist.
Proposal Review – The members of the technical evaluation team individually reviewed the technical
proposals submitted by the three proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals and
assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for “Experience and Qualifications.” Based
on the average of the individual scores received in these categories, Veolia Transportation was the
highest rated technical proposal followed by MV Transportation and First Transit. The SBE team
individually reviewed the SBE plan and proposed goal attainment documents and assigned a score for
the “SBE Plan and Goal Attainment” for each proposal. This score was added to the technical
evaluation scores. Veolia was again ranked the highest in SBE goal attainment (Veolia was the only
proposer that exceeded the SBE goal). The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was
calculated by the RTD procurement staff. The cost score was then added to the technical score and
SBE score of each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. Veolia
Transportation had the highest overall rated proposal (89 out of 100) followed by MV Transportation
(85 out of 100) and First Transit (81 out of 100). Even though Veolia Transportation scored the
highest overall in the selection process, their cost proposal was above the RTD internal cost estimate
and as a result the selection committee elected to move forward with oral presentations.
Oral Presentations – Veolia Transportation was asked to provide further detail on previous
management team turnover and to elaborate on the components of their cost proposal. MV
Transportation and First Transit were both asked to provide further detail on their proposed facility
(coincidently both proposed the same location), their proposed management team, their SBE plan and
their recruitment plan. The proposers were asked to submit a best and final offer (BAFO). Upon
review of the revised price proposals and additional information provided it was determined that
Veolia Transportation provided the most responsive and responsible proposal for the Group 25
service followed by First Transit and then MV Transportation.

Packet Pg. 85

11.A

The final ranking represents the evaluation team’s conclusion that the strengths of the Veolia
Transportation technical and SBE proposal outweighed the strengths of the MV Transportation and
First Transit proposals and more than offset the slight difference in cost.

A key strength of the Veolia Transportation proposal was the proposed management team. Under
this team’s leadership, the Veolia division consistently meets/exceeds many of the RTD quarterly
performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive relationships with
Denver metropolitan area governments and communities. The team is experienced in providing
service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and, consequently, no disruption of service
when transitioning from the “Group 21” contract to the new “Group 25” contract. Veolia
Transportation proposed very detailed maintenance, operations and safety/training plans; and an
increase in operator wages. They will also be adding a dedicated Customer Service Representative
to help further address customer complaints and a SBE Compliance Specialist to maintain positive
working relationships with their SBE partners. Veolia’s initial effort to identify and engage SBE
vendors has allowed Veolia to already exceed the contract SBE goal.
The strengths of the MV Transportation proposal included experience with “Maximus” maintenance
reporting software and a detailed start-up plan, but the MV Transportation proposal was determined
to be weak in the areas of facility location and plan; and the proposed management team did not
have recent/relevant experience with a transit bus property similar in scope, size, and complexity.
The strengths of the First Transit proposal included a strong management team, but the First Transit
proposal was determined to be weak in the area of their facility location and plan and their final cost
proposal was the highest of the three proposals.
Veolia Transportation provides voluntary medical, dental, vision, and life insurance for employees.
Veolia Transportation pays 85% of the cost of the premium for medical insurance (regardless of the
benefit level) and provides voluntary flexible spending and dependent care flexible spending
accounts. Veolia Transportation pays 100% of the cost for basic life insurance coverage for each
full-time employee, and provides an Employee Assistance Program at no cost. Additionally, tuition
reimbursement is available, along with options for supplemental life, spousal life, and child life
insurance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Veolia Transportation’s proposed first year price for “Group 25” is 8.2% lower than the current
contract price of the “Group 21” contract that it replaces. Veolia Transportation’s proposed hourly
rates for the five-year period of the proposed contract range from $64.50 (contract year 1) to
$72.75 (contract year 5). The hourly rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from
$62.10-$65.73 (current contract year) to $62.15-$65.73 (contract year 5). The total five-year
proposed price represents a $28.5 million savings over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the
service.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the

Packet Pg. 86

11.A

District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the Group 25 service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for Veolia Transportation’s provision of the services is included in Veolia Transportation’s Direct
Service Cost as shown in Attachment B.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract will be included in the adopted
2015 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to Veolia Transportation, as recommended
2)
Award the contract to the second ranked proposer (First Transit) or the third ranked
proposer (MV Transportation). This is not recommended as it does not reflect the
outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 25 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 2, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

Approval of Construction Contract for the
Central Park Station PnR & Bus Transfer Center

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a construction contract
with M.A. Mortenson Company in the amount of $10,899,258.23 for the construction of the Central
Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus Transfer Center, which will serve the East Rail Line Central Park
Station, regional and local buses and the local neighborhood. Funding for this project is included in the
2014 Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project for the Stapleton
Park-n-Ride replacement.
BACKGROUND
This action supports the General Manager’s Task Goal to “Continue advancement of FasTracks,”
because this project will enhance multi-modal commuter connectivity to the East Rail Line train, regional
and local buses, bicycle access and vehicle parking with an RTD owned Park-n-Ride (PnR).
When DIA opened in 1995 and Stapleton International Airport (SIA) closed, RTD began operating a Bus
Transfer Center and PnR at the previous SIA parking area. Both surface and covered parking were
provided through a license agreement between RTD and the City & County of Denver. During August
2010, the Stapleton PnR was relocated to an interim asphaltic-gravel surface lot located near East 36th
Ave. & Central Park Blvd. The site provides surface parking for approximately1500 spaces. Bus service
for eleven (11) routes is near the PnR on E. 36th Ave. between Ulster and Central Park Blvd.
During 2001, RTD received a CMAQ grant to acquire property and complete an environmental clearance
for the proposed relocation of the SIA PnR/Bus Transfer Center. Environmental clearances were initiated
for the new permanent site on Smith Rd. just west of Central Park Blvd. Several concept designs were
prepared and coordinated with the City and County of Denver and Stapleton neighborhood developer.
In July 2010, RTD signed an IGA with Park Creek Metro District (PCMD) and Forest City Stapleton, Inc.
for acquisition, design and construction of public infrastructure capital improvements. Approximately
50% of the identified PnR site was acquired in late 2011. In the spring of 2012, a finding of “no further
action” was received for the environmental cleanup. RTD then acquired the remaining property in July,
2012, for the balance of needed property (approximately 20 acres). The PnR will be located on three
individual blocks that are separated by public Right-of-way. RTD and PCMD amended the IGA three
times as follows:
1. Early traffic signal and intersection design at Smith Rd. & Ulster St. for EAGLE PUC applications;
2. Implement final design of public infrastructure improvements such as utilities and access roads;
3. Construction funding of the public infrastructure that is adjacent to RTD’s new PnR site.

Packet Pg. 93

11.B

RTD has participated in a number of public outreach meetings and provided extensive coordination with
affected stakeholders including the City and County of Denver, the Park Creek Metro District, Stapleton
United Neighbors community, and Forrest City Stapleton.
DISCUSSION
The project is shown on the attached presentation. It is located on three individual blocks, bound by
Smith Road on the north, 37 th Place on the south, Central Park Blvd. on the east and Trenton St.
(Walmart) on the west. The project will provide connectivity to the East Rail Line’s Central Park Station
and includes 1500 surface parking spaces and a 12 bus bay transfer facility. The parking area includes
ADA parking, motorcycle parking, and Kiss-n-Ride parking. The 12 bus bay transfer facility will have 4
bus passenger loading/unloading platforms, each with 3 gates, and overhead canopies which represents
the “Industrial Loft” architecture style of the commuter rail station. The design features include site
lighting, wind screens with functional art showing local native species, benches, trash receptacles,
passenger way finding and information displays, bike racks and lockers.
The bus transfer facility will also provide room for RTD Access-a-Ride vehicles, private hotel shuttles,
and will also include drivers relief stations. The project is designed with sustainable measures such as
low water landscaping, snow infiltration basins, and high efficiency LED lighting. In addition, the site
will accept a solar photovoltaic array in the future if or when funding becomes available. Safety &
security elements are incorporated in the project with the placement of emergency telephones, with
security camera and the underground infrastructure to easily allow for placement of approximately 100
security and parking management surveillance cameras throughout the PnR. The site will satisfy all ADA
accessibility and parking requirements.
With approval of this award recommendation, construction is anticipated to begin during August 2014
and a contract milestone to complete the bus transfer center and two of the three parking lots (842
spaces) has been established for July 15, 2015. A second milestone of Oct. 31, 2015 requires
completion of the third, west most, parking lot (658 spaces). The construction IFB was released on May
21, 2014 and included a Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 27%. This recommended
contract has proposed a 31.93% DBE value. On June 19, 2014 RTD received and opened two (2) bids,
as shown below:
1. Mortenson
2. Krische

$10,899,258.23
$12,151,021.43

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the nonFasTracks capital project for the Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement. The funding is allocated as follows:
Eagle Project
Non-FasTracks Capital
Total

$6,222,574.09
$4,676,684.14
$10,899,258.23

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into a construction contract with M.A. Mortenson Company in the amount of
$10,899,258.23 for the construction of the Central Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus Transfer
Center, which will serve the East Rail Line Central Park Station, regional and local buses and the

local neighborhood. Funding for this project is included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the
Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project for the Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not construct the Central Park Station PnR. This
is not recommended as this PnR is providing a substantial parking component for the East Rail
Line and also provides a major passenger transfer facility for our current base system bus routes.
This would jeopardize the continued use of the interim parking lot, which is available by lease to
RTD only until the end of August 2015.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because the
construction costs are anticipated to increase as the overall economy continues to improve.
Delays would jeopardize the current bid, which is valid for only 60 days after its opening. Also,
delaying this action may create a timing issue for the existing PnR and bus transfer facility that is
operating on leased property that is currently scheduled to terminate at the end August 2015.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 26, 2014

From:

William C. Van Meter, Assistant General
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

June 20, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119

Resolution 2014-7
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in
early 2015 which specifies the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) project.
BACKGROUND
This action fits within the General Manager’s 2014 Goals of Innovative and fiscally sustainable
service delivery and Grow ridership and engage customers across the region as implementation of
the SH 119 BRT project will increase the service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the
service.
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. The highest consensus priority for arterial BRT, as
described in the NAMS Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning,
environmental clearance and preliminary engineering to establish BRT in the SH 119 Corridor from
Longmont to Boulder. Staff submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Reco very
(TIGER) Planning Grant on April 28, 2014, to pursue these advanced planning activities. As part of
the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, Boulder County, using the results of RTD’s
NAMS analyses, has submitted the SH 119 Corridor for consideration by DRCOG for inclusion in the
2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). DRCOG’s RTP scoring criteria indicate that the project is
eligible for inclusion in the fiscally-constrained RTP and would be eligible for future federal funding
participation through the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program. Inclusion of the corridor in
the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA) clearance can be completed.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013 dollars
and $75 million in Year of Expenditure dollars (2021-2024).
DISCUSSION
SB 208 grants DRCOG the statutory authority to review and approve the technology and method of
financing for RTD fixed-guideway projects. Should RTD pursue BRT in this corridor, as prioritized by
the NAMS Final Consensus Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to SB 208
approval. Discussions with DRCOG staff have indicated that RTD could submit the SB 208 report in

Packet Pg. 111

12.C

early 2015. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for BRT in the corridor would be as
follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) funds through the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) funds and/or Surface
Transportation Program (STP)-Metro funds.

Based on current financial projections, project construction is expected to occur within the 2021 to
2024 timeframe. However, recognizing the effectiveness of this project and local stakeholder
support, RTD intends to pursue opportunities to accelerate project planning, environmental and
design work and to explore financing options to accelerate the project completion date. Future Board
action would be required to approve advancing BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact directly related to this action; however, should the Board at a later date, and
after further study, opt to move forward with implementation of this project, there will be a financial
impact to the District. Current DRCOG projections for the fiscally-constrained 2040 RTP indicate the
project will be eligible for federal funding support through the TIP in the 2015-2024 timeframe as
described above. The cost of the corridor is projected to be $57 million in 2013 dollars and $75 million
in Year of Expenditure dollars (2021-2024), with the expectation that 50 percent of the project’s
funding would come from DRCOG TIP sources and 50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and future
Board action would be required to advance implementation of this BRT corridor.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will
permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in early 2015 which specifies the
technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
would permit staff to submit to DRCOG, when appropriate, an SB 208 Report which specifies
the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 BRT project.

208 ( C. R.S. 32- 9- 107. 7) AND DIRECTING STAFF TO SUBMIT PROJECT FOR
CONSIDERATION TO THE DENVER REGIONAL COUNCIL OF
GOVERNMENTS

Whereas, RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study ( NAMS), in April 2013. The
purpose of the study was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of
Transportation ( CDOT) and the Northwest- area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and
businesses, on cost effective and efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area;
Whereas, on June 24, 2014, the RTD Board approved a resolution which accepted the

Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders for priorities within the
Northwest Study Area;
Whereas, one of the highest priorities, as described in the Final Consensus Statement,

was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and preliminary engineering to
establish Bus Rapid Transit( BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont to Boulder;

Whereas, RTD has submitted a Transportation Investment Generating Economic
Recovery ( TIGER) grant to pursue advanced planning for BRT in the SH 119 Corridor;
Whereas, Boulder County, using the results of RTD' s NAMS analysis, has submitted the
SH 119 BRT corridor for consideration and inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan
RTP) process;

Whereas, inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental

Planning Act( NEPA) clearance can be completed;
Whereas, the cost to establish BRT is estimated to be approximately $ 57 million in 2013
dollars and $ 75 million in Year of Expenditure dollars and the expectation is that,
implementation of the 514 119 BRT Corridor would occur in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, if not
sooner;

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 2, 2014

From:

William C. Van Meter, Assistant General
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

July 1, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

Approval to submit the RTD FasTracks
Projects for the DRCOG 2040 Regional
Transportation Plan (Baseline Report)

Resolution 2014-8
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve
the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline
Report on FasTracks in conformance with DRCOG’s request for ongoing review of the FasTracks
Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18, 2013.
FasTracks projects and project elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report,
will be included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently being prepared by DRCOG.
BACKGROUND
This action supports and fulfills the General Manager Goals of Innovative, priority-based
FasTracks/SBP Funding because it capitalizes on available, project-specific funding sources to further
the build-out of FasTracks; and Continue Advancement of FasTracks because it moves RTD further
toward completion of the full FasTracks Plan.
In 1990, the Colorado Legislature approved C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 (SB 208), which requires that
DRCOG, as the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), approve the technology and the method
of financing for all RTD fixed guideway projects. Therefore, SB 208 applies to FasTracks and RTD
has submitted reports on FasTracks to DRCOG since 2004. In September 18, 2013, the DRCOG
Board passed a resolution requesting submittal of a Baseline Report on FasTracks by August 1,
2014. FasTracks projects that will be completed by 2040, as described in the Baseline Report, will
be included in the 2040 RTP that is currently being prepared by DRCOG. Inclusion in the RTP is
necessary for environmental clearance through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and to
be eligible for receipt of Federal funding.
The Baseline Report will include a discussion of the following items:
 Project Definition/Scope (Project Description)
 Financial Plan (Costs and Revenue)
 Schedule
 Operating Characteristics
 Level of Bus Service
In May 2014, the RTD Board of Directors approved the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE),
which included a comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed,

Packet Pg. 118

12.D

underway, or planned through the year 2019. The Baseline Report will include a status report of all
FasTracks projects based on a completion schedule by 2040, rather than 2019; however, the only
change from the 2014 APE is in regard to the acceleration of the Southeast Rail Extension funding
and schedule, based on current financial assumptions, which include receipt of a Full Funding Grant
Agreement (FFGA) from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for the Southeast Rail Extension
and local funding contributions.
DISCUSSION
The RTD Board, in August 2012, approved an amendment to the 2035 RTP, which describes the
intent to apply for Federal New Starts funding to complete the Southeast Rail Extension. This was
followed by RTD submittal of an application to enter the FTA New Starts process and a re quest for
$92 million. RTD was granted entry into Project Development in April 2013 and a second submittal
(request to enter Engineering) is due to FTA in September 2014. It is necessary to include the
Southeast Rail Extension project in the 2040 RTP via the Baseline Report to DRCOG due August 1,
2014, in order to be eligible to make application to enter the Engineering phase of the New Starts
process and maintain eligibility to receive the requested $92 million. While the Southeast Rail
Extension Project is currently in the 2035 RTP, it is scheduled for completion in the 2030 – 2035
timeframe. The timeframe for project completion will be revised to 2015 – 2024 in the 2040 RTP,
pursuant to Board approval of this action. Any contract for Engineering work on the Project will be
submitted to the RTD Board for approval.
On June 13, 2014, RTD received a letter from public and private Southeast corridor stakeholders
signed by the City of Lone Tree, Coventry Development, Douglas County, and the Southeast Public
Improvement Metropolitan District, pledging a sizable commitment of $25 million in cash, and up to
$15 million in right-of-way (ROW), permits, and other in-kind contributions to complete the
Southeast Extension. This letter is attached. Below is an accounting of the anticipated project costs
and funding commitments based on the amount requested in Federal funds and the local
commitment.

FFGA funds are unrelated to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Therefore, current challenges faced by the HTF
have no direct impact on Southeast Rail Extension New Starts eligibility or funding stream.

CMAQ = $7.5 Million in Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Funds (CMAQ) represents the
Southeast Rail Extension allocation of the DRCOG $60 Million Commitment in Principle to all FasTracks
projects.

Local Stakeholder contributions could be as high as $15 Million. The ROW component, which is calculated for
Federal purposes, is $9.2 Million.

Packet Pg. 119

12.D

Revising the Southeast Rail Extension schedule in the RTP positions RTD to leverage both Federal
and Local Stakeholder dollars to complete a component of the FasTracks Program. This is consistent
with our guiding principles, which include maximizing outside funding sources to complete
FasTracks. As noted above, the RTD contribution would be 35.5% of the cost to complete the
project, while the Federal and Local Stakeholder contribution equals 64.5%. The Local Stakeholder
contribution of 16.5% of project costs far exceeds the 2.5% required local match, and represents
the largest local commitment, by percentage of project costs, made to any FasTracks corridor.
Note that this action is a precursor to construction and that additional Board action, such as
approval of a construction contract, will be necessary prior to construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project would be provided through a combination of federal grants, local stakeholder
contributions, and previous and future commitments of RTD FasTracks funds. A separate Board action
would be required to authorize the additional $65.6 million in project funds that have not been
committed from other sources.
The inclusion of the Southeast Rail Extension in the Baseline Report will not affect the planned
financing or construction schedule for other FasTracks projects. The federal FFGA funding and local
stakeholder contributions are not available for RTD to use on any other FasTracks corridors.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to
submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on FasTracks in conformance with
DRCOG’s request for ongoing review of the FasTracks Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as
outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and project
elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report, will be included in the
2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently being prepared by DRCOG.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the attached resolution, which
would permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on FasTracks
in conformance with SB 208 and as outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18,
2013; would leverage Federal funds and local dollars; would utilize a 16.5% match from the
local stakeholders; and would further the completion of the FasTracks Program.

RESOLUTION No. ____
SERIES OF 2014
APPROVAL TO SUBMIT THE RTD BASELINE REPORT TO DRCOG ON
FASTRACKS
Whereas, in 1990, the Colorado Legislature passed C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 that provides for the
approval by the metropolitan planning organization, the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG), of the method of financing and technology for any component part or corridor of a regional
fixed guideway mass transit system.
Whereas, to assure conformity with any changes in the FasTracks plan since DRCOG gave its
approval for those elements in 2004, DRCOG, on September 18, 2013, resolved to request submittal of an
RTD Baseline Report to document the status of the FasTracks Plan.
Whereas, projects and project elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in the RTD
Baseline Report, will be included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and thus will be
included in studies to confirm regional air quality conformity, which is necessary for receipt of National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) approval and eligibility for available Federal funding.
Whereas, the RTD Baseline Report includes information on the project definition/scope (project
description including the technology), financial plan (costs and revenue and method of financing),
schedule, operating characteristics, and level of bus service, which will document the status of the
FasTracks Plan.
Whereas, the Baseline Report is documentation of progress made and current status as a result of
previous RTD Board of Director decisions, with the exception of the schedule for completion of the
Southeast Rail Extension, which is revised to open in 2019. Correspondingly, the change in financial plan
from assumptions made prior to 2012 now assumes the receipt of a Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in the amount of $92 Million and Local Stakeholder contribution
of $34.2 Million. With $207.4 Million required to complete the project, the additional RTD commitment
is $65.6 Million, or 35.5% of the costs to complete the Southeast Rail Extension Project.
Whereas, adjusting the Southeast Rail Extension schedule and its inclusion in the RTP is
necessary to maintain eligibility for the Federal funds requested and to be able to utilize the Local
Stakeholder contribution, which will facilitate construction of the Southeast Rail Extension Project and
move forward the completion of the FasTracks Plan, a regional transit system.
Whereas, future Board action will be required prior to the construction of the Southeast Rail
Extension Project.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that:
The RTD Board of Directors will permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, an RTD
Baseline Report on FasTracks in conformance with C.R.S. 32-9-107.7according to the DRCOG
Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and project elements that will be completed by
2040, as described in this report, will be included in the 2040 RTP.

A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE ACCELERATED CONSTRUCTION
OF

SOUTHEAST

LIGHT

RAIL

EXTENSION

BY

THE

REGIONAL

TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

WHEREAS, voters in 2004 approved a Regional Transportation District ( RTD)
FasTracks ballot measure that authorized RTD to increase its sales tax rate and issue debt to
construct and operate a fixed guideway mass transit system, as specified in the RTD 2004 Transit

Expansion Plan that included the extension of the Southeast Rail Line to RidgeGate Parkway,
titled there " Southeast Corridor Enhancements" and now a 2. 2- mile extension of the existing
Southeast Rail line from Lincoln to RidgeGate Parkway known as the " Southeast Light Rail
Extension" that will add three new stations to complete the line; and

WHEREAS, the Southeast Light Rail Extension will increase parking capacity at RTD
end- of-line stations near the Town of Parker and will bring light rail stations and service closer to

Town of Parker residents than it is currently, allowing them increased commuting options and a
variety of ways to travel throughout the region to work, recreation, and for other purposes; and

WHEREAS, through the Federal Transit Administration' s New Starts grant process,

RTD has confirmed that this project could be completed by 2019, and without that funding, RTD
predicts the line would be completed sixteen years later in 2035; and

WHEREAS, an estimated 20, 000 new jobs, 4, 000 new residences, 10 million square feet

of commercial development, and $ 700 million increase in assessed valuation in the surrounding
Southeast region are predicted to be generated by the accelerated construction of this line.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN
OF PARKER, COLORADO, AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1.

The Council supports the accelerated construction of the Southeast Light

Rail Extension by the Regional Transportation District through the competitive Federal Transit
Administration New Starts grant process, and supports its inclusion in all relevant RTD and

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 2, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

July 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014

Subject:

2015 - 2020 Strategic Budget Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.

Fiscal

Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update annually
a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District. The
other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time period.
These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have adequate
resources to meet cash flow needs.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits, and
to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to operate within the
forecast of revenues available for their completion and operation.
The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2015-2020 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2015-2020 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.

DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2014 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best
estimates at this time. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
on July 8th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on July 15 th.

Packet Pg. 142

12.E

Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2015-2020 projected cash flow through the extension of
the 2014 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Amended Budget 2014” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, and reductions, eliminations or
deferrals of SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this
period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2015-2020 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $119.3 million in 2015 is forecast to remain flat from 2014 due to no
expected growth in ridership. The SBP assumes zero ridership increase through 2020.
In future years, fare revenue includes a 10% fare rate increase in 2016 and 2019 per
Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years. No fare rate
increases have occurred since 2011. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the June quarterly update from the CU-Leeds School of
Business for the years 2014-2020. (Line 2)
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and recent
congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price Index (CPI)
(obtained from the Colorado Legislative Council) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Operating expense:
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates of 2.5% in 2015-2020. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, Denver Union Station, and the Free MetroRide are
allocated from Base to FasTracks, and thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 then escalated at the CPI rate for 2018-2020. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.12/gallon, which is the 2014 lock price, and then
escalated at the national CPI rate of 2.1% in 2015-2020. Gasoline is budgeted at
$3.54/gallon, which is the same as used in the 2014 Amended Budget, and then
escalated at the national CPI rate of 2.1% in 2015-2020. (Line 11)
 Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense projects”)
are included. This is detailed in Exhibit III. (Line 12)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System, is
increased by the CPI rate serially each year beginning in 2014. (Line 14)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and a forecasted rise in interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 17)
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year
(both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Projected
interest payments on future debt issues use current municipal interest rate forward curves
incorporated in debt amortization schedules. (Line 18)
 Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects and
replacements. This is detailed in Exhibit II. (Line 21)

Packet Pg. 143

12.E

 Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund,
staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and/or capital replacement
fund be maintained at a minimum $3.0 million each year until each fund reaches the
minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur no later than 2019. (Lines 23,
24, 33, and 34)
 Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in accordance
with fleet schedules. (Line 26)
 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (both current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. (Line
27)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted yearend fund balance. During 2018, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to
reach if not exceed $30 million. (Line 32)
Note: The CLC inflation rate (CPI) is 2.5% 2015-2020, while the national CPI (applied to fuel) is 2.1%
in 2015-2020.

Exhibit II
Exhibit II attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned capital projects during the
SBP period.
Exhibit III
Exhibit III attached to this document is a detailed listing of planned operating, maintenance and
administrative projects during the SBP period.
Exhibit IV
Exhibit IV attached to this document is a listing of capital and operating projects deferred from
2015 that were submitted for consideration during the SBP development process. The SBP
was balanced largely by deferral to 2016-2018 of several projects requested for 2015. In
2016-2018, the SBP generates sufficient cash flow to support these 2015 deferred projects.
Exhibit V
Exhibit V attached to this document is a chart of capital projects by type for the current and
last three SBP periods.
Exhibit VI
Exhibit VI attached to this document is a chart of operating and maintenance projects by type
for the current and last three SBP periods.
The 2015-2020 SBP planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI
rate starting in 2015:

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior

Packet Pg. 144

12.E

to final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI
impacts are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements
(repairs, replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be
provided and a statement from the Planning Department is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax
revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an
impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2015
budget period.
Current key financial indicators for the SBP are:

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2015-2020 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by staff
and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2015-2020 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the SBP
identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2015 budget process
and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2015
Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2015-2020 SBP.
This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible delay in the
2015 budget process.

Per the U.S. Department of Transportation guidance and regulations, all recipients
of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1 964 and its related laws and regulations. As a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) submits an annual assurance
of compliance with Title VI as a part of RTD’s annual submission of Certifications
and Assurances, as required per 49 CFR part 21.7. Accordingly, RTD’s Planning
Department will review the district’s services in its entirety for compliance with
Title VI. This review will include a review of the Strategic Budget Plan as
necessary, pursuant to ensuring non-discrimination on basis of race, color and
national origin. Should any Title VI violations become evident, remedial and/or
mitigating measures will be developed to restore equity and achieve compliance
with Title VI.

The Bus Shelter Program is created to upgrade RTD’s current shelter
construction with an updated standard product. RTD’s engineering staff
has created a conceptual design that considers lessons learned over the
past fifteen years, and which incorporates good materials that are durable
and easy to maintain. The conceptual design has been favorably checked
for vulnerability and ease of maintenance by colleagues from the Safety,
Security & Facilities Department, and has also been satisfactorily assessed
by a manufacturer for constructability. The project’s intent is to solicit final
design and construction proposals by manufacturers and installers.

Requesting a vehicle to be used as a response/installation/maintenance
vehicle for fiber optic backbone work. This vehicle needs to have a modular
type box (i.e., ambulance type) to be used as a clean work area for the
fiber work. A clean area is needed so that outside contaminants are kept
out of the fiber splicing area. The modular unit should be equipped with a
generator or DC/AC inverter so that 110VAC is available in the back for the
fiber splicing equipment. Also, the unit should should be climate controlled
so that the operation of fiber repair can be optimally performed. Also, the
vehicle needs to have railroad hi-rail capabilities. Since most of RTD's fiber
backbone is along rail alignments, a vehicle of this type is needed to
access areas where regular road vehicles cannot get to.

Asset Management Program Planning and Implementation
District Shops - Operations Center
Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors
and maintains things of value to an entity or group. IT asset management is
the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making
for the IT environment. This is also one of the processes defined within IT
service management. The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for the current and
future computing size of the District. A more robust integrated system is
needed for hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration control,
and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes the tracking of computers,
servers, software, mobile devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops,

Call-n-Ride Tablet Replacement
District Shops - Operations Center
The Call-n-Ride vehicles are equipped with DLT rugged mobile computer
tablets. These same DLT tablets are used by RideChecker personnel to
gather infield ridership information, being managed by the same group.
Currently, there are a total of 67 mobile tablets in use: 52 Call-n-Ride and
15 RideChecker. In 2013, 20 machines were replaced with the Panasonic
H2 Tablet, leaving 47 needing replacement in 2015, with 15 in dire need.
Even though the tablets are ruggedized, they still have a higher break rate
than a standard PC that resides within an office setting. The total number
of on-shelf inventory needs to increase to accommodate time involved with
break/fix full turnaround. An additional 8 tablets are needed in order to
reduce service interruption that has been an issue for several years. Also,
the unit hardware will be set to a 3 year life cycle. Request is based on
increased unit numbers: 55 Call-n-Ride, and 20 RideChecker for a total of
75 in service and ready inventory tablets.
Client-Level Encryption Software for Portable Devices
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a
way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption doesn't prevent
hacking but it reduces the likelihood that the hacker will be able to read the
data that is encrypted. On all workstations: provide users with an easy to
use solution for encrypting client-side files, where user works with sensitive
data (ex. SPI). For portable workstations (ex. laptops): provide whole disk
encryption. Centrally managed keys will allow users to encrypt data on their
workstations or in files, but allow authorized RTD administrators with the
key to unencrypt/read information on corporate managed devices if
required (ex. for a records request) or in an emergency.

Enterprise Content Management (ECM) + 2 FTE

As RTD continues to grow, so does the complexity of managing records

Enterprise Records and Information department is conducting a
comprehensive assessment in 2014 (4 phase ECM project) of the
organization’s as-is records and informational assets processes. The first
phase of the assessment is to construct a holistic review of the business
needs, review best practices, define risks and probable
organization/cultural changes, and construct the roadmap for moving
forward in the process. Based on the outcome of this study, and with the
approval and support of Senior Leadership, the other phases include
Solution Development, Solution Deployment, and Solution Support. This is
not specifically a software implementation project, although that may be
part of the ultimate solution. It will also require consulting services and
probable addition to RTD staff. Much depends on the outcome of the study
and the direction provided by the Senior Leadership team. Ultimately, our
goal is to implement an enterprise wide ECM and also migrate all records
and key artifacts from legacy systems and shared drives. This must be
done in alignment with RTD’s corporate taxonomy and must follow the
agency’s corporate retention schedule and policies. The migration of
existing records is a big task, but must be completed to align the various
departments into a single tool and ensure centralized governance of RTD’s
record management policies and guidelines.

TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the past 8 years at
RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and limited in its
functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
Fastracks, and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to collect
customer feedback that is not integrated. The recommendation from the
Smart Card Business Process Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD
procure and implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet
the needs of all departments and projects. The first phase (2015) of this
project is to initiate an enterpise-level study to perform a needs analysis,
develop processes and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and future needs of
RTD. The second phase (2016) is to purchase and implement an enterpise
CRM. If the CRM study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding would drop and
be replaced with annual expense and IT would only need to request 1 new
FTE.

RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District
information and computing services. A wide array of departments and
applications use these storage units to store mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a technology
consisting of computer components and recording media used to retain
digital information. It is a core function and fundamental component of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what
manipulates raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but
larger and cheaper options farther away. In computing, a portfolio of
storage products, including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software
are required to run the Enterprise.

system, there will be a significant amount of work required to remodel

such that downstream integrations from TIES are agnostic and less

IT Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that
monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy
violations and produces reports to a management station. An IDS can
detect and distinguish between different types of legitimate or suspicious
network traffic, and flag harmful traffic to administrators. If the software is
prevention enabled (an intrusion prevention system, or IPS), it can block
the harmful traffic before it becomes an issue. In addition, organizations
use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSes) for other
purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting
existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. An
IDPS is a must-have tool for any serious in-depth computer security plan.

For redundancy, the load balancers at RTD are grouped in a pair. RTD
utilizes a common piece of network equipment to spread resource
demands across multiple application instances so that if one instance is
overburdened or fails, there is another instance to handle the load. One
pair of load balancers serve internal applications such as ERP, TIES,
SharePoint and Email, while another pair serves our public applications
such as Trip Planner, rtd-denver.com, and Oracle iModules. Because each
set of applications is supported by two servers, each server in the pair can
be replaced without causing an outage or interruption to the business.

Mobile Device Application Development
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Develop a single customer-facing mobile application (for iOS, Android, and
other mobile devices) that will allow customers to easily access real-time
predictive information, schedule information, rider alert information,
purchase bus/light rail tickets, pay parking fees, as well as other
functionality relevant to RTD riders. Apps will allow RTD to tap into
powerful device functionality, such as geolocation, push notifications, and
offline usage. In order to guarantee a high-quality product that provides
useful, accurate, comprehensive, and controlled RTD information, an RTDowned app needs to be created. Surveys conducted by RTD’s Market
Research Department have determined that customers frequently ask for
apps to communicate pertinent, customized service information. RTD will
look to partner with an experienced mobile apps developer to build the
initial app. Our criteria will be to select a vendor or platform that can
develop a device-agnostic app (compatible across most mobile operating
systems) and that allows RTD to maintain ownership of the app and its
source code (leaving us with the option to bring later-stage development,
enhancements, and maintenance in-house).

North Metro Ductbank to District Shops
District Shops - Operations Center
Currently we have a 48 strand fiber optic cable that runs between District
Shops and DUS. The current alignment passes through a triangle of BNSF
property for which we have a 20 year lease that expires in 2014. We
propose to reroute the mainline NM ductbank that currently passes by
District Shops on its way to 124th. This will provide us a path to DUS that
avoids the BNSF parcel. We will then install a new 144 strand fiber optic
cable between District Shops and DUS. This data link is crucial to our data

Traveler Information System (TIS)/Real-Time Passenger Information
(RTPI) + 2 FTE
Districtwide
With the implementation of the INIT's CAD/AVL system for fixed-route
buses, RTD is able to provide up-to-date predicted arrival information (also
known as real-time passenger information) to riders. Studies completed at
agencies that have implemented real-time information delivery
demonstrate that the delivery of this critical information to riders will
strongly increase overall satisfaction with public transit, decrease wait time,
increase transit trips per week, increase the feeling of safety, and increase
ridership by reducing the feeling of uncertainty that hinders infrequent/nonriders from using transit. In addition, incident and delay information can be
captured and delivered to internal RTD departments for greater efficiency.
Riders who have access to real-time information feel more in control of
their trip and perceive a shorter wait time, leading to an increase in overall
satisfaction. In order to ensure that riders have access to this timesensitive information, real-time information must be disseminated to the
most relevant, reliable, and widely accessible communication channels to
meet the diverse needs our riders. In addition, the information delivered
must be simple, timely, relevant, accurate, easily understood, and targeted.
The exponential increase in mobile internet usage over the last 5 years has
changed the way in which transit agencies deliver real-time information.
Analysts predict that more people will browse the internet on their
mobile/tablet devices than on traditional desktop/laptop computers in 2015
making the delivery of real-time information on mobile devices an essential
part of RTD's communications strategy. A customer panel focus group
conducted in Q1 2014 found that mobile apps are highly desirable for the
majority of RTD customers. An app incorporating real-time information,
push notifications, intelligent trip planning, and personalization or
recognition of returning customer behavior is highly sought after. A realtime information delivery plan will be formulated in 2014. Expenses include
warranty and IT staff to manage and a business owner.

The initial implementation of RTD's enterprise content management system
and web content platform (Oracle WebCenter Sites) is planned in 2014.
Oracle WebCenter Sites will support the development of a new www.rtddenver.com website to enable the Communications Department and other
business users to easily create and manage contextually relevant and
targeted interactive online experiences across web, mobile, and social
channels. The WebCenter product will enable RTD to deliver a compelling
digital experience to customers by deploying and managing sophisticated
and engaging websites across digital channels. This solution automates the
process of managing the web – including business-user content authoring,
delivery of high-scale dynamic sites, content targeting and optimization,
delivering accessible code, user-generated content, social networking
integration, end-user personalization, and mobile content delivery. This
product will provide Marketing with new targeting capabilities to deliver
customized messages to defined audiences to increase engagement and
content syndication. This flexible, scalable online platform will also integrate
easily with other enterprise technologies such as business intelligence,
social relationship management, customer relationship management, and
more. Going forward, the Digital Marketing team will also require 2 FTEs to
implement, support, and build out the product with the newly available
features and tools, manage content, and design/develop the initial set-up
and ongoing maintenance and enhancements. Capital will be required in
2015 to fund Oracle consultants/SMEs to support second and third phases
of the www.rtd-denver.com website development.

Bike Parking and Accessibility Plan Implementation
Districtwide
Implementation of the recommendations from the Bike Parking and
Accessibility Plan (in progress, to be completed summer 2014). These will
include improvements to transit facilities to make them more bike friendly,
for example, signage indicating where bike parking is located on the site
and roadway markings that allow bikes to move through transit facilities
more safely. In addition, new types of bike parking will be recommended for
demonstration projects and budget will be needed to site, purchase, and
install the bike parking.

Boil Off Tank in Radiator Shop
Project is to add a boil off tank in the radiator shop at District Shops. After
the radiators are cleaned the water from the cleaning process needs to be
disposed of as hazardous waste. The boil off tank will boil the water down
to sludge thus reducing the amount of hazardous waste to be disposed of.

Elevator Monitoring System @ US36 Corridor
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit
FM installed (2) Golder monitoring modules in April of 2013 at the
Broomfield bridge elevators as a test project. The monitors send an email
alarm as soon as an event in the elevator affects the safety chain of the
elevator controller. The SCC and FM are notified when an event occurs so
that they can start the call out process with Kone Elevators and get the
elevator back into service as soon as possible. So far the alarm and
notification has worked well and this project would increase the use of the
current technology and create a more reliable and accessible elevator unit
at all the sites along US36.

Consultant Support for District-Wide Best Practices
Districtwide
RTD's District Historian is responsible for creating District-wide best
practices at multiple levels including at the Executive/SLT level, the Middle
Manager level and at the Operater level. In 2014, the focus is on creating a
high level Executive/SLT focused best practices document. In 2015, the
intent is to have a more focused, detailed best practices document with
input from all levels (Middle Manager and Operator Levels) and from all
departments. To accomplish this task the District Historian will need
consultant resources to conduct a statistically valid survey of RTD
departments and proviide support to help produce more detailed
documentation of Best Practices. This survey would be run with support
from RTD's Marketing Department and would have a sample size of 2500
to 2700.

RTD typically conducts a license plate survey at each of the District’s 78
Park-n-Rides on an annual basis. Information from this survey is used to
calibrate the travel demand and ridership forecasting model. In order to
perform the annual surveys, RTD requires assistance from a contractor in
collecting data from each of its 78 Park-n-Rides. These data are the
license plate numbers from each vehicle parked in each Park-n-Ride on a
given weekday. This data has been collected annually since 2003.

As RTD moves forward with the implementation of Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) and Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) through the
TOD Pilot Program and other TOD/TOC projects, there is a need to fund
due diligence costs for preparing RFQs/RFPs and/or responding to
unsolicited proposals for development on RTD land. Lead items that need
to be addressed in advance of releasing RFQs/RFPs, in response to
proposals from local jurisdictions, or in response to an unsolicited
proposals from developers include: obtaining land title commitments,
conducting Alta surveys to define land parcel boundaries, Phase 1 and 2
environmental studies, geotechnical work, and in some cases appraisals to
determine fair market value of RTD property. TOD Predevelopment Due
Diligence has been identified in the SBP since 2014. Based on the
experience from 2013/2014, the budget for due diligence tasks has been
adjusted upward from previous funding levels.

Title/Description

Location

Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors
and maintains things of value to an entity or group. IT asset management is
the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory
functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making
for the IT environment. This is also one of the processes defined within IT
service management. The goal of this project is to replace the current asset
management system, ZenWorks, which is inadequate for the current and
future computing size of the District. A more robust integrated system is
needed for hardware/software compliance auditing, configuration control,
and adequate capacity forecasting. This includes the tracking of computers,
servers, software, mobile devices, computer equipment, tablets, laptops,
monitors, etc.

support the growth and development of RTD's BI practice to support the
immediate and future analytical reporting needs across the agency. This
would require additional resources to continue to support BI initiatives of
RTD and maximize our return on investment in our BI platform: - 2
additional FTEs for IT BI team to help standardize and maintain functional
data and support ongoing report development and end-user training. Capital to fund development of an enterprise-level BI assessment and
strategy in 2015. - Capital to source consultants to support report and
dashboard development in 2015 and train IT and super-users to further
develop internal expertise. Furthermore, RTD's business intelligence
platform will be migrated from Oracle Exalogic to Exalytics servers (RTD
currently has 2 Exalytic servers for production and test). Exalytics servers
are specifically designed to deliver high performance analytics, modeling
and planning and were purchased by RTD to support future development
and growth of our BI platform. This request is to purchase a third server for
DR.

Client-Level Encryption Software for Portable Devices
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a
way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption doesn't prevent
hacking but it reduces the likelihood that the hacker will be able to read the
data that is encrypted. On all workstations: provide users with an easy to
use solution for encrypting client-side files, where user works with sensitive
data (ex. SPI). For portable workstations (ex. laptops): provide whole disk
encryption. Centrally managed keys will allow users to encrypt data on their
workstations or in files, but allow authorized RTD administrators with the
key to unencrypt/read information on corporate managed devices if
required (ex. for a records request) or in an emergency.

Datacenter Cloud Study (WO)
District Shops - Operations Center
A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated
components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It
generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data
communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning,
fire suppression) and various security devices. Large data centers are
industrial scale operations using as much electricity as a small town. RTD
remains as dependent as ever on its primary data center located at District
Shops to meet its efficiency and growth objectives. Rigorous data center
capacity planning and management is critical to serving today's enterprise.
At their core, these disciplines are required to insure that the data center
can accommodate both the expected and unexpected needs of the
business. The movement toward distributed computing infrastructures has
eroded the transparency between business requirements and data center
capacity. With systems now spread across multiple physical as well as
logical elements all connected by a shared network within a shared data
center, it is significantly more difficult to take "vertical slices" through the
infrastructure which business-centric capacity planning and management
requires. RTD's District Shops data center has nearly reached the number
of equipment / devices it can reasonably store without causing costly
damage (outages / physical damage) to RTD. In order to mitigate / reduce
the risk of costly damage, RTD must look to expand the data center in a
cost-effective, resource-efficient way. RTD IT wishes to conduct a study to
explore such options.

Title/Description

Location

As RTD continues to grow, so does the complexity of managing records
and informational artifacts across the agency’s departments and systems.
Enterprise Records and Information department is conducting a
comprehensive assessment in 2014 (4 phase ECM project) of the
organization’s as-is records and informational assets processes. The first
phase of the assessment is to construct a holistic review of the business
needs, review best practices, define risks and probable
organization/cultural changes, and construct the roadmap for moving
forward in the process. Based on the outcome of this study, and with the
approval and support of Senior Leadership, the other phases include
Solution Development, Solution Deployment, and Solution Support. This is
not specifically a software implementation project, although that may be
part of the ultimate solution. It will also require consulting services and
probable addition to RTD staff. Much depends on the outcome of the study
and the direction provided by the Senior Leadership team. Ultimately, our
goal is to implement an enterprise wide ECM and also migrate all records
and key artifacts from legacy systems and shared drives. This must be
done in alignment with RTD’s corporate taxonomy and must follow the
agency’s corporate retention schedule and policies. The migration of
existing records is a big task, but must be completed to align the various
departments into a single tool and ensure centralized governance of RTD’s
record management policies and guidelines.
Enterprise Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Study/Replacement
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
TrapezeCOM has been the only CRM tool in use for the past 8 years at
RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and limited in its
functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
Fastracks, and the SmartCard system use their own CRM tools to collect
customer feedback that is not integrated. The recommendation from the
Smart Card Business Process Reingeneering (SMT BPR) is that RTD
procure and implement an Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet
the needs of all departments and projects. The first phase (2015) of this
project is to initiate an enterpise-level study to perform a needs analysis,
develop processes and procedures, document required reports and key
performance measures, perform a gap analysis and make
recommendations on a system to meet the current and future needs of
RTD. The second phase (2016) is to purchase and implement an enterpise
CRM. If the CRM study shows there is an acceptable hosted cloud based
offering, like salesforce.com, the required capital funding would drop and
be replaced with annual expense and IT would only need to request 1 new
FTE.
Exadata Storage Expansion
District Shops - Operations Center
Over the last 5 years, RTD made a strategic decision to invest in an Oracle
Exadata database solution. The Oracle Exadata Database machine is
engineered to be the highest performing and most available platform for
running the Oracle Database. Oracle Exadata runs all types of database
workloads including Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), Data
Warehousing (DW) and consolidation of mixed workloads. Simple and fast
to implement, the Oracle Exadata Database machine powers and protects
your most important databases and is the ideal foundation for a
consolidated database cloud. Expansion of the Exadata storage is needed
in order to accommodate new systems coming online.

Fiber-optic lines are strands of optically pure glass as thin as a human hair
that carry digital information over long distances. Since 1990, when opticalamplification systems became commercially available, the
telecommunications industry has laid a vast network of intercity and
transoceanic fiber communication lines. Across the Denver Metro area,
there are a number of groups / organizations that share in the ownership of
existing fiber, i.e., RTD, CDOT, SCADA. This fiber is used by these
organizations to support major infrastructure projects including FasTracks,

Information Storage Unit Replacement
District Shops - Operations Center
RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all District
information and computing services. A wide array of departments and
applications use these storage units to store mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a technology
consisting of computer components and recording media used to retain
digital information. It is a core function and fundamental component of
computers. The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what
manipulates raw information by performing computations. In practice,
almost all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but
larger and cheaper options farther away. In computing, a portfolio of
storage products, including: online storage, near-online (nearline) storage,
storage networking, archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software
are required to run the Enterprise.

IT Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that
monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy
violations and produces reports to a management station. An IDS can
detect and distinguish between different types of legitimate or suspicious
network traffic, and flag harmful traffic to administrators. If the software is
prevention enabled (an intrusion prevention system, or IPS), it can block
the harmful traffic before it becomes an issue. In addition, organizations
use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSes) for other
purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting
existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. An
IDPS is a must-have tool for any serious in-depth computer security plan.

Risk analysis is the process of defining and analyzing the dangers to
individuals, businesses and government agencies posed by potential
natural and human-caused adverse events. In IT, a risk analysis report can
be used to align technology-related objectives with a company's business
objectives. This process-driven analysis tool and repository will: - track,
compare, and prioritize risks for remediation, such as those that are
brought forward by security management tools, staff notification, security
incidents, new policy implementation, and audits - align IT risk priorities with
business risk priorities (ex. something that may look important to IT is not
as important to the business, or vice versa) - assist with communicating risk
areas to our business leadership, creating a risk "heat map," produce trend
reporting on active and resolved risks and incidents - give RTD leadership
an at-a-glance view into our technology risk landscape and strong/weak
areas before audits and other critical events - assist a compliance officer in
generating and tracking remediation plans to make sure that key issues are
resolved in a timely manner - apply analysis and metrics to measure
performance and enable continual improvement Having this infrastructure
in place will better position RTD as a whole to make intelligent decisions
about where and how to tackle technology-based security and compliance
risks.

Off-Site Back-Up Tape & Records Storage
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
RTD routinely creates and stores back-up tapes (storage media that is
used to back up all RTD’s electronic systems and electronic records for offline storage and archive data retrieval). RTD’s back-up tapes are currently
stored off-site at Iron Mountain (a vendor that provides storage and
retrieval services). On the other hand, physical records (paper records and
other media such as CDs) which represent important RTD information and
project documents are stored in an RTD operated storage facility. We are
requesting funds to contract a vendor to store and manage the retrieval of
both RTD’s back-up tapes and physical records at an off-site vendor
managed and owned facility. The initial task will be to conduct an RFP for
this work to ensure the most appropriate vendor is selected.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a
proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle
cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM,
and POS cards. Defined by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards
Council, the standard was created to increase controls around cardholder
data to reduce credit card fraud via its exposure. Validation of compliance
is done annually by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) that
creates a Report on Compliance (ROC) for organizations handling large
volumes of transactions, or by a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for
companies handling smaller volumes. This project aims to deploy a suite of
tools and services that allow RTD to achieve and maintain PCI, HIPAA,
and industry standards of compliance and security, and specifically does
the following: - scans systems to gather configuration data (ex. security
settings) - assesses configuration data to a pre-defined or custom-defined
baseline, policy, or regulatory requirement set and highlights gaps
(compliance checking) - performs an automated check for industry-known
weaknesses that might exist in our web applications and networked
systems (vulnerability testing) both internal to RTD and external (from
Internet); must be a qualified vendor under PCI - provides security technical
experts to perform penetration testing (meaning, a sanctioned hacking
exercise) against our network and web applications internally and externally
to assess our weaknesses and recommend solutions - monitors key
system files for changes that may be made by an unauthorized party (file
integrity monitoring) - aggregates and correlates system activity logs and
flags suspicious events for examination by a security analyst (security
information and event management).

Secure Coding Training for Web Application Developers
Project is to provide training for existing/new application developers on
secure coding practices. Secure coding/application security is the practice
of developing applications, whether for computers, mobile devices or the
web, in such a manner as to provide defense-in-depth against malicious
attacks (ex. hacking, malware). Best practices are in place for coders, but
many in the application development field either do not know these best
practices, or do not know them well enough to move quickly through the
development process enough to reach their application launch goals.

TIC Contact Center Integration and Enhancement
District Shops - Operations Center
The purpose of this project is to upgrade RTD's Telephone Information
Center (TIC) to industry-standard software to provide a better customer
interaction experience, improve call center agent performance and
satisfaction and eliminate our current piecemeal and outdated technology
and manual processes. This request speaks to upgrading only TIC, not the
Access-a-Ride call center, which is not an ideal scenario. At the time of this
request, we only have estimates based on converting TIC. While
converting both will be a bit more expensive, there are discounts that
become available to us, such as those based on number of concurrent
users, number of workstations, etc. In addition, a primary goal in a project
of this scope would be to eliminate out-of-date hardware and software,
which we would only be able to accomplish by converting both call centers.
This scenario is based on a product called Customer Interaction Center
(CIC) from Interactive Intelligence.

Title/Description

Location

With the implementation of the INIT's CAD/AVL system for fixed-route
buses, RTD is able to provide up-to-date predicted arrival information (also
known as real-time passenger information) to riders. Studies completed at
agencies that have implemented real-time information delivery
demonstrate that the delivery of this critical information to riders will
strongly increase overall satisfaction with public transit, decrease wait time,
increase transit trips per week, increase the feeling of safety, and increase
ridership by reducing the feeling of uncertainty that hinders infrequent/nonriders from using transit. In addition, incident and delay information can be
captured and delivered to internal RTD departments for greater efficiency.
Riders who have access to real-time information feel more in control of
their trip and perceive a shorter wait time, leading to an increase in overall
satisfaction. In order to ensure that riders have access to this timesensitive information, real-time information must be disseminated to the
most relevant, reliable, and widely accessible communication channels to
meet the diverse needs our riders. In addition, the information delivered
must be simple, timely, relevant, accurate, easily understood, and targeted.
The exponential increase in mobile internet usage over the last 5 years has
changed the way in which transit agencies deliver real-time information.
Analysts predict that more people will browse the internet on their
mobile/tablet devices than on traditional desktop/laptop computers in 2015
making the delivery of real-time information on mobile devices an essential
part of RTD's communications strategy. A customer panel focus group
conducted in Q1 2014 found that mobile apps are highly desirable for the
majority of RTD customers. An app incorporating real-time information,
push notifications, intelligent trip planning, and personalization or
recognition of returning customer behavior is highly sought after. A realtime information delivery plan will be formulated in 2014. Expenses include
warranty and IT staff to manage and a business owner.

The initial implementation of RTD's enterprise content management system
and web content platform (Oracle WebCenter Sites) is planned in 2014.
Oracle WebCenter Sites will support the development of a new www.rtddenver.com website to enable the Communications Department and other
business users to easily create and manage contextually relevant and
targeted interactive online experiences across web, mobile, and social
channels. The WebCenter product will enable RTD to deliver a compelling
digital experience to customers by deploying and managing sophisticated
and engaging websites across digital channels. This solution automates the
process of managing the web – including business-user content authoring,
delivery of high-scale dynamic sites, content targeting and optimization,
delivering accessible code, user-generated content, social networking
integration, end-user personalization, and mobile content delivery. This
product will provide Marketing with new targeting capabilities to deliver
customized messages to defined audiences to increase engagement and
content syndication. This flexible, scalable online platform will also integrate
easily with other enterprise technologies such as business intelligence,
social relationship management, customer relationship management, and
more. Going forward, the Digital Marketing team will also require 2 FTEs to
implement, support, and build out the product with the newly available
features and tools, manage content, and design/develop the initial set-up
and ongoing maintenance and enhancements. Capital will be required in
2015 to fund Oracle consultants/SMEs to support second and third phases
of the www.rtd-denver.com website development.

RTD is dedicated to providing the best transit experience to each and
every rider. Accessibility will continue to be a main concern of RTD. In the
web industry, web accessibility best practices and standards are defined by
Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act and the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines of the World Wide Web Consortium. Web
accessibility ensures that all customers and potential customers can use
digital media (specifically websites) to find information and perform tasks. A
website is only accessible when a person with disabilities can use it as
effectively as a person without disabilities. In 2013, RTD hired a vendor,
Interactive Accessibility, to perform a comprehensive assessment of our
various digital communication channels to provide recommendations and
remediation steps to allow RTD to develop an action plan to achieve
compliance. Interactive Accessibility provided a detailed report outlining the
steps that will need to be taken to certify that RTD’s main website, rtddenver.com, meets WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. Communications is
requesting funds to bring in an accessibility expert to complete the items
listed in Interactive Accessibility’s report to bring RTD’s website into
compliance with WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. This contractor will share
his/her expertise with current RTD staff tasked with developing new web
content/products to ensure new items are coded in an accessible fashion.
Under the supervision of Marketing’s Digital Team and in conjunction with
IT’s Development Team, this contractor will be tasked with developing a
methodology for remediating the site using Interactive Accessibility’s report
and will create a cheat sheet with code-specific examples for implementing
reusable functionality on www.rtd-denver.com (such as modals, collapsible
content, photo rotators, etc). We require $100,000 to resource an
accessibility expert to complete the items listed in Interactive Accessibility’s
report. Training of RTD staff estimated at $55,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

RTD Board of Directors

Date: July 10, 2014

From:

General Manager Oversight and Performance
Committee, Director Bagley, Chair

GM

Date:
Subject:

Board Meeting Date: July 15, 2014
Approval of General Manager's 2015 Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s goals for 2015 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee is working with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board approved the goal setting process for the General Manager. That process
defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General Manager.
Beginning in 2011, these goals will include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the General
Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the General
Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual joint Board and staff
Advance Planning Session that occurs at the beginning of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals using the same
salaried employee performance evaluation form that is used by the rest of the RTD employees. This
action item is to formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed these 2015 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved them on
7/01/14 to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2015 and the four task goals for 2015. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for 2015
is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to implementing this policy.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2015 goals. This will
complete the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager to revise the 2015
goals. This will delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.

3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear and documented process.
