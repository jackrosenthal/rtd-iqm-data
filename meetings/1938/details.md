## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Sisk acknowledged the contribution of the retiring employees and how much institutionalized knowledge that they possess.  Collectively they had over 63 years of agency knowledge and experience.

Bruce Abel, AGM Bus Operations introduced each of the retiring employees:

Dean Shaklee – General Superintendent of Maintenance – 34 years

Dean has been with this agency for 34 years, starting his career in 1984 in general maintenance and rising through the ranks.  Dean plans to focus his retirement on the 3G’s:  golfing, grandchildren and gardening.  Dean enjoys woodworking and working on old tires and automobiles.

General Manager Washington presented Dean with his General Manager award and coin for his outstanding contribution to this agency.

Dean’s wife Debbie was in the audience to see Dean receive this sendoff.

Dean thanked the Board for supporting him and maintenance for the past 11 years.  He thanked General Manager Washington and AGM Bruce Abel for letting him do his job.  Most importantly, he thanked all the employees for doing a great job.

Robert W. Rynerson – Senior Service Planner/Scheduler – 29 years

Robert Rynerson who has served as an unofficial historian of the Denver transit system, is also retiring with over 29 years of experience.  Robert started his career over 40 years ago in Alberta Canada.  He was instrumental in developing a number of service plans, most recently the West Corridor service plan and the Denver Union Station Plan.  Robert’s immediate plans are to travel to Europe, spend time with grandkids, one of whom is a budding system planner at the age of 3.  The job that Robert has performed over these last years is excellent par none, and he has served as a mentor for many in the service area.  The task of synchronizing the rail schedules with the bus stations is intricate and complicated but Robert has done an excellent job in this area.

Robert expressed that when he first came here, some of the people thought he was crazy for going where they did not have rail.  Nevertheless, he has seen this grow into fruition.  He has worked with a good team in service but feels the time is right to leave while we are in-between of cutting over a new corridor.  He knows the new team will do a great job as well.

General Manager Washington also presented Robert with his General Manager award and coin.

Both retirees received full applause.

Special Recognition – 2014 APTA International Rodeo

Chair Sisk indicated we had a special recognition for the employees who participated in the international APTA rail rodeo in Montreal.  Austin Jenkins provided the introductions and stated RTD has the best employees in all North America having garnished the 3rd place overall in this competition.  He asked Bill Bell and Phil Eberl to provide the introductions of the teams.

Bill Bell presented the rail operators.  Bryan Coy has been at RTD for only 4 years and 2-1/2 years in rail.  He and Aaron Boettcher, who was not present, came in 7th place in this competition.

RTD is extremely proud of all of our employees who are dedicated to their work and do a great job of representing this agency.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Sisk opened the meeting up for public participation and asked each speaker to please state his or her name and address.  He reminded the speakers that they have a time limit of 3 minutes.  Chair Sisk recognized our elected officials in attendance as speaking first.

- Honorable Mayor Michael B. Hancock, Denver, stated that he was here this evening to share the City of Denver’s support for making an amendment to the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) to include the Southeast Rail Extension.  He said that as the Board knows, General Manager Washington has done a tremendous job finding ways to get FasTracks built.  Mayor Hancock noted that this amendment allows for tremendous creativity and for the Southeast Extension to remain eligible for federal funding.  He reiterated that his presence here tonight is to share his unequivocal support.  He thanked the Board, General Manager Washington, and RTD staff for all their tremendous work.

- Honorable Mayor Jim Gunning, Lone Tree, thanked the Board for this extraordinary opportunity for the Southeast.  He appreciates everything the Board and staff has done to make this project happen.  He noted that he has spoken before the Board a number of times in support of other lines or extensions.  Mayor Gunning expressed his appreciation for staff’s thinking outside the box to continue to more FasTracks forward.  While the Southeast Extension is contained in Lone Tree, it is really a regional asset that benefits the people, employees, and companies in the area.  He said that his community is really excited to enhance their transit footprint.  Mayor Gunning shared that it is a regional consortium that has come forward with the local cash match as well as right-of-way, which he believes makes a strong statement about the areas commitment to transit.  His community looks forward to moving forward and appreciates the effort that has been put in by all involved.

- Chair Sisk recognized that Mayor Gunning has been a tireless supporter of regional collaboration, benefiting the entire area.  Chair Sisk thanked him for his hard work and dedication.

- Honorable Mayor Herb Atchison, Westminster, said that he was here to express his support, similar to Mayors Hancock and Gunning, of the Southeast Extension.  He stated that each time we get another corridor done, we get that much closer to completing the entire FasTracks system.  He noted that everyone understands the challenges that RTD has faced, especially the Northwest Corridor, but tonight his community is here to support a public partnership with everyone in the entire FasTracks District.  The private industry is stepping forward with private funds to create opportunities to build the system that much faster; he anticipates there will be additional opportunities in the future for other corridors.  Mayor Atchison shared that General Manager Washington told him that RTD would continue to move forward with all the corridors.  He said that General Manager has not promised a date, but he plans to hold General Manager Washington accountable for moving forward at every opportunity within the system.  Mayor Atchison reiterated the need to have a sound and solid mass transportation system in the region to be competitive with other states.

- George Gerstle spoke on behalf of Elise Jones, Boulder County Commissioner, who was unable to attend this evening.  He read a letter from Commissioner Jones that is available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet in strong support for inclusion of State Highway 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the Denver Regional Council of Governments 2040 Regional Transportation Plan.  This letter noted that based on the results of the Northwest Area Mobility Study, transit mobility could be significantly and cost-effectively enhanced with a capital investment of just over $300M in six arterial BRT corridors.  It also recognized the wisdom in taking advantage of the additional funding available for the Southeast Rail Extension to advance this element of the FasTracks plan.

- Tom Clark, Denver Metro Economic Development Corporation, said that we are living in extraordinary times, a lot of which has to do with the vision of RTD.  He hopes that RTD can keep up the momentum of getting things built.  He hopes that the Board will approve the addition of SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit into the DRCOG 2040 Regional Transportation Plan.  Tom Clarke feels that the Southeast Extension is a testimony to the Board and RTD’s great work.

- Honorable Mayor Mike Waid, City of Parker, thanked each and every one of the Directors for the time and commitment they give to regional transportation.  He shared that last evening at the City Council meeting, the Council voted unanimously to support the accelerated construction of the Southeast Extension.  He provided a copy of the resolution that was passed, a full copy of which is available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet.  Mayor Waid stated that this does nothing but help the Town of Parker have access to a larger community base, providing greater access to Downtown and the entire Denver Metro area.

- Robert Partridge, Douglas County Commissioner, recognized that the Directors are probably used to seeing someone different from Douglas County, Commissioner Jack Hilbert.  He said that Commissioner Hilbert’s last day was Sunday, but he was a big supporter of transit.  Commissioner Partridge commented that he planned to say that all three Commissioners are fully supportive of the Southeast Extension but technically he can only say two.  He stated that Douglas County is not only ready to partner in committing funds to the Extension, the County has also already undergone a significant investment in the roadway system in this area.

At this time Chair Sisk read several letters into the record of individuals that were unable to attend the meeting.  These letters are from Honorable Mayor  Bob Murphy, City of Lakewood, Honorable Mayor Matthew Appelbaum, Boulder, Honorable Mayor Dennis Coombs, Longmont, Honorable Mayor  Steve Hogan, Aurora, Bruce Benson, University of Colorado President, and Cynthia Stovall, FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Co-Chair.  A copy of each of these letters is available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet.

Director Lubow indicated that she had spoken to Senator Matt Jones who was going to be sending a letter as well.  This letter was received later in the meeting and read into the record.  A copy of this letter is also available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet.

Chair Sisk, closing the Elected Officials portion of public participation, reminded the remainder of the speakers that each person would have a time limit of 3 minutes.

- Bradley Cokas, Aurora, stated that this evening he wanted to discuss fare evasion.  He recognizes that this may not be important to RTD as only 20% of the operating expense is covered by the fare box; however, he believes it is a much more serious problem that needs to be addressed.  Bradley Cokas thinks that paper transfers are obsolete and other technologies are available to cut down on people cheating the system.  He stated that allowing people to evade fare sends a bad message to RTD’s honest customers that pay the full fare each and every time they ride.  Bradley Cokas thanked the RTD drivers that are strict and enforce RTD’s policies.  He encouraged RTD to come up with an incentivized system, giving drivers a portion of what they collect, to encourage proper fare enforcement.

- Zoe Williams, 9to5, shared that she was hoping one of her members, Marissa, could come to the meeting; however, she is living in a shelter and her curfew conflicts with RTD’s meeting schedule.  Zoe Williams explained that Marissa was living in a shelter due to fleeing her stable life due to domestic violence.  Marissa was able to get a stable job and move out of the shelter but was worried that she would lose her job because she could not afford a transit pass.  Zoe Williams stated that was exactly what happened and Marissa is now living in a shelter again.  She expressed that there are people falling through the cracks between RTD’s non-profit program and being able to purchase a monthly pass.  She hopes that RTD will catch all riders that are dependent on our service as part of the public engagement process of the Fare Task Force.  She asked that RTD continue to include community feedback so there is a very robust process.

- Keith Smith, Executive Vice President of Coventry Development Corporation, stated that his company is creating RidgeGate, a mixed use development community.  He is at the meeting to speak in favor of the Southeast Rail Extension.  Keith Smith shared that in addition to the local cash match that Coventry will plan to provide, they are also donating 23 acres estimated to be worth $10 million.  He said that this Extension will stimulate new development and job growth in a community that is focused on transportation alternatives with a wide variety of house at various price points.

- Bill McMullen, Former RTD Director for District E, said that the last two months have been fantastic; the opening of the Crawford Hotel was unbelievable.  He said that he was here this evening to speak in favor of the Southeast Extension.  He feels it is so critical that RTD keep FasTracks on track.  He shared that he came on the Board in 2004 when FasTracks was approved.  He is so thrilled to see all the mayors here in support of the same thing as they were with FasTracks initial approval.  He urged the Board to vote in favor of the Southeast Extension; in a perfect would he would love to see a unanimous vote.  Bill McMullen stated that RTD has a history of success uniting the whole region; as a result when RTD pursues Full Funding Grant Agreements that is not an unachievable goal.  He reiterated the importance of voting in favor to move this organization along.

- Mike Reiser, Denver, came to the Board to speak about several accessibility concerns with Denver Union Station, specifically for those that are blind or have low vision.  He stated that currently the brail signs are not in consistent spots.  There is no accessible way to get a ticket if someone has to use the kiosk.  He shared that if you are waiting for a bus at a gate that has more than one route, there is no way to know what bus comes to the gate as there are no audible announcements.  He said that there is also not a way to look at a schedule accessibly because there are no schedules in brail or some type of electronic format.

- Jawidga Brown, Denver, reiterated Mike Rieser’s accessibility concerns.  She is a certified Orientation and Mobility Instructor, helping visually impaired individuals become independent.  She stated that the people who rely on transit because of their disability really have a hard time with accessibility.  She believes that Union Station can become accessible if RTD involves the ADA community.  Jawidga Brown said she would be more than happy to provide her help, as is the ADA Chapter in Colorado Springs.

- Felecia Gurule, 9to5, asked the Board to consider extending the time for a transfer.  She explained that sometimes her family does not have enough money to get on RTD to return home.

- Jorje Jimenez, 9to5, shared that he rides the bus for two hours each way to work.  He said that when he started using the bus he had to take his son out of after school activities because he could not get home in time to take him.  Jorje Jimenez noted that when he drove he paid $30 to $40 every two weeks for gas; now he buys a pass for about $80 so it costs about the same.  He wishes he could bring his family Downtown but he cannot afford it.  Jorje Jimenez stated that is why he is asking the Board to provide more affordable options like an income based pass.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, shared that he is in support of pursuing a grant for the Southeast Rail Extension.  He noted that his opinion was published in an editorial for the Denver Post.  He feels a sense of urgency that RTD needs to get this as soon as possible because of the uncertainty in Washington, D.C.  Doug Gragg reiterated his continual support of the people concerned about RTD’s high fares.  He believes RTD needs a rate reduction.

- Judy Enderle, Longmont, said that she came to the Board to voice her opinion about the Southeast Extension and the Northwest Rail Line.  She noted that she lives in the Northwest region and understands the issue with right-of-way preventing the Northwest Line from moving forward; however she respectfully asks that the Board look to find a more equitable solution for the Northwest Rail.  She believes it is stagnating and will not move forward without a better plan.

- Karen Benker, Longmont, shared that she served on the RTD Board from 1992 to 2000.  She stated that she was lucky enough to vote on the first five miles of rail construction that went through Denver.  Karen Benker said that it was very exciting and she understands what it is like to vote for new construction; however, she believes the Southeast Extension has an outrageous price tag.  Karen Benker feels like the Board has forgotten Boulder County.  There are zero rail projects scheduled for the County despite its 300 thousand residents.  Karen Benker stated that the people of Longmont voted for the FasTracks tax.  She wonders if the people of Lone Tree did.  She suggested that the Board pass a resolution establishing a fund dedicating any surplus funds for the Northwest Rail.  Karen Benker stated that there should be no additional extensions to other corridors until Boulder County gets its fair share.  She indicated that they are forming a citizens group promoting rail in Boulder County.

- Joan Peck, Longmont, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak.  She has been involved in many groups supporting citizens whose voices are not heard over the stakeholders.  She headed a petition to get fracking banned in the City of Longmont, which passed significantly.  She stated that she was here to tell the Board that even though Bus Rapid Transit is supported by the stakeholders, that I not what the residents have voted for or want.  She said that the citizens want their voices heard over the stakeholders.

- Mike Fitzgerald, Denver South Economic Development Partnership, came to speak in support of not only the Southeast Rail Extension but also SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit.  He believes that the region will not do well long term unless everything gets completed.  Mike Fitzgerald stated that with the Board’s help and leadership, Colorado is on its way to becoming a global crossroads of commerce and culture.  He shared that every company Denver South EDP works with tells them that their primary workforce are 25 to 40 who do not want to own card.  He reiterated his encouragement for the Board to support these actions and pledged that his organization will continue to work with RTD to come up with creative funding.

- Anne Lemberg shared that she wrote a letter to the Board regarding the barbaric hooliganism of RTD Security Officers who are the employees of the Denver Police Department (DPD).  She said that she has suffered personally, as well as witnessed others suffer, from their bullying.  There was a 16 year old boy who needed to get to school but the DPD Officers bullied him off the bus and threatened criminal action if he was even on RTD property again.  She believes that criminalizing the poor people that cannot afford to ride RTD is sheer barbarism.  Anne Lemberg stated that she has suffered a ticket that she wants expunged.  A copy of the letter is available in the Board Office.

- Maureen Tarrant, CEO of SkyRidge Medical Center, said that she was advocating for approval of the Southeast Extension.  She explained that this Extension was so important to her employees and patients.  Her organization is committed to the wonderful work that RTD has done.  The Extension will allow her patients from all throughout the Denver Metro area who are transit dependent better access to the facility.

- Brian McDonald, Charles Schwab, expressed his support of the Southeast Extension.  He believes that Denver had wonderful, cost effective public transit.  He shared that Charles Schwab is building their new location, along with a campus, at RidgeGate.  This location was selected because of light rail.  He stated that access to light rail will be an important factor in people’s decision to work for Charles Schwab.  He thanked the Board for their innovative solutions.

- Bonnie Dalrymple, Denver, said that she is a real estate broker who has 4 listings on Ogden Street near RTD’s 16th Avenue bus stop.  She stated that this bus stop is really an eye sore and is driving down the property values in the area.  She completed some comparisons between townhomes and condos near the bus stop versus ones that are just a few blocks away.  The sale price difference for townhomes was $46250 while for condos it was $182,000.  She asked that RTD remove this bus stop.  Documents for her comparisons are available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet.

- Justin Bateman, Denver, stated that the bus stop at 16th and Ogden has become a burden for the residents in the area.  There is no system in place to keep it clean or maintain.  He shared that residents bought a trash can and take care of trash removal but it is not enough.  He asked RTD to remove the bus stop.

- Bob Hampe, Denver, also expressed his desire to have the stop at 16th and Ogden removed.  He noted that the route along Ogden appears to be one of the most expensive routes for RTD.  He feels it would be advantageous for both RTD and the residents to have it removed.  Bob Hampe commented that other routes in the area only stop at 15th and 17th; he does not understand why this route needs a stop at 16th.

- Andrew Coonan, Helping Our People Excel, shared that he was here this evening to support RTD’s contract award to Veolia.  He said that Veolia provides his organization, along with 9 other non-profit hunger relief organizations, an in-kind donation of use of a warehouse in which Veolia only uses the parking lot.  He stated that this partnership really help the group serve low income families in the Denver metro region.

- Laura Jorawsky, Denver, agreed with the people requesting removal of the bus stop at 16th and Ogden.  She commented that they really do their best to maintain it but it is still not enough.  She also supported RTD reviewing the fare structure.  She wonders if RTD looked at dropping the price there might actually be an increase in riders, leading to more revenue.

Chair Sisk recognized that Director Lubow has some letter and emails she wanted the Board to review.  These are available in the July 15, 2014 Board Meeting Agenda Packet.

## VII. General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update

Committee Chair Bagley had no comments or updates as the General Manager 2015 goals were being approved this evening.

## VIII. Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of June 24, 2014

Motion:              Director Rivera Malpiede made the motion to approve the Board meeting minutes from June 24, 2014.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Folska indicated that she could not approve these minutes.  In the last FasTracks Committee meeting, Director Anderson had read a document into the record that she indicated was a public document and she could provide.  Director Folska has requested a copy of this document in its entirety be provided for transparency and be placed in the minutes especially if it was used to make an argument.  This document was not provided and she feels the minutes should be corrected.

Director Anderson responded she had provided the Board office with a copy of her comments but discovered the document she read was not a public document.  She stated the Board members can contact the City of Arvada to see if They could obtain a copy of the document.

Director Deadwyler commented that she shared the same concern as Director Folska—that a document was read into record and the request had been made to receive the full document, not excerpts.  She would make a motion to strike everything from the minutes pertaining to the document that Director Anderson read into the record.

Director Lubow seconded this request.

Director Solano made a motion to table the whole minutes until the full requested document had been received.

Director Folska seconded this motion.

Director Anderson called for a point of privilege and stated she had made comments and transcribed to the Board.  She has a right to do it.  She felt she was being attacked unnecessarily.

Chair Sisk responded to the question of privilege.  He said it was his understanding that Director Anderson had been asked at the FasTracks Committee meeting if she could provide the document and she had stated affirmatively and indicated it was a public document.  The document had been read into the records.

Rolf Asphaug, Deputy General Counsel, stated that what we were doing is approving minutes.  The option we have is to provide corrections to the minutes but the recommended motions and actions do not apply.

Director Folska responded she believe that all references to the document that Director Anderson had read at the FasTracks committee should be stricken from the record until the requested document had been provided.  She believes it is very important to make all information transparent, accessible and fully disclosed.

Director Solano added it is an issue of needing to be transparent.

Chair Sisk reiterated his understanding from Rolf Asphaug, legal counsel, that the minutes could only be accepted or approved and called for the question to vote on approval of the minutes.

Vote on the

Minutes:              The minutes passed with 11 in favor (Anderson,               Bagley, Deadwyler, Folska, Hoy, James, Menten,               Rivera-Malpiede, Sisk, Solano and Walker) and 1 opposed (Lubow).  Directors Daly, Lasater and Tobiassen were absent.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

### A. Award of “Group 25” Contracted Fixed-Route Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group 25” contracted fixed-route transit services with Veolia Transportation. This contract is for three years for an amount not to exceed $66,874,659 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $24,271,326 (option year 1) and $25,140,353 (option year 2), for a total five year not-to-exceed amount of $116,286,338. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately $13,799,677 for the initial three year contract term, $4,816,129 for option year 1, and $4,929,152 for option year 2, for a total of $23,544,958 for the five year period.  This results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $80,674,336 for the initial three year contract period and $139,831,296 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-021, to provide “Group 25” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 4, 2015.

### B. Approval of Construction Contract for the Central Park Station PnR & Bus Transfer Center

It is recommend by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a construction contract with M.A. Mortenson Company in the amount of $10,899,258.23 for the construction of the Central Park Station Park-n-Ride and Bus Transfer Center, which will serve the East Rail Line Central Park Station, regional and local buses and the local neighborhood.  Funding for this project is included in the 2014 Amended Budget for the Eagle Project and the non-FasTracks capital project for the Stapleton Park-n-Ride replacement.

##### a. Central Park Station PnR

### C. 2014 - 007 : RTP/Senate Bill 208 State Highway 119

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG an SB 208 Report in early 2015 which specifies the technology and the method of financing for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to approve the RTP/Senate Bill 208 State               Highway 119.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Folska expressed her appreciation to staff for the wonderful work that they had done on the NAMS study.  She appreciates the documents they have made available on this study.  However, she has still not seen the completed NAMS Study and does not believe that it exists.  For this reason, she cannot vote on something that does not exist.  She feels it is part of her fiduciary duty to fully understand what is in the document before voting for this action.

Director Anderson indicated that she will support. She saw lots of work and collaboration for this corridor to come together.  The Consensus Agreement and at least two letters that the Board received from the US 36 Coalition and Will Toor offered the best support for this decision.  This will provide faster and better connections between Longmont and Denver.  Will Toor’s letter pointed out the travel time of 53 minutes via bus versus 71 minutes on rail.  We need to approve this as a way to get on the list for federal and state dollars.

Director Solano shared that he initially opposed this action but after he thought about the highway congestion, etc. in that area and this is one way to alleviate that congestion, he will be voting yes.

Director Lubow stated she will support.  However, she understands and can appreciate Director Folska’ s position and she hopes we will get the full report as soon as possible.

Director Deadwyler stated she will not be supporting this action.  She thinks this is akin to the previous discussion on accepting excerpts from documents that the Board has not seen.  The Board will be held accountable for the full recommendation of that study when it is complete and she is not comfortable voting for this when the full scope of the recommendations from that study has not been reviewed.

Chair Sisk urged support and approval of this action.  He expressed this sends a wrong message in terms of regionalism.  While BRT may not be a wholesale solution, it is a chance to show regionalism.  He is concerned about the message we are sending and time is of the essence to approve this action.

Director Hoy stated he will vote in support.  We are a region.  The whole system needs to be connected.  It is imperative that we push the whole program forward.

Director Folska stated that she wholeheartedly supports regionalism.  She sits on the DRCOG Board and understands there is an opportunity to add this to the list when we are ready.  She cannot put her name on a document that does not exist.  It is incomprehensible to her that this Board would be OK voting on an action where the full report has not been provided.  The Board has a fiduciary responsibility to know what they are signing off on.

Director Walker commented that he will support.  This promotes what we do.  We approve projects all the time without having full information.

Director Solano reminded everyone that the NAMS study was a $2M effort.  The Board should know what is provided in that full study.

Vote on

The Motion:              The vote passed with 10 in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Hoy, James, Lubow, Menten, Rivera-Malpiede, Sisk, Solano, and Walker) and 2 opposed (Deadwyler and Folska).  Directors Daly, Lasater and Tobiassen were absent.

### D. 2014 - 008 : Approval to submit the RTD FasTracks Projects for the DRCOG 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (Baseline Report)

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution, which will permit staff to submit to DRCOG, by August 1, 2014, a Baseline Report on FasTracks in conformance with DRCOG’s request for ongoing review of the FasTracks Plan pursuant to C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 as outlined by DRCOG Resolution passed September 18, 2013. FasTracks projects and project elements that will be completed by 2040, as described in this report, will be included in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) currently being prepared by DRCOG.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to approve the submittal of the RTD FasTracks Projects for the DRCOG 2040 Regional Transportation Plan.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lubow expressed her appreciation for the arguments that have been made for approval of this action.  She shared there has been a lot of pressure for her to approve.  She stated that monies expended for this action would only leave people in the north further behind. Her constituents are outraged by this, especially since they will be paying taxes over 10 years without realizing any benefits.  She is a voice for the voiceless.  She had provided the Board with some copies of comments received and has given the Board office a full set of comments provided to her on this issue.  The comments basically express their outrage and that it is not fair.  One of the letters received was from former Board Chair and member, Mary Blue, who was instrumental in the passage of FasTracks.  She stated it was never intended to complete extensions before the other corridors were complete.  Representative Polly Christman also expressed her disappointment and that FasTracks was not getting built out equally across the region.  In addition, Brian Bagley, the Longmont City Council, and Matt Jones have expressed their concerns that the north is getting left out.  She would like people to understand that her opposition is not against the people in the South but that she must support the concerns of her constituent base.  For this matter, she will abstain.

Director Anderson stated that she respects Director Lubow’s position.  However, FasTracks was built on a regional perspective of cooperation, collaboration and compromise.

We need to leverage our assets for the full buildout of FasTracks in the wake of diminishing funding.  When the Eagle project came in under budget, those funds were reallocated for US 36, North Metro, I-225 and station improvements in Longmont. The elected officials in Arvada and Adams County did not object to these funds going to another corridor.  We have also benefited from the unsolicited bid for the North Metro Line.  The Board has been supportive of a number of processes.  We approved the new starts application for SE extension.  We need to be focused regionally.  It does not make sense to postpone a financial opportunity in the hand only to wait until, or if, Northwest becomes a viable option. She really would like the Board to refer back to the letter from Will Toor.  She remains optimistic that some way in the near future, other options will open up where RTD will not have to share ROW with BNSF.  Right now, we need to make good policy decision and vote for this action.

Director Folska indicated she will be providing her full support for this action.  There are three things which she feels this action will serve as an impetus:  (1) economic development (2) enhance quality of life (3) academic impact to our institutions.  Per Andrew Getz, this will have a full impact on this region.  She also wanted to provoke the thought that Douglas County could use COPS in good faith to help generate some funding that perhaps would allow us to divert some of the requested RTD funds into other corridors.

Director Solano indicated that his constituency base is saying no but for the sake of regionalism, he will vote yes and bite his tongue.

Director Hoy commented that it is truly about regionalism and providing mobility across town for people who may live north but work in the SE corridor.  The way he sees it, we can pay $207M or we can pay $65M for the project.  Make your choice.  By not taking this opportunity, we are squandering money—we can spend $1 and get someone else to spend $2.

Director Bagley commented this is not even his district.  It has already been stated most eloquently by the many elected officials and others who have spoken in favor of this motion as well as the letters that have been read into record.  He believes we need to move forward with this corridor and he wholeheartedly supports this action.

Chair Sisk read into record an email opposing this action from Representative Matt Jones.  Mr. Jones stated the $76M could be used to advance Northwest.  This is not fair or right.  RTD needs to focus on the future.  This is the kind of action that makes the people in the northwest angry and cynical.  A copy of this email is available in the Board meeting minutes notebook in the Board office.

Chair Sisk expressed his opinion this is a tremendous opportunity to advance FasTracks and it is not good policy to throw funding sources out of the window.  He is opposed to pitting the north against the south.  It is just good business sense to pay $65M for a $207M project.  This action tonight is a first step to get us into the RTP Plan.  There are still lots of work to be done.  Chair Sisk also expressed his appreciation to Director Solano for his vote change.  He knows how difficult a choice this was for him.

Director Menten expressed that she had voted yes from the committee to get this on the table for discussion.  She stated tonight she will be voting no.  She asked what guarantees do we have that the $25M in cash from the stakeholders will come through? How much debt, creation of special districts, etc. will funding for this item require?  We have no contract with the County or anyone else.  We do not know their finances.  The projected ridership has been decreased about 23%.  For her, it is all about the dollars and riderships.  We have no guarantees on the table to rest our hats.  She will vote no.

Director Folska responded this is not about the constituents.  It is the law that was passed in 2004.  The taxpayers voted.

Chair Sisk called for the question.

### F. Approval of General Manager's 2015 Goals

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General Manager’s goals for 2015 as defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to approve the General Manager’s 2015 goals.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Bagley, Chair of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee, provided this overview. The committee had met to review the GM Task goals for 2015.  The General Manager has core goals and task goals.  The core goals do not change and are based on his job description.  The tasks goals came from the strategic joint Board-staff planning advance held in March 2014.  He wanted to review the overall ranking and discussion of the tasks goals.

Task Goal 1:  Further advance the FasTracks Program toward completion

The committee agreed on the achieved goals.  Under the “exceed expectations” the committee had some disagreement.  There was a proposal to change the language to state the GM should achieve 1% above the standard 2-1/2%.  The committee did not agree on this and was voted to leave as is 3-2.

Task Goal 2:  Maintain fiscally sustainable posture and further develop financial plans

The committee agreed on this goal as drafted.

Task Goal 3:  Improve Service Delivery

The committee agreed to add language under “achieve goal” to “design/implement public process for involvement in a study of fare rates/structure that is inclusive of all RTD districts.”  The simplification of fare structure was actually a garden item from the joint Board-staff advance with 6 green dots and 6 reds.  Staff has already initiated action in 2014 to address this item.  The committee did not alter anything under “exceed expectations.”

Task Goal 4:  Implement Technological Advancements

Under “achieve Goals”, the GM consented to move the language for SMART card implementation, “SMARTCard implementation is operational and performs as designed”.  Under “exceeds expectation”, it was added “information will be made available in a generic format such as application programming interface (API) to enable outside developers and companies to register and obtain access to the APIs in development of their own applications development efforts, such as phone applications.”

These overall tasks goals were approved at the GM Oversight Committee 4-1.

Amendment to

The Motion:              Director Deadwyler thanked Director Bagley for this overview. She wanted to make an amendment to task goal 1 under exceed expectations.  Her reason is because goals are supposed to be SMART (specific, measurable, aligned, realistic and timely) but she did not feel the language “above the normal 2-1/2%”to be definitive.  It is not measurable or quantifiable.  She would like to make a motion to add 1% above the normal 2-1/2% match.

Director Folska seconded this motion.

Director Lubow stated her support of this motion.

Director Folska thanked Director Bagley for the fantastic work he has done with this committee.  We have come a long way from when the state auditor expressed the lack of governance and oversight of the GM.  The GM has done an excellent job, par none.  However, she does not feel it is unreasonable to add a stretch to his goal.  The GM makes things look too easy.  It is reasonable to ask for a more measurable goal.

Director Hoy stated he could not support this motion.  He sees two problems.  Adding a 1% to the 2-1/2% is tantamount to a 50% increase.  This is lots of money and he thinks it is unreasonable.

Director Anderson indicated she will vote against this amendment.  As she stated in committee, this is a game changer.  The Board is trying to change the rules of the game and sending the wrong message to our stakeholders and partners.  It is also important to remember that this committee will be doing the evaluation of his performance.  This committee can hold his feet to the fire and will judge whether he accomplished the goal.  It does not need to be totally spelled out.

Director Bagley stated that since 2004, we have looked at a 2-1/2% match.  This is like moving the goalpost. We are sending the wrong message.  Anyone who understands this knows how difficult it is to obtain the 2-1/2% match.

Director Deadwyler stated the 2-1/2% is standard.  These are the GM’s goals.  What does “beyond” or “above” mean?  We need to define these terms. Is it a penny more or a dime more?  The goals should be measurable and attainable.  We already know with the SE corridor that this is 16%.  Surely adding a 1% objective is neither outside the scope of the Board nor difficult for the GM to attain.

Chair Sisk called the question and asked for a vote on the amendment.

Amendment # 2:              Director Lubow made an amendment under task goal 1 “achieve goal” to add language to “take significant steps to overcome obstacles to complete each of the unfunded corridors.”

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Bagley stated that these goals had been discussed at the April 22 study session and Board members were asked to submit their changes.  The               only changes received were from Director Tobiassen.                They had set down with the General Manager to review these changes.

Director Hoy indicated he was not in favor of this motion.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Bagley indicated that the core goals relate to the job description.  The job of the Board is to look at the task goals.

Director Bagley expressed his appreciation to the Board for approving this motion.  He stated they will start the process in October for the evaluation performance of the GM 2014 goals.

Chair Sisk expressed thanks for the process and thinks it works well.

General Manager Washington thanked the GM Committee and the Board for their hard work.  He stated he may start to walk home tonight to Aurora so he can start stretching to the new heights they wanted to set for his goals.
