BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: January 8, 2013

Subject:

Selection of Location for Posting of Board
Notice

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The RTD Board of Directors designates the entry way of the RTD administrative office at 1600 Blake
Street as its official location for posting of notices of all public meetings in 2013 as required by C.R.S.
24-6-402(2)(c). In addition, to the maximum extent feasible, notices of public meetings will be posted
on RTD’s website.
BACKGROUND
Section 32-9-116 of the RTD Act requires all meetings of the Board to be held within the district and
open to the public. No business of the Board shall be transacted except at a regular or special meeting
at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the total membership of the Board is present.
C.R.S. 24-6-402(2) (c) of the Colorado Open Meetings Law provides definition of what constitutes an
open meeting and the process for notification. Article IV, section 5b of the Board Bylaws states notices
of all meetings shall be posted at least twenty-four hours in the public place designated annually by the
Board for the posting of notices prior to the holding of a meeting in the public place.
The purpose of this Board action is to designate the official posting site for notices of all public meetings
in 2013.
DISCUSSION
The Board has implemented a paperless solution and will provide notices of Board meetings utilizing a
web portal for public access. Publication of notices may also be found on this website but does not
replace the primary posting location of entry way at 1600 Blake Street.
ALTERNATIVES
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact.
