RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to ratify the 2024 Standing Committee appointments.

REPRESENTATIVE
Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2023, the Board Office solicited feedback from the Board on which standing
committees each Director was interested in serving in 2024. The Board Office compiled responses from
the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 11, 2024 Executive
Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:
Finance and Planning Committee
Operations and Safety Committee
Performance Committee
In adopting this recommended action, the Board seeks to meet the Strategic Plan priorities of Customer
Excellence, Community Value, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success by ensuring each of its

Packet Pg. 3

standing committees are set up for successful collaboration as well as effective governance and policy
making decisions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Executive Committee Work Plan

January 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Study Session on October 18, 2023, the Board of Directors discussed the idea of annual
committee work plans.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board’s Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, c.), the Executive Committee is tasked with “reviewing
and establishing the agenda for each regular meeting of the Board”, as well as “public affairs, external
relations, legislation, and ministerial matters.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and discuss the merits of including items
currently listed on the work plan as well as their contemplated timing. Additionally, the Directors should
provide additional input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already
included in the draft document.
Following the discussion, Board Office staff will work with the Chair of the Board and relevant senior
staff to further refine the work plan. The Committee will then review the work plan for approval at either
the January 25, 2024 meeting, or the February 22, 2024 meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Executive Committee’s ability to effectively govern directly
impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure that RTD’s

1.4.A

resources are used efficiently and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more focused,
collaborative, and obtainable.
