Summary of RTD Ad-hoc Security Committee Meetings
November 24, 2020

An Ad-hoc Committee on Security - consisting of Five RTD Board Directors was formed
to review the current security model. Five meetings were held beginning on October 28,
2020.
The committee members were, Board Chair Angie Rivera Malpiede, Director Kate
Williams, Director Shontel Lewis, Director Jeff Walker, and Director Lynn Guissinger.
Contributing participants were, AGM, Chief Safety & Security Officer: Mike Meader,
Chief of Police & Emergency Management: Bob Grado, Deputy Chief of Police: Steve
Martingano, and General Manager / CEO: Debra Johnson.
The committee began with a discussion on the history of the Transit Police Division and
the formation of the “Transit Police Authority.” The Transit Police Authority was
developed through Colorado State Legislation and approved in 2004. This authority
enabled RTD to create a law enforcement division and hire POST Certified Peace
Officers to serve within the agencies police bureau.
The current security model that includes Transit Police, contracted security and
secondary employment law enforcement was presented from its origin through its
evolution to the current state. The discussion included current resource allocation and
opportunities that exist for enhancement/improvement.
Staff then presented a recommended model (shown below) that would reallocate
existing funding to expand the internal Transit Police sworn staff and to subsequentially
reduce the number of non-sworn contracted security officers and secondary law
enforcement.
This recommendation was based on the size of the contracted security staffing model
and concerns that these individuals were being utilized in a role that was closer to the
types of duties that should be performed by professional police officers. Currently, RTD
contracts a contingency of more than 300 Security Officers, and many of them are
authorized to perform enforcement duties relating to fare. Contracted security officers
are often working solo without the direct supervision of RTD Law Enforcement.

1.I.1.a

The recommended reorganization would permit the Transit Police Division to
systematically increase staff and capabilities over a five-year, five phase deployment.
Each phase would reduce the number of security officers, with a goal of only utilizing
contracted security in the protection of critical infrastructure and ridership. At the end
of this phased program, contracted security officers will be utilized in a more traditional
roll of public safety, observation, and not in an enforcement capacity.

1.I.1.a

The committee discussed the need for ongoing Community Outreach and engagement
to receive input/feedback from our customers that will help to guide and hone the
recommended 5-year reorganization throughout the life of the reorganization and
beyond. The recommendation is that Directors invite CSSO Mike Meader, members of
the Transit Police staff, communications and civil rights to community meetings, Town
hall meetings, constituent forums, zoom meetings, etc.; to elicit feedback, answer
questions and concerns, and capture the information that is so critical to our success. In
addition, through continued weekly interviews with operators and our represented
employee Security Improvement Team members we will ensure our employees have a
voice as well. Feedback we receive through these outreach efforts can guide additional
community engagement as well.
We also discussed and encourage ideas for additional community engagement like a
“Police Cadet” program that would consist of young men and women represented
throughout the District. As well as the possibility of seeking scholarship funding from
organizations such as The Conference of Minority Transportation Officials (COMPTO), to
assist with the cost associated with sponsoring selected “Cadets” in a law enforcement
academy. It is our goal to create a very diverse transit police team and in the future
these citizens may be great candidates to recruit into full-time transit policing careers.
The security team will report on the status of the re-organization, present security
data, and update the board on information received from community engagement
efforts on at least a quarterly basis during the scheduled Operations and Financial
Audit committee meetings throughout the year.

Notes:

*Additional Budget Board Cation may be required in 2021 - 2022 to ensure
security levels are maintained during transition. (Additional Information below)
The Security budget has been reduced, to balance the overall RTD budget, each year for
the last three years from an operating budget of $33M in 2019 to the current projected
2021 budget of approximately $27M. This reorganization plan was developed under the
anticipated post COVID task force level of approximately $28.5M, but in the last two weeks

Packet Pg. 9

leading up to the final proposed 2021 budget that was just approved by the board on
November 17, 2020, an additional (approximately) $1.5M was removed from the Security
budget. As a result, this reorganization may require that additional funds be moved back to
the Security division budget through a board action in the amended budget process, CARES
funds or higher than expected tax revenue. This may be needed to maintain the desired
level of security while we hire and train new police officers (a 4-5-month process), prior to
reducing the corresponding armed security, so that those funds can be re-allocated for
ongoing funding.
