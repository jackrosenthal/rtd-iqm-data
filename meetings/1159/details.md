## V. Board Censure Policy Request

Director Rivera-Malpiede provided information on the nature of this request. She referenced the resolution # 005 of series 2008 regarding the Board Operating Guidelines and stated that we needed something with more teeth.  She has heard lots of concern from the community on various perception of inappropriateness of behavior.  She has noted that other elected officials have a censure process or policy and she wanted to have the discussion on if such a policy is appropriate for the RTD Board.

Marla Lien, legal counsel, asked for a clarification on whether we were asking about censure or censor.  Director Rivera-Malpiede stated censure.  Marla Lien then explained that the Board does not have the right or ability to restrict other Board members in what they discuss with constituents.  A Board member may have meetings with constituents or other elected officials and express their views which may differ from the official Board position.  She then cited a previous case where this issue was challenged under the 1st Amendment rights to free speech.

Director Rivera-Malpiede provided three specific instances of which she had concern:

1.       Board members asking for free tickets to events based on their perceived VIP status

2.       Using RTD time and meetings to promote their personal agenda or calling card

3.       Meeting with Cabinet or high-level officials for personal gain while misrepresenting themselves as on official RTD business.

Marla Lien responded that these represent two distinct issues:

- Items 2 and 3 are not in violation and the Board members are entitled to pass out their books, meet with whomever, and offer diverse points of views.  This is not inappropriate for an elected official.

- Item 1 may involve the Code of Ethics and solicitation of a meal or any item of value could be a violation of the Code of Ethics.  The Board could take an action to censure this but this could only take form in the way of disapproval of the action.  If probable cause or a financial gain, they may elect to take legal action.  However, she cautioned the Board against this and stated they need to make sure they have all the facts before pursuing such action.  This would not play well in the media and would reflect poorly on the agency in the school of public perception.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked to have this issue tabled until next month.

Directors Bagley and Hoy expressed some frustration over the lack of understanding of proper protocols and decorum.  Director Hoy shared the concern that having a frivolous or unofficial meeting with senior level Cabinet members could ultimately take away from the ability of setting up subsequent meetings with these officials on official RTD business.

Director Anderson shared she will be meeting with members of the Board one-on-one to review protocols and to share the Board Operating Guidelines.

General Counsel Marla Lien reiterated that Board members have 1st Amendment rights and no action can be taken against them for these actions.  General Manager Washington stated that it would be good that if a meeting is setup, an upfront acknowledgement that this is an unofficial request would be the right thing to do.  Part of the concern is the Cabinet that consisted of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary and their legal counsel assumed that the visit was official RTD business.  Director Hoy asked at what point was it disclosed that the visit was unofficial-at the time the meeting was setup, or when they arrived for the visit?  This would make a difference.

Director Walker asked Marla Lien if it makes a difference if there is a quorum or when people can represent the Board.  Marla Lien replied that there are situations where a Board member can be elected to represent the full interest of the Board or when staff can be sent as a delegate to represent the Board.  Generally, this is an understood thing.

Director Bagley expressed his opinion that if a Board member is traveling on a trip that is paid for by RTD, the purpose of that trip should be clear and there should be an understanding of the protocols or policies regarding the appropriate use of public funds.

The Committee agreed that it may be appropriate to have an independent person speak to the protocols and decorum for the legislative body.  This is an education process on how the Board can be more effective in representing the Agency as a whole.

Chair Anderson will work with the Board office and General Manager on follow-up to the concerns of protocols and decorum.

## VI. Other Matters

- Director Daly stated that he felt a special thank you should be given to Sherry Ellebracht for setting up the Legislative conference and how well the conference went.  Director Bagley added that he think this was a better conference this year and an effective use of the Board time. He thought the meeting with the FTA Administrator was most valuable.  General Manager Washington stated that the schedule was expanded to include more Congressional delegates this year.  Chair Anderson stated her compliments to everyone for the Hill visits.

The Committee voted to provide a special thanks to Sherry Ellebracht.

- Director Bagley shared that the CAC Committee had met in Highlands Ranch.  He appreciated that 13 of the CAC members from across the district drove out to Highlands Ranch for this visit.  He also shared that he spoke at the Denver Rotary Club of approximately 80 people in attendance.  The meeting went well and the people were receptive.

- Director Walker shared that he had met with the Englewood City Council this week and received a positive response.  They are enthused over the great relationship with RTD.  He also spoke to a neighborhood group who are excited about the trains.  They support the activities of RTD and understand the decisions that are being made.

- Director Walker inquired about the Resolution for sales use tax.  General Manager Washington indicated staff helped draft the resolution to make sure it was consistent with the provisions of the RAM that the Board approved.

- General Manager Washington indicated that when they were in Washington D.C., they had lobbied the FTA for more than an across the Board type allocation.  It was our perception that the FTA would receive funds to be used at their discretion.  Today, Congress approved $1.8B to be given to the FTA for distribution.  He thinks the timing and ASK from RTD was appropriate.

- Senate Bill 27 on parking passed out of committee 11-2.

- General Manager Washington noted there are five major APTA conferences and that the Board might want to consider how attendance might be spread out over these conferences.  Director Bagley added the Rail-vo-lution is also a good conference with innovative ideas. Chair Anderson shared she thinks there are benefits with attending some of the other conferences for the new Board members which will help them learn their job better.  They will think more about this idea while recognizing Board members have the discretion on how they choose to spend their travel budget.

- General Manager Washington asked the Committee to consider putting some of the updates that are discussed in the Operations Committee on the weekly GM report so that time spent in the meetings can be used more effectively.

- General Manager Washington requested the Committee to consider moving the start time for the Committees and Board meeting to 5:00 p.m.   Chair Anderson indicated she would have Paula to poll the Board members for this proposed change.

- Director Anderson will be meeting with each Board member to better understand how she can help them achieve their goals.  She will also be sharing the Code of Conduct with the members and visiting with them on protocols.

- Director Bagley indicated the first General Manager survey will be coming out around April 5 with a requested response time around April 10th.  General Manager Washington will provide his quarterly accomplishments and activities for this survey.
