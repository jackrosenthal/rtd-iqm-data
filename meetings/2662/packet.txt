BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: April 26, 2017

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant
Manager, Capital Programs

Date:

April 26, 2017

Subject:

Additional Funding for Triunity-Hill Joint
Venture Contract for FasTracks Construction
Management Support Consultant Services

General

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Triunity -Hill Joint
Venture for Construction Management Support Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks,
increasing the Not-to-Exceed contract value through July 14, 2020 by $19,250,000. Funding for
this award is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2020 in the specific projects
where CMSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future
year capital budgets.
BACKGROUND
In April 2014, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to the TriunityHill Joint Venture for an amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services. Notice to Proceed was issued on July 15, 2014, for a six-year contract with
four one-year options. This contract amendment would increase the total contract not-to-exceed
value through the contract end date of July 14, 2020 to $34,400,000.
As of April 21, 2017, RTD has contracted for a total of $13,405,863 in services to be delivered through
December 31, 2017, and is in the process of negotiating change orders for an additional $948,028,
which would bring the actual contract amount to $14,353,891. As of the February 2017 invoice, RTD
has paid out a total of $7,858,674 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill JV includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE goal of
27% for this contract. As of the February 2017 invoice, actual DBE participation has been 49.64% .
DISCUSSION
The CMSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control
of the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The CMSC provides key personnel to
support the program in specialized disciplines and short-term roles, generally meeting one or more of
the following criteria:





Technical knowledge or experience that RTD does not have in-house
Functions for which RTD cannot hire staff within its salary structure
Roles lasting less than a year
Functions that require less than a full-time equivalent employee

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that
position falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

actually brought into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is
still needed, and an interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The detailed scope of work for the CMSC contract is negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s
work tasks. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of the contract is to ensure that specific tasks
and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the FasTracks Program. The initial funding for the
contract covered the tasks and deliverables needed through the end of 2017. The requested
additional funding is expected to cover the tasks and deliverables needed through July 14, 2020. If
RTD needs additional services past the current contract end date, future Board action will be needed
to exercise the contract options and increase the contract not-to-exceed amount.
To date, the CMSC has provided the following support for the FasTracks program, and will continue
providing this support through the end of 2017:









Construction support for North Metro and Southeast Rail Extension
DBE support
Project controls support
Specialized planning and environmental support
TOD support
Specialized engineering support
Quality management support
Selected closeout staffing roles on the Eagle and I-225 corridors

RTD envisions the CMSC providing continuing support in those areas through 2020, as well as
additional support in the following areas:
 Closeout support for North Metro and Southeast Rail Extension
 Preparation of federally-required before and after studies for the Eagle and Southeast Rail
Extension projects
 Preparation of the annual Quality of Life report
The specific work scope for each future year would be established late in the prior year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the CMSC contract from would be $34,400,000 w ith
this amendment. These funds would be utilized upon inclusion in a specific future work program.
Funding for the future work program is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 20182020 in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in future year capital budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, increasing the Not-to-Exceed contract value through
July 14, 2020 by $19,250,000. Funding for this award is included in the 2016 Annual Program
Evaluation for 2018-2020 in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized, and
will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to increase the
contract not-to-exceed value. Instead, terminate the contract and perform all the work in-house
with RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff capacity to fill the roles
anticipated to be filled by CMSC personnel.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to increase the
contract not-to-exceed value. Instead, terminate the contract and re-solicit this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended as the CMSC is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable technical and project management assistance to the RTD
team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as
there would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Subject:

Approval of increased Contract Authorization
to Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC)
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

General

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
increase the board authorized contract amount with Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the
amount of $3,173,202. This will result in a total contract not-to-exceed authorization of $67,482,759
and will provide funding through the remainder of 2017. Funds for the contract authorization are
included in the specific project budgets where FRSC support would be utilized.
It is further recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the
contract completion date from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and increase the total
contract amount by $3,500,000, for a total contract authorization of $70,982,759. Funding for this
scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 in the specific projects where FRSC
support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018 capital budget.
BACKGROUND
In April 2005, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for the overall FasTracks Systems Engineering Services. On September 20,
2005 the RTD Board approved the selection and award to FRSC for the Systems Engineering work for a
six year term and an option for another six years. The RTD Board approved exercising the six year option
in November 2011.
FRSC has successfully performed the stated tasks outlined in the original Scope of Work. Specific
systems design and support scope in their contract includes traction electrification system (TES)
including overhead contact system (OCS) and traction power substations (TPSS), train control,
communication and central control system, corrosion control, systemwide electrical, rail vehicles, and
operation planning support. FRSC has worked with RTD staff in a number of areas:










Provided construction management support for the West Rail Line Project

1.B.2




Provided engineering review and inspection services of the Eagle P3 commuter rail vehicles
Provided engineering advising services in regard to the commuter rail vehicle equalizer beam
warranty issue

DISCUSSION
The RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant for the entire FasTracks Program for
consistency and standardization of design. This approach will save the RTD cost and will facilitate the
operation and maintenance of the system. The initial contract award was for the final design services
for the West Corridor and evaluation of commuter rail vehicle type. The work effort is consistent with
the work required to move each corridor forward and maintain the FasTracks schedule.
In particular, FRSC will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing; the Southeast Rail Line
Extension, the I-225 Rail Line, the North Metro Rail Line, the US36 BRT line and the Eagle Project. The
proposed Scope of Work to be performed under the increased Contract Authorization is as follows:


Program Management & Support Services
o Provide CADD and Quality Assurance services as required by RTD
o Provide project management and administration
o Provide coordination and project control, cost estimating, cost control assistance
o Provide document control functions for systems engineering

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2



Southeast Rail Extension Project
o Review submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
o Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering
o Assist RTD in reviewing the SERE Systems schedule
o Perform field inspections
o Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program
o Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes

RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to retain
the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet the final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. Other projects will be completing construction and entering systems integrated
testing in 2018 The proposed time extension to the FRSC contract would make the resources available
to RTD to complete construction, systems integrated testing, and project closeout in a timely and costeffective manner.
The contract extension through 2018 will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with
projected timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual were to leave the
FRSC team before the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all
remaining hours for that individual. Any future consultant support outside of these designated areas will
be procured through the Systems Engineering Consultant contract to be awarded later in 2017, and will
not be added to the scope of this contract.
Specific projects where FRSC assistance is anticipated in 2018 include:
o Eagle P3 Commuter Rail
o North Metro Rail Line
o Southeast Rail Extension
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 10%. To date FRSC has achieved a 17.5% DBE goal. Front
Range Systems Consultants has proposed a 13% DBE goal for the 2017 work, exceeding the RTD
proposed goal of 10%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized. Funding for
2018 scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 in the specific projects where
FRSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018 capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors increase the board authorized contract amount with Front
Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the amount of $3,173,202. This will result in a total contract
authorization of $67,482,759 and will provide funding through the remainder of 2017. Funds for the
contract authorization are included in the specific project budgets where FRSC support would be
utilized.
It is further recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and increase
the not-to-exceed contract amount by $3,500,000, for a total contract not-to-exceed authorization
of $70,982,759. Funding for this scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018
in the specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018
capital budget.
Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach. This is not
recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized staff to meet the System Engineering
needs of the FasTracks Program. Selection of alternative two could delay implementation of the
FasTracks Program.

Subject:

Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

General

Board Meeting Date: May 23, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for
Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date
from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019. Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is
included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects
where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized, and
will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital bud gets.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board has
approved subsequent contract amendments through June 30, 2017 that have brought the current
Contract Not-to-Exceed price up to $191,423,336. This contract amendment would not increase the
contract value beyond the current authorized amount.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
DISCUSSION
The Program Support Consultant Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six -year
option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The current end date of the
contract is June 30, 2017.
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where several of the ongoing corridor projects
have reached revenue service, and are entering the closeout phase. At this time, it is crucial to
retain the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts, meet final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects, and finalize the transactions and mapping that will secure the right -of-way
for the program alignments, including survey and mapping support for final acquisiti ons and utility
relocations, post-construction surveys, and filing of right-of-way plans. The proposed time extension
to the Jacobs contract would make the resources available to RTD to complete the project closeout
in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.3

In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD could face potential claims or lawsuits
related to its projects. Support from the PSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be
critical to resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
The contract extension will cover specific named individuals and functional areas, with projected
timeframes of availability for each one. In the event that a named individual were to leave Jacobs
before the end of the contract timeframe, the contract would be amended to remove all remaining
hours for that individual. Any future consultant support outside of these designated areas will be
procured through the Construction Management Support Consultant contract with Triunity -Hill, and
will not be added to the scope of this contract.
The contract extension identifies the following specific functions and tasks in support of FasTracks:
Program Management
 Provide track engineering support through the end of 2017.
 Assist RTD in coordinating the overall program-wide and project mapping, right-of-way (ROW),
and utility survey for all corridors and facilities.
North Metro
 Provide a full time Contract Manager through the first quarter of 2018.
 Provide environmental support through the first quarter of 2018.
 Provide construction support through the first quarter of 2018.
 Perform mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
I-225
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
 Provide construction support through project closeout.
SEC Ext.
 Provide mapping, survey and right-of-way support.
 Provide environmental support through the end of 2017.
Eagle P3 (East, Gold, CRMF, Northwest Rail Electrified Segment)
 Provide P3 and railroad support through project closeout
 Provide Federal Agency Liaison and Risk Manager through project closeout.
 Provide full time Project Controls Manager and Contract Manager through project closeout.
 Provide FEIS/ROD mitigation monitoring through project closeout.
 Provide a part-time System Safety Manager through the end of 2017.
 Provide field survey, mapping, and right-of-way management support.
 Provide construction oversight through project closeout.
West Rail
 Provide support to close remaining right-of-way issues.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 20.07%. RTD does not foresee any additional opportunities
for DBE subcontracting through this contract extension because all of the named roles are filled by
Jacobs employees. All of the DBE subcontractors with continuing roles on the FasTracks program also
participate in the Triunity-Hill contract. If RTD were to spend the full Contract Not to Exceed amount,
the DBE participation on the overall contract would be 18.72%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2019, would
remain at the currently authorized amount of $191,423,336 with this amendment. Funding for
project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks

capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for future
year scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects
where PSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year
capital budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve
a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services for
FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019.
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for
the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.
Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 -2019
in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in future year capital budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to extend the
contract completion date for Jacobs Engineering. This is not recommended because of the
institutional knowledge and background of the specific staff to be retained through this
amendment. As RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient level of expertise in a cost effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in the Background section,
the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed basis).
