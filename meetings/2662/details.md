#### 1. Additional Funding for Triunity-Hill Joint Venture Contract for FasTracks Construction Management Support Consultant Services

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for Construction Management Support Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, increasing the Not-to-Exceed contract value through July 14, 2020 by $19,250,000.  Funding for this award is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2020 in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital budgets.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 23, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs & Facilities, said that this contract is for the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture.  He noted that this contract will not add more time, but additional funding to retain institutional knowledge.  He stated that funds are available in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and the work that these consultants do is technical.  He added that while RTD can out-build and out-design anyone on a single project, RTD cannot do multiple projects at the same time.  He noted that Triunity-Hill is working on the North Metro and Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), and they are also providing design build support to the design build office, project control support across the system including document control, Transit Oriented Development (TOD) support for the Planning Department, and some of the planning and modeling support for RTD.  He stated that staff wants the Board to authorize additional funding to the contract and added that Triunity-Hill Joint Venture is 51% DBE managing partner and the goal of 27% has been exceeded to 49.64%.

Director Menten asked for an explanation about the TOD support that Triunity-Hill provides.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that RTD uses Triunity-Hill’s subcontractors with specialties in land use and real property valuation to help RTD to value, negotiate, and assess potential TOD deals.  He noted that the specialties in land use, real estate valuations, and economic analysis in relation to TOD assessments are beneficial to RTD.

Director Menten stated that she would be a no vote on this item.

Director Francone asked if the amount already paid out to Triunity-Hill is $14 million.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that staff has an authorization of $15.1 million, and to date Triunity-Hill has been paid $14,353,891.

Director Francone inquired how the $19 million increase was determined.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that during the APE every year staff reviews the support that is required to manage the various projects.  He said that staff looks at the support needed by role and then identifies the key players that are associated with that role.  He noted that the resource need was figured through 2020 and that is how staff determined the $19 million figure.  He added that the figure is based on the number of individuals RTD is employing from the consultants and their unit rate along with the hours needed to complete the tasks.

Director Francone added that there was a sentence in the Board Report that she did not understand.  She noted that under the Financial Impact heading it stated, “Funding for the future work program is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2020…”.

Mr. Stopplecamp indicated that was correct.  He noted that the APE runs for the duration of the project until 2044.  He added that if RTD does not need the money then it will not be spent.  He stated that all funds spent are reviewed and tracked.

Director Sisk said that the amounts seem to be increasing over the years at a significant rate.  He asked if the funds were coming out of the FasTracks budget.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that was correct.

Director Sisk commented that he was under the impression that RTD had a TOD staff.  He asked if that department was so buried with work that it could not take on the additional work that Triunity-Hill is doing.

Mr. Van Meter stated that RTD’s TOD staff is very talented, but they lack certain specialties in terms of understanding some of the complex deals that RTD is considering, including skillsets related to land valuations and analysis.  He noted that Triunity-Hill supplements in those specialty areas where it would not be cost effective for RTD to bring in full time staff.

Director Sisk remarked that RTD needs to have an exit strategy in terms of going forward as $19 million is a lot of money.

Mr. Stopplecamp indicated that using contractors is RTD’s exit strategy.  He noted that in the height of the of the FasTracks program RTD had 300 contractors working as RTD staff and RTD was spending $12 million a year with Jacobs Engineering.  He stated that at this time staff is asking for $6 million a year, which is half of what RTD was spending annually, and noted that as projects are ramping down RTD is drastically reducing staff that is not needed.

Director Folska inquired about the Quality of Life Study.

Mr. Van Meter stated that the Quality of Life Report is an annual report that RTD has prepared since 2006.  He commented that the report tracks metrics in terms of the impact that FasTracks has on the community, from transportation impacts to land use, to safety and security, and economics.  He said that every three to four years RTD does a comprehensive data analysis, and for the other years RTD prepares a high level report on the key measures that impact the community in large.  He added that Triunity-Hill and its contractors are tasked to provide data collection and analysis to support the creation of the Quality of Life Report.

Director Folska asked how much that report will cost and who did it before.

Mr. Van Meter said he could not recall the exact figure but said Jacobs Engineering previously created the report under their contract.

Director Folska stated that it is important to understand the quality of life aspects FasTracks has on the public.  She inquired if the report was being used by the Mobility Choice effort as well as other municipalities and agencies.

Mr. Van Meter remarked that the report is available on RTD’s website and staff distributes the report to others as well.

Committee Chair Lubow asked if Directors Anderson and Deadwyler had any questions.

Director Deadwyler commented that she has had concerns over the past six years with the Jacobs contract, and $19 million is a lot of money, therefore she would be a no vote.

Director Anderson remarked that $19 million is a lot of money, but when that amount is broken down to $6 million a year, and only using those funds when needed, it sheds a different light on the contract.  She added that it is much more efficient and the most effective way to take care of these issues, so she would be voting in support of this item.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Approval of increased Contract Authorization to Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant Services

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors increase the board authorized contract amount with Front Range Systems Consultants (FRSC) in the amount of $3,173,202. This will result in a total contract not-to-exceed authorization of $67,482,759 and will provide funding through the remainder of 2017. Funds for the contract authorization are included in the specific project budgets where FRSC support would be utilized.

It is further recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to FRSC to extend the contract completion date from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, and increase the total contract amount by $3,500,000, for a total contract authorization of $70,982,759.  Funding for this scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018 in the specific projects where FRSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the 2018 capital budget.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 23, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Mr. Stopplecamp stated that this is the second group of outside consultants that supports RTD staff.  He said that this will take care of the system elements such as the Overhead Catenary System (OCS), the signal systems, Ticket Vending Machine’s (TVMs), at-grade crossings, vehicles, and anything else that has electricity or moving equipment falls under this contract.  He noted that RTD staff oversees integration and the TVM’s and will bring in FRSC staff to ensure that the system elements are taken care of.  He remarked that the current contract runs out at the end of the year, and to get through the end of the year, it will cost $3.1 million for additional staff.  He added that, going into next year, staff would like to extend the contract to cover SERE support and Northwest Rail, to close out the Eagle P3, and to work on the boltsers for the commuter rail fleet.  He indicated that this is the same firm that is doing the work for Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and they will help RTD with the modifications to the vehicles here.  He added that they have worked on the Transportation Expansion Project (T-REX), the W Line, the R Line, Eagle P3, SERE, and North Metro and they also provide system support for the base system.  He remarked that staff wants to keep the key individuals on board and noted that RTD will go out for a separate request for proposal (RFP) in May for a replacement for FRSC starting at the end of this year.

Director Folska said it seems like RTD has to extend these contracts because the people we hired as the “best value” have delayed projects.  She asked if RTD would be reimbursed by the contractors.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that typically RTD absorbs the cost of extended overhead.

Director Folska asked why RTD had not hired another consultant to replace FRSC yet.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that RTD is in the process but there are some projects that will be wrapping up on the specialized service the first part of next year and staff does not want to lose the institutional knowledge from the people that have been working on the project for years.

Director Mihalik indicated that stated twice in the report, it says that FRSC will help with other government agencies and asked if those government agencies were helping pay for the cost of the work or if they would be receiving the work product at no charge.

Mr. Stopplecamp remarked that the other government entities are primarily the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC).  He indicated that they would not be receiving a product but instead helping RTD to coordinate and ensure that RTD is providing the product that they need in order to improve the system.

Director Solano asked if FRSC is consulting on the North Metro Line.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that there would be an update later in the meeting and stated that certain elements will go beyond 2018.  He said that at this time staff is planning to use FRSC for work they are currently doing and, as those individuals transition off the project, the new firm will come on board and take care of it.

Director Walker commented that, when the new RFP is issued, it is possible that FRSC could win.  He stated that he recognizes the need for consultants and said he would be supporting this item.

Director Francone remarked that staff anticipates that this type of support is needed beyond 2018 and asked why the contract was only extended for one year.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that staff is reviewing the on call contract for the entire system.  He noted that, after staff sat down with Procurement, it made sense to bid out the work again.  He added that FRSC has been with RTD for 12 years and there were concerns that RTD was not getting the best value.  He commented that he has faith in FRSC but said it is time to compare them to the rest of the industry.

Director Francone said that it is inconsistent to say that RTD wants to retain institutional knowledge but then say that the agency needs the best value for next year.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that, as RTD does base system projects, staff will be bringing consultants to fill those roles.  He noted that the system elements for SERE and North Metro should be taken care of by the end of 2018.  He added that FRSC will also be on hand to close out the University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line, and R Line through 2018.

Director Francone asked if this group would shrink significantly by the end of 2018.

Mr. Stopplecamp confirmed that RTD’s goal is to replace consultant roles with RTD employees as projects are closed out.

Director Deadwyler asked how long the new contractors would work for RTD.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that, when the new firm is hired, they will work for RTD for a five-year term to provide support on the FasTracks and base systems.  He noted that RTD is hiring a firm, not individuals, but RTD needs a firm that has the resources to pull people in to augment staff.

Director Deadwyler stated that she would be voting yes on this item.

Director Anderson added that she too would be supporting this item.  She said that RTD cannot have it both ways and it is good that staff is going to ask for new bids for this work after a long period of time to ensure that RTD is still getting a good deal.

Committee Chair Lubow declared the motion PASSED.

#### 3. Approval of Contract Extension for Jacobs Engineering for FasTracks Program Support Consulting Services

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering for Program Support Consulting Services (PSC) for FasTracks, to extend the contract completion date from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2019.  Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized.  Funding for future year scope is included in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation for 2018-2019 in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in future year capital budgets.

Motion:               Director Broom made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 23, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Mr. Stopplecamp stated that the Jacobs extension is for specialized services for individuals with institutional knowledge.  The current Jacobs contract ends July 2017 and the two elements that they are uniquely positioned for are Surveying and Right of Way (ROW).  He added that staff is not asking for additional funds, but instead to extend the contract through 2019.

Committee Chair Lubow declared that the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Rail~Volution Conference Planning Update

Mr. Van Meter stated that Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities, would provide a brief update on Rail~Volution that RTD will be hosting later this year.

Mr. Sirois remarked that the conference is focused on communities ranging from advocacy for transit, to TOD, to community engagement.  The conference began in 1995 and RTD has been a partner member since the late 1990s.  He stated that typically, there are 1,200-1,500 participants and RTD has formed a local host committee.  He said that the conference’s 25 mobile workshops are being coordinated with local communities so there will be an extensive opportunity to get out and see the system.  He noted that staff is focusing on geographic diversity as well as certain themes such as affordable housing, bike infrastructure, and highlighting infrastructure progress.  In addition, staff is trying to highlight the progress between Denver in 2000, when RTD last hosted the conference, and Denver today.

Mr. Sirois said the opening reception will be held at Union Station on Sunday, September 17th and there will be volunteers available to give tours of Union Station.

He noted that the conference will have a total of 75 workshops will touch on a variety of topics ranging from advocating for transit to implementing TOD and there will be a unique “local day” event that will focus of local issues.  He added that there will also be pre-conference activities for attendees to participate in that would include either a Rockies game, craft brewery tour, downtown scavenger hunt, hike in Boulder, or a central bike tour.

Mr. Sirois stated that registration for the conference will open in early June, and there will be reduced-cost registrations available for the Board.  He added that the finalized conference sessions will be posted in late July or early August, and staff is recruiting a diverse set of volunteers to help during the conference.

Committee Chair Lubow asked if the local hosts are required to contribute funds to the conference.

Mr. Sirois remarked that RTD has budgeted $115,000 and staff will also fundraise for sponsorship dollars.

Committee Chair Lubow inquired as to what the Board’s responsibility would be during the conference.

Mr. Sirois indicated that the Board could become volunteers, but he recommended that the Board attend the conference as well as the mobile workshops.  He noted that the conference would provide a diverse perspective and is very different compared to an American Public Transportation Association (APTA) conference.

Director Walker commented that Rail~Volution is a lot different than APTA.  He added that he would be opening his home to people that need help getting here and said that it is one of the better conferences available for dialogue.

Director Williams noted that staff should reach out to Denver Public Schools (DPS) for volunteers.

Director Francone stated that if RTD asks schools for volunteers, they should include Jefferson County schools as well.  She asked in addition to the host sponsors whether RTD asked any local jurisdictions to participate.

Mr. Sirois indicated they were invited.

Director Menten inquired if the local host committee sponsors wrote a check for their sponsorship.

Mr. Sirois said no, to be on the local host committee they were not required to write a check, but they were asked to contribute to the conference.

Director Menten asked if non-profit entities were using tax payer dollars to contribute to the conference.

Mr. Sirois commented that most of the entities on the sponsor list are private, but there are some public entities, non-profits, and foundations as well.  He noted that some of the foundations have contributed funds for scholarships, such as the Denver Health Foundation that committed $5,000 for people to attend the conference.  He added that RTD does not expect financial contributions from the non-profit sector as they have limited budgets.

Director Deadwyler stated that she wants RTD to solicit volunteers from the community.  She added that RTD should also consider the weather for the Union Station reception and be prepared for any weather conditions.

Mr. Sirois remarked that staff is trying to get community members involved in the workshops as they could provide unique perspectives.  He noted that an interesting tour that is currently proposed is to experience what it is like to be a single mother who uses transit to get to daycare and other places.  He also stated that staff is securing a tent for the outside portion of the reception to help protect from any weather issues.

Director Menten asked what other transit agencies have spent when they hosted Rail~Volution.

Mr. Sirois stated that he reached out to the last two hosts, Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), and both had similar budgeted amounts.  He indicated that both spent close to $115,000 and they both raised additional sponsorship dollars than they had planned, which meant they could save some of their budgeted funds.

##### a. RV Board Update 5.2.17

#### 2. North Metro

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that he and Ashland Vaughn, Project Manager-Engineering, would present the update for the North Metro Line.  Mr. Stopplecamp remarked that in 2013 the economy changed and RTD did not have the funding or method of building to build out the North Metro corridor.  He commented that at best estimates RTD determined that the line could be built out to 72nd Avenue.  He noted that in 2013 Regional Rail Partners (RRP), a joint venture between Balfour Beatty and Graham Construction & Management Inc., submitted an unsolicited proposal to build out the North Metro Line.  He noted that RRP was confident that they could get farther than 72nd Avenue.  He stated that RTD reviewed their proposal and from that staff developed a request for proposal (RFP).  He said that the task took a little more than three months and two firms bid on the project with the defined dollars and scope.

Mr. Stopplecamp indicated that the strengths for RRP were that several of their team members came off of the Eagle project and they knew what RTD and Denver Transit Partners (DPT) expected and were knowledgeable of those interactions.  He commented that RRP committed to build up to 124th with an option to the end of the line and said that they knew what needed to be done and how to make it happen.  He remarked that RTD took DTP through the proposal process and gave a notice to proceed in December of 2013 to construct the North Metro corridor with a scheduled completion date of January 2018.

Mr. Stopplecamp commented that RRP began work on the design process and in early 2014 provided RTD with a schedule that corroborated the completion for January 2018.  He noted that, in the last few months before RTD issued the contract to RRP, staff worked with them to value engineer the project.  He stated that the project was stretched from 72nd to 124th in that timeframe, realizing that several tasks would need to be turned over to RTD after the project completed.

Mr. Stopplecamp noted that RTD staffed up to provide oversight and verification of the project and explained that the RTD project team is not contractually permitted to dictate means and method.  Since RTD cannot tell RRP how to build the track, staff articulates that it must be built according to FRA standards from point A to point B.  He noted that the design took more time than was originally scheduled, but it was assumed that time could have been made up during construction.  RTD staff watched the project very closely, and in April 2016 staff began to see that construction was not progressing as expected, at which time staff requested a recovery schedule.  By July, there were significant concerns that the project was slipping but RRP still had had time to turn the project over to RTD in 2018.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that by November 2016 staff had yet to receive a recovery schedule after numerous requests and, through the escalation process, RTD staff met with RRP and reiterated concerns over the project.  He said the joint venture board agreed to provide an updated schedule but noted that the updated schedule was not received until April 15, 2017.  He stated that RTD staff has reviewed the schedule and found several logic errors, and at that time, staff could not predict when the construction side of the project would be completed.  He added that staff has been working with the contractor since RTD received the updated schedule, and they are reviewing every element of the schedule and making sure that the logic is tied together.  He stated for example that utilities cannot be added to a grade that is not prepared.  In some cases, the contractor is building the wall, putting in the utilities, and then adding the dirt, versus building the wall, adding the dirt, then installing the utilities.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that the next step is to figure out the schedule and the logic and how all of the tasks are tied together.  He explained that staff wants to identify the critical path and try and reduce the timeframe.  He added that, in order to ensure all major components have been identified, staff has brought on additional support to review where the project is and where it needs to go to get back on track.

Mr. Stopplecamp added that staff has ramped up resources and put more pressure on the contractor.  He said that staff’s goal is to knock out the previous items as fast as possible and to come back to the Board with a viable schedule, and at that time staff will present recommendations for the next steps and will also discuss the operations and maintenance options for that corridor.  He summarized that, the project is moving forward as one team, and RTD is providing additional resources to help RRP with the schedule and project phasing.  He noted that he and the General Manager have escalated a lot of these items to the joint venture board and stated there will also be an Elected Officials Briefing on May 18, 2017, to provide project updates.

Director Folska commented that this is a huge undertaking and a complex project.  She inquired if RTD extended all of the consulting contracts the Board just approved because RRP was behind schedule and asked why RTD was paying for their illogical sequence of events.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that RTD is not paying for their illogical sequence of events at this time.  He remarked that Director Folska is correct in that RTD is putting additional resources on this project due to RRP’s failure to complete the project on time.

Director Folska asked if this meant that RRP was in violation of their contract.

Mr. Stopplecamp said that was correct.

Director Williams questioned if there was any type of penalty for RRP’s delayed response in providing an updated schedule and asked what actions RTD could do in return.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that there is no penalty for taking a delay on the contract.  He noted that RTD has delayed some of their payments, but if RRP does not meet the January 2018 date, liquidated damages are only $300,000.  He indicated that their incentive, if they are found to be in breach of contract and they are responsible for the delays, would be the $1.5 million a month labor overhead costs.

Mr. Vaughn added that RTD has issued non-conformances through the contract and that is how RTD is able to withholds funds.  He stated that work is still going on, but it is a significant amount of funds that adds up.  He stated that staff is reviewing the recovery schedule to determine how to get back on track.

Director Francone reiterated that RRP did not respond for a year and was dismayed that staff knew about the ongoing issue but the Board was just hearing about it.

Mr. Stopplecamp remarked that in July 2016 RTD staff started to see that RRP was significantly behind schedule, which is when staff escalated the issue through the formal process and asked for the recovery schedule.  He stated that the reason staff held off informing the Board is because staff is unaware of the magnitude of the issues.  He commented that Mr. Vaughn’s team is working through back channels, and RTD staff is performing due diligence.  He added that RTD has not added any additional scope of work to the contractor and staff is using on-call contractors instead.

Director Francone said that staff should make sure RRP finishes the work they were contracted to do and not sign off on it until it is done.

Mr. Stopplecamp reiterated that at this time staff does not believe that the North Metro Line will be in service in 2018.

Director Tisdale stated that his concern is that, if RTD inserts itself into the process, RRP could say that they are behind schedule because of RTD’s interference.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that RTD is not inserting itself into their process, but staff is working on a parallel process.  He noted that if staff directs RRP, it will be through a contract amendment, and if the deliverable schedule is changed, it will also be done through an agreement with the contractor.  He noted that staff does not want to direct RRP, but they will point out items that are missing.  He added that staff is very careful, and Mr. Vaughn is the only staff member that corresponds with the contractor as he is the project manager.  He further noted that staff cannot allow RTD to jeopardize the commitments that RRP made at the very beginning.

Mr. Vaughn noted that, if RTD directs the contractor, that would change RTD’s risk profile dramatically.  He added that RTD is not directing but rather indicating that the contract outlines certain requirements that RRP must fulfill.

Director Broom asked what kind of excuses staff has received to date and further inquired if RRP had lost key personnel.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that he would rather not discuss their position in this forum but said that RTD is not at fault.

Director Broom asked if staff has a plan B if RRP cannot complete the project in a timely manner.

Mr. Stopplecamp indicated that staff has looked at plan B and plan C, which is why staff needed the updated recovery schedule in order to develop possible solutions.

Director Solano asked if any of the problems are in relation to the prime contractor not overseeing the subcontractors.

Mr. Vaughn commented that that was one of the issues.

Director Archuleta asked what type of issues the contractor was having.

Mr. Stopplecamp stated that it relayed to the sequencing of work.  He noted that they are not moving into the windows of opportunity or phasing work accordingly.

Mr. Vaughn added that the design approval is the main issue.  He remarked that all of the entities require design review and the crux of the issue is getting the design approvals in a timely fashion.

Mr. Stopplecamp noted that, if RRP would have followed the schedule from 2014, the project would have been completed on time.

Director Menten stated that she does not have the confidence in where this project is going and that is why she voted no on the first two action items.

Director Walker commented that some slippage is controllable and some is not.  He noted that design review is typically the reason for a project’s delay and the conflict is usually that what is submitted is either incomplete or inaccurate.

Mr. Stopplecamp noted that RTD is engaging with various entities to push the project through to completion.

Chair Hoy remarked that the Board is very disappointed, no one more than himself.  He said that he would have liked to be on the first train as a Director and asked if anyone from RRP was in the audience tonight.

Mr. Stopplecamp commented that RRP representatives were notified that staff would be discussing the North Metro Line during the committee meeting but did not attend.

Director Lubow indicated that this feels messy and she would have appreciated if the Board would have been informed earlier.  She added that there are probably a lot of lessons learned and there might have been better ways to deal with RRP, including having a tighter contract.

Director Anderson noted that this situation is akin to a bad marriage with a bad pre-nuptial agreement.  She said that there is a child involved, the North Metro Line, and RTD needs to make sure that a good outcome comes out of this mess.  She added that RTD and RRP need to work with local governments to help get the line opened in a timely manner.  She noted that this situation is regretful but she trusts staff will be able to work through the issue.  She stated that, while the line may not open in time, RTD and RRP need to keep working to get the job done.

Director Deadwyler indicated that it is obvious that this project will not finish on time and asked if RTD was prepared to go over budget to ensure the project is completed.

Mr. Stopplecamp explained that a 2% contingency was built into the project budget.  He said that this project is the tightest that RTD has ever had and the value engineering cost cutting measure to ensure the North Metro Line could get to 124th work on paper.  He noted that, at this time, RTD does not know what the additional costs will be and staff is managing the project the best that they can.

Director Folska acknowledged that the most expensive part of the line is from 72nd to 124th.  She stated that Balfour Beatty is also working on the SERE, which is the most expensive extension, and asked what assurances they provided to deliver on-time and on budget.

Mr. Stopplecamp remarked that the quality of work on SERE is fantastic.  He added that they are ahead of schedule and under budget.  He noted that the extension work is a success story, and Balfour Beatty by themselves have proven that they can do the job.

### D. Other Matters

Director Folska stated that she had recently learned that Chief John Tarbert had retired and remarked that he was a great addition to RTD.

Committee Chair Lubow noted that there has been a flurry of articles coming out of Longmont about the lack of rail.  She said that she is trying to get a motion put together with the Board to support finishing FasTracks as soon as possible and is working on the steps to get that completed.

General Manager Genova commented that he had sent an email to the Board on Friday, April 28th about the FRA extension for the University of Colorado A Line and B Line and said that the new extension is until July 30, 2017.  He noted that the University of Colorado A Line on-time performance was 91.2% year to date and 95% for the month of April.  He added that, earlier that same day, the FRA gave permission for limited testing of the G Line.  He stated that this is exciting news and RTD will have to work with the PUC during the testing.  He noted that the testing will be limited to a few trains a day and staff will keep the stakeholders updated.

Director Menten asked if the General Manager had spoken to Wheat Ridge about the testing for the G Line.

General Manager Genova remarked that he had sent emails to the Mayor and City Manager of both Wheat Ridge and Arvada as well as the Mayor of Denver.  He noted that he heard back from Mayor Marc Williams of Arvada and City Manager Patrick Goff of Wheat Ridge.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Lubow adjourned the meeting at 7:46 p.m.
