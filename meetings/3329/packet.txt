BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Title VI Program Update

Committee Meeting Date:
May 11, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2022 Title VI Program Update report in compliance with federal
laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Transit Equity Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI. Title VI prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin by recipients of federal funds.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients, RTD is required to submit a Title VI Program Update every three years.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff seeks the Board’s approval of the elements contained in the Title VI Program Update report, which
details the manner in which the agency intends to achieve compliance with the following objectives of
Title VI:
1. To ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin
2. To ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are sufficient to provide equal
access and mobility for any person without regard to race, color or national origin
3. To ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decision-making are provided to
persons without regard to race, color or national origin
4. To ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are made without regard to
race, color or national origin
5. To ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken to prevent disparate impacts borne by any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

Proposed Policy Updates
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter IV-4, a copy of Board meeting minutes or a resolution demonstrating
the Board’s consideration, awareness, and approval of the major service change policy, disparate impact
policy, and disproportionate burden policy is required. As identified in Attachments A and B, the
following are the proposed updates to the service disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies.
Additionally, staff is requesting an additional assessment of access to key public service destinations
(e.g., education, food, social and human service centers, and health care) as part of the service equity
analysis.
Service Disparate Impact Policy
1. To determine the system-wide effects of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted
non-minority population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10%
greater than the percentage of the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of
changes will be considered disparate.
2. To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted
non-minority population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10% less
than the percentage of the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will
be considered disparate.
Service Disproportionate Burden Policy
1. To determine the system-wide impacts of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's
impacted higher income population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at
least 10% greater than the percentage of the higher income population impacted, then the overall
impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden.
2. To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's
impacted higher income population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at
least 10% less than the percentage of the higher income population impacted, then the overall
impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden.
2021 Service Performance Monitoring Report
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter IV-4, results of the monitoring program of service standards and
policies and any action taken, including documentation (e.g., a resolution, copy of meeting minutes, or
similar documentation) to verify the Board’s consideration, awareness, and approval of the monitoring
results is required. Staff analysis shows that overall, there was no significant difference in average
performance between service provided to RTD’s minority and low-income customers and the service
provided to RTD’s non-minority and higher income customers. However, there are certain aspects that
were flagged as areas for improvement: 1) Revenue Hours of Service for minority light rail lines, and 2)
Revenue Hours of Service for low-income commuter rail lines. Additionally, RTD is unable to examine
vehicle assignments consistently or accurately at this time. The agency will explore other options to
report this measure later in Calendar Year 2022, allowing for this portion of the analysis to be
completed. The full results of the 2021 Service Performance Monitoring are demonstrated in Attachment
C.

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

2022 Language Access Plan
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter III-7, agencies are required to develop a Language Assistance Plan
for providing language assistance to persons with limited English proficiency (LEP), based on U.S.
Department of Transportation LEP Guidance. As demonstrated in Attachment D, RTD’s updated
Language Assistance Plan (LAP) will guide the agency’s language assistance measures from 2022 to
2025. After an extensive review of the 2019 LAP, RTD’s LEP inter-division workgroup will implement a
two-tiered approach to retain and expand upon past language assistance measures to better meet the
needs of people with limited English proficiency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2022 Title VI Program Update will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

2022 Title VI Program Update
Executive Summary
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD’s) functional mission to provide public
transit service within the Denver region. An equitable mass transit system distributes the benefits and adverse
effects of transit service fairly without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle
is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order (EO) 12898 pertaining
to environmental justice (EJ).
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs
receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the
ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued EO 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make achieving
environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies and activities on minority populations and lowincome populations.”
The intent of Title VI is to remove barriers and conditions that prevent minority and low-income persons as well
as persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) from equal access to public goods and services. In effect, Title
VI promotes fairness and equity in federally assisted programs and activities. Title VI is rooted in the
Constitutional guarantee that all human beings are entitled to equal protection of the law, and specifically
addresses involvement of impacted persons in the decision-making process.
There are many forms of unlawful discrimination based on race, color or national origin that can limit the
opportunity of underrepresented communities to gain equal access to services and programs. In operating a
federally assisted program,1 a recipient cannot, on the basis of race, color or national origin, either directly or
through contractual means cannot do the following:
•

Deny program services, aids or benefits;

•

Provide a different service, aid or benefit, or provide them in a manner different than they are provided
to others;

•

Omit participation and access by LEP persons; or

•

Segregate or separately treat individuals in any matter related to the receipt of any service, aid or benefit.

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA’s) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice (EJ). In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s)
Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three
years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
1

The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 amended each of the affected statutes by adding a section defining the word "program" to make clear that
discrimination is prohibited throughout an entire agency if any part of the agency receives federal financial assistance.

1.D.1.b

2022 Title VI Program Update

The General Manager and Chief Executive Officer has overall responsibility for carrying out the agency’s
commitment to the Title VI Program. RTD’s Civil Rights Director and Transit Equity Manager are chiefly
responsible for administering and monitoring Title VI requirements, but it is the duty of every employee and
contractor of the agency to ensure compliance with nondiscrimination and to further civil rights protections.
Thus, the RTD Board of Directors must approve the agency’s Title VI Program prior to its submittal to FTA.

Definitions
The following terms and definitions are from FTA Circular 4702.1B unless otherwise noted.
Direct Recipient – An entity that receives funding directly from the FTA. For purposes of Title VI, a direct
recipient is distinguished from a primary recipient in that a direct recipient does not extend financial assistance
to subrecipients, whereas a primary recipient does.
Discrimination – Any action or inaction, whether intentional or unintentional, in any program or activity of a
federal aid recipient, subrecipient or contractor that results in disparate treatment or disparate impact and/or
perpetuates the effects of prior discrimination based on race, color or national origin.
Disparate Impact – A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects members of a group
identified by race, color or national origin, where the recipient’s policy or practice lacks a substantial legitimate
justification and where there exists one or more alternatives that would serve the same legitimate objectives
but with less disproportionate effect on the basis of race, color or national origin.
Disparate Treatment – Actions that result in circumstances where similarly situated persons are intentionally
treated differently (i.e., less favorably) than others because of their race, color or national origin.
Disproportionate Burden – A neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects low-income populations
more than non-low-income populations. A finding of disproportionate burden requires the recipient to evaluate
alternatives and mitigate burdens where practicable.
Environmental Justice – EO 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations,” was signed by President Clinton on February 11, 1994. After issuance of the EO,
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a DOT Order for implementing the EO on EJ. The DOT
Order (Order 5610.2(a), “Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income
Populations,” 77 FR 27534, May 10, 2012) describes the process that the Department and its modal
administrations (including FTA) will use to incorporate EJ principles into programs, policies and activities.
Fare Media – a form of payment for transit service (i.e. cash fare, monthly pass, etc...).

the complainant will have 10 days from the date of the letter to send requested information to the RTD
investigator assigned to the case.

RTD will generally complete an investigation within sixty (60) days from receipt of a completed complaint form.
Although RTD strives to promptly resolve complaints, this process will differ depending on the complexity of the
complaint, the individuals involved and other factors. Once the investigation has concluded, the complainant will
receive a final response letter to the complaint.
If a complainant disagrees with RTD’s determination, they may request reconsideration by submitting a request
in writing to RTD’s Transit Equity Manager within seven (7) days after the date of RTD’s letter, stating with
specificity the basis for the reconsideration. The Transit Equity Manager will notify the complainant of their
decision either to accept or reject the request for reconsideration within ten (10) days. In cases where
reconsideration is granted, the Transit Equity Manager will issue a determination letter to the complainant upon
completion of the reconsideration review.
Title VI Investigations, Complaints, and Lawsuits
Federal recipients are required to directly accept, log, and investigate complaints of discrimination. Further,
recipients are required to notify the public of their right to complaint and the procedures for processing their
complaint. RTD has seen an increase in the frequency of complaints in the last three years.
Information regarding investigations, complaints and lawsuits for the reporting period is provided below.

To address the increase in complaints, RTD is implementing a Transit Equity Nondiscrimination training program.
The goal of the program is to provide customer facing employees with the cultural competency and awareness
necessary to enhance the customer experience for all.
Public Participation Plan
RTD has an established comprehensive public involvement process to ensure minority, low-income, and LEP
populations are engaged through public outreach and involvement activities. RTD’s Public Participation Plan
(PPP) in Attachment E was originally submitted to the FTA on May 2019 as part of the response to the FTA’s
Title VI Program Review and has been updated as part of this submittal. The Public Participation Plan also
describes RTD’s approach to achieving diversity on its non-elected advisory committee(s). RTD’s Transit Equity
Office serves as a resource to other RTD divisions to integrate these populations into RTD’s public involvement
activities.
In proposing service or fare changes, RTD uses a variety of methods to communicate and solicit feedback from
the community and targeted populations. RTD also engages in extensive community outreach in conjunction
with large-scale projects to ensure that affected residences and businesses are informed about the impacts and
benefits of the project and are provided an opportunity for input in planning and implementation. On routes
where there are a significant number of LEP customers or households, RTD staff translates materials to ensure
that those community members can participate. Special attention is paid to the identification of any transitreliant persons potentially affected by a route or service change.
Consistent with the requirements of Title VI, RTD staff use geographic information systems (GIS) mapping
software to create maps that identify affected low-income, minority and LEP communities.

2022 Title VI Program Update
The analysis is shared with RTD staff working with affected communities to identify strategies to engage minority,
low-income and LEP populations.
Community Engagement for 2022 Title VI Program Update

Transit Equity staff researched disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies from 16 transit agencies
and consulted with over 25 Title VI staff from FTA Regions VII, VIII, and X.
•

•

•

Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC): RTD staff consulted with CAC throughout the Program Update
process. At its February 16, 2022 meeting, CAC reviewed and discussed the proposed updates to the
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies. The committee also participated in the Transit
Equity Survey to give input on the Title VI Program Update and the revised Language Access Plan.
Transit Equity Survey: RTD also sent a questionnaire to staff at 36 community-based organizations as
well as leveraged multicultural partners to distribute the surveys (both English and Spanish). The
questionnaire asked about Title VI Program awareness, observations of changes to service or fares that
have had a significant impact on clients served, thoughts on what else should be considered when making
service changes and examples of evaluating policies for potential disproportionate impacts to low-income
persons and/or persons of color. RTD received a total of 210 responses to the questionnaire.
Dedicated Email Blast: Proposed Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies were then posted
on rtd-denver.com along with the full draft of the Title VI Program Update for public comment. How this
outreach informed RTD’s Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden policies and thresholds is
described in Part II: Title VI Equity Analysis Policies.

Language Access Plan
RTD is committed to full compliance with Title VI and Executive Order 13166 to provide meaningful access to
programs, services, and benefits for persons with limited English proficiency, or LEP. In 2022, RTD updated its
Language Access Plan and developed a 2022-2025 Implementation Schedule after an extensive review of the
LEP populations in the RTD service area and their needs. Staff will use the recommended two-tiered approach
to meet the needs of LEP populations: Tier One retains successful programs and activities designed to meet the
language needs of LEP populations, and Tier Two identifies new areas of focus to further the agency’s goal of
providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs and services. This plan will guide RTD in how
to best serve LEP populations and is provided in Attachment F.
Subrecipient Monitoring
RTD’s subrecipients of federal financial assistance must also comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
To meet its enforcement responsibilities under Title VI, RTD has implemented a subrecipient monitoring process.
The RTD Transit Equity Office will ensure that the following actions are taken to ensure that RTD and its
subrecipients comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B:
1. Each year subrecipients must provide RTD with a signed FTA Civil Rights Assurance (Subrecipient Title
VI Policy Statement) that all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have
been or will be compiled, as appropriate, and maintained.

The following items were completed to gather input on RTD’s Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
policies, adding access to key public service destinations into service equity analyses as well as RTD’s Language
Access Plan update.

1.D.1.b

2022 Title VI Program Update

In general, subrecipients should have a public participation process that offers early and continuous opportunities
for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic and environmental impacts of proposed
transportation decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement activities can
include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices at all stations and in all vehicles, and
measures targeted to overcome linguistic, institutional, cultural, economic, historical or other barriers that may
prevent minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a subrecipient’s decision-making.
Subrecipients must file documentation of their PPP with RTD.
Each subrecipient further agrees to comply with and assure compliance by its third-party subcontractors at any
tier under each grant, with all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, 49
CFR 21.5(b)(2), 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), and 49 CFR Part 21, Appendix C.
Subrecipient Title VI Program Review
As a designated recipient of FTA funds, RTD receives, administers, and allocates funds to subrecipients and is
responsible for documenting compliance with Title VI. RTD’s responsibilities include monitoring subrecipient
compliance with Title VI, collecting and reviewing Title VI documents (including subrecipient Title VI data to
FTA) and assisting subrecipients.
RTD developed the Subrecipient Title VI Compliance Guide (Attachment G) to help subrecipients understand
the federal requirements. The guide outlines programmatic and fiscal responsibilities of various roles to ensure
that subrecipients are complying with federal requirements and are using federal funds appropriately. Project
managers, who are ultimately responsible for the achievement of subrecipient outcomes, are involved in every
step of the process by ensuring that appropriate agreements are in place. Said agreements contain the required
federal, state, and local language; and performance measures and all compliance requirements are met.
Project Manager(s), Transit Equity Manager, Transit Equity Specialist and/or the Grants Administrator provide
ongoing assistance to subrecipients through communications, trainings (when requested) and access to subject
matter experts within RTD for information and data.
Subrecipients are made aware of the Title VI Program requirements prior to acceptance of grant funds. RTD
reviews all subrecipient Title VI Programs on a triennial basis and receives and reviews annual reports submitted
by November 1. RTD also monitors Title VI compliance with entities who receive local funding from RTD. Prior
to entering into funding agreements, partner entities are made aware of Title VI compliance requirements.
Service Performance Monitoring and Transit Service Policies and Standards
Transit Service Policies and Standards FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of
urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service
to ensure service is provided accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective
decision-making in the provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to

2. Each subrecipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD with a list of active
lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color or national
origin.
3. Each subrecipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent, conspicuous, and accessible
locations throughout its facilities.

ensure service is provided in a non-discriminatory manner. The detailed Service Performance Monitoring Report
can be found in Attachment H and the Transit Service Policies and Standards can be found in Attachment I.
Facility Siting and Construction

Title 49 CFR Section 21.9(b)(3) states, in determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant
may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or
subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race,
color or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment
of the objectives of the Act or this part.
Title 49 CFR part 21, Appendix C, Section (3)(iv) provides, the location of projects requiring land acquisition and
the displacement of persons from their residences and businesses may not be determined on the basis of race,
color or national origin.
According to the FTA Circular 4702.1B to comply with the regulations when constructing storage facilities,
maintenance facilities or operations centers.
1. Complete a Title VI equity analysis during the planning stage regarding where a project is located or
sited to ensure the location is selected without regard to race, color, or national origin. Recipients shall
engage in outreach to persons potentially impacted by the siting of facilities. The Title VI equity analysis
must compare the equity impacts of various siting alternatives, and the analysis must occur before the
selection of the preferred site.
2. When evaluating locations of facilities, recipients should give attention to other facilities with similar
impacts in the area to determine if any cumulative adverse impacts might result. Analysis should be done
at the U.S. Census tract or block group where appropriate to ensure that proper perspective is given to
localized impacts.
3. If the recipient determines that the location of the project will result in a Disparate Impact on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, the recipient may only locate the project in that location if there is a
substantial legitimate justification for locating the project there, and where there are no alternative
locations that would have a less Disparate Impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The
recipient must show how both tests are met; it is important to understand that in order to make this
showing, the recipient must consider and analyze alternatives to determine whether those alternatives
would have less of a Disparate Impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and then implement
the least discriminatory alternative.

Attachment: 2022 Title VI Program Update (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

Since the last Title VI Program submission in 2019, RTD has not selected a site for one facility meeting the
applicable definitions under Title VI. RTD’s process for conducting equity analyses related to facility siting and
construction follows the guidance provided in the Circular/Title 49 CFR and included below.

1.D.1.b

2022 Title VI Program Update
Part II: Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity.

Major Service Change
A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that would
remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis
that includes an analysis of adverse effects. A Title VI Service Equity Analysis will be completed for all major
service changes and will be presented to the RTD Board of Directors for its awareness, consideration and will be
included in the subsequent RTD Title VI Program report with a record of action taken by the Board.
Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes, but is not limited to
eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing
headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major
service changes.
Service Disparate Impact Policy
A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10% more than non-minority
populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact. Given a potential disparate impact, RTD will
evaluate whether there is an alternative that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact.
Otherwise, RTD will take measures to minimize or mitigate the adverse impact of the proposed action.
To determine the effects of a major service reduction to a single line/route, the percentage of RTD's impacted
minority population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted non-minority population. If the percentage
of the minority population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage of the non-minority population
impacted, then the impact of changes will be considered disparate.
To determine the system-wide effects of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted non-minority
population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage
of the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered disparate.
To determine the effects of a major service increase to a single line, the percentage of RTD's impacted minority
population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted non-minority population. If the percentage of the
minority population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage of the non-minority population impacted,
then the impact of changes will be considered disparate.
To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted non-minority
population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage of
the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered disparate.

Attachment: 2022 Title VI Program Update (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

In the development of the equity policies, RTD sought public feedback on the disparity and disproportionate
burden thresholds through a series of public meetings and surveys. These policies and their applicable thresholds
are listed below:

1.D.1.b

2022 Title VI Program Update
Service Disproportionate Burden Policy

To determine the effects of a major service reduction to a single line/route, the percentage of RTD's impacted
low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted higher income population. If the
percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage of the higher
income population impacted, then the impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden
To determine the system-wide impacts of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted higher income
population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage
of the higher income population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered a
disproportionate burden
To determine the effects of a major service increase to a single line/route, the percentage of RTD's impacted
low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted higher income population. If the
percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage of the higher income
population impacted, then the impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden
To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted higher income
population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage
of the higher income population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered a
disproportionate burden.
Upon determination of a disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will do one of the following:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize or mitigate potential disparate impacts or disproportionate
burdens, or;
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority customers but would still accomplish
the project or program goals.
Additional Access Considerations
To complement the quantitative disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses above, RTD may include
an assessment of access to key public service destinations (employment, education, food, social and human
service centers, and health care) for minority and low-income populations.

rtd-denver.com

17
Packet Pg. 23

Attachment: 2022 Title VI Program Update (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income population 10% more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden. Given a potential disparate impact,
RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable
impact. Otherwise, RTD will take measures to minimize or mitigate the adverse impact of the proposed action.
Low-income population is defined by RTD as a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the
Department of HHS Poverty Guidelines.

1.D.1.b

2022 Title VI Program Update
Public Participation and Board Approval

Between 2021 and 2022, RTD sent a questionnaire to staff at 36 organizations participating in the agency’s lowincome fare program for low-income transit customers and the Non-Profit Pass Program. The questionnaire
asked about Title VI program awareness, observations of changes to service or fares that have had a significant
impact on clients served, thoughts on what else should be considered when making service changes and
examples of evaluating policies for potential disproportionate impacts to low-income persons and/or persons of
color.
After reviewing survey responses, RTD decided to include access considerations (employment, education, food
or health care) when performing an equity analysis. Moreover, participants supported the former populationbased approach (i.e., looking at the low-income and minority population living by transit lines proposed for
changes was a good way to measure potential impacts) as well as the inclusion of customer surveys to the
extent possible.
The process to include system-wide analysis for the disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies for
service changes started with researching policies from 16 comparable transit agencies and consulting with over
25 Title VI staff from FTA Regions VII, VIII and X. RTD staff consulted with the CAC (February 16, 2022) as well
as community-based organizations (e.g., Denver Streets Partnerships, Growing Home, and CREA Results) and
received full support on these proposed changes.
Fare Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden Policy
Per the policy, the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income persons as a result of
any fare change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts
absorbed by the overall ridership. Further, if proposed changes require the use of or the discontinuance of fare
media, the equity analysis should consider access to fare media, vending machines, and other add-value
mechanisms (e.g., online, retail network), or other changes associated with the fare media’s use.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider modifying
the proposed fare change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can
demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to
proceed with the proposed change.
Major Service Change and Fare Change Equity Analysis
RTD considers possible equity impacts in developing potential service and fare changes and evaluates proposals
for major service changes and any fare changes for potential adverse effects, disparate impacts, and/or
disproportionate burdens.
Since the time of the last Title VI Program submittal, RTD has implemented several improvements to service
and changes to fares. The three reports noted below cover the equity analyses of all major service changes and
all fare changes implemented since May 2019, and are provided as Attachments J–M, along with corresponding
documentation of the RTD Board’s consideration, awareness, and approval of each.

Attachment: 2022 Title VI Program Update (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

Feedback on this Program and the policies therein generally did not differ between how RTD should treat analysis
of disparities based on race (disparate impact policy) and income (disproportionate burden policy). Thus, the
two policies remain equivalent.

RTD uses demographic data to assess equity in distribution of services, facilities, and amenities in relation to
minority, low-income and LEP populations. Such data informs RTD in the early stages of service, facilities and
programs planning and enables RTD to monitor ongoing service performance, analyze the effects of policies and
programs on these populations and take appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate potential disparities. RTD
develops GIS maps and comparative charts to perform this analysis, relying on both ridership and population
data within the service area.
The demographic data shown in this report is from the following sources:
•
•

2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS)
2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey

Current Service and Service Area
The maps shown in Figures V-1 to V-3 display the distribution of minority, low-income and LEP populations in
relation to services throughout the RTD service area.
Service Area with Minority Population in Figure V-1 depicts the RTD network in relation to minority population
by U.S. Census block group. Areas are shaded corresponding to block groups, which had a minority population
greater than or equal to the average for the RTD District (35.6%) as of the 2015-2019 ACS. This is an increase
from 34% indicated in the 2013-2018 ACS.
Service and Service Area with Low-Income Population in Figure V-2 depicts the RTD network in relation to lowincome population by U.S. Census block group. Low-income is defined as earning equal to or less than 150% of
the HSS federal poverty level. Areas are shaded corresponding to block groups, which had low-income
populations greater than or equal to the average for the RTD District (15.5%) as of the 2015-2019 ACS. There
are high concentrations of low-income households found throughout the service area.
LEP Population Distribution in Figure V-3 depicts the RTD network in relation to LEP population by U.S. Census
tract, as language information is not available at a smaller geographic scale. Areas are shaded corresponding to
all LEP population percentage by census tracts using the 2015-2019 ACS.

•

Approximately 50 percent of participants were men.
More than 60 percent of participants were non‐Hispanic white people (62%).
More than one‐half of participants were 45 years old or older (53%).
More than one‐third of participants reported residing in Denver county (37%).
Approximately 30 percent of participants were low-income individuals.
Nearly one‐third of passengers reported not having a car available to them (30%).

An analysis of ACS data and Customer Satisfaction Survey results reveals minority and low-income ridership are
predominately located within the densely populated urban communities of the RTD’s service area. Since the
2019 Title VI Program Update, the minority population has increased from 34% to 35.6% and low-income
population has decreased from 19% to 15.5% as noted in the ACS.
Facilities and Demographics Assessment
Three maps (Figures V-4, V-5 and V-6) are provided to illustrate determination of Title VI program compliance
with respect to recent, in-progress and planned major transit facilities. These respective figures highlight transit
facilities that:
1. Were recently6 replaced, improved, or;
2. Have improvements that are in progress, or;
3. Are where improvements are scheduled (planned projects and projects identified in planning documents
for an update in the next five years).
Figure V-7 shows the location of existing facilities. Figure V-8 Existing Facilities with Minority Population shows
the location of existing facilities in relation to Census block groups above the service district average for minority
populations (35.6%). Figure V-9 Existing Facilities with Low-Income Population shows the location of existing
facilities in relation to U.S. Census block groups above the service district average for low-income populations
(15.5%). Facilities are depicted by type: administrative, operations/maintenance, park and ride, and transit
centers.

RTD conducted the 2019 Customer Satisfaction Survey across all revenue generating services—including bus,
SkyRide, light rail, commuter rail and FlexRide services—to assess how those changes may have affected
customer satisfaction since 2017. The survey included various questions about participant characteristics,
including level of education, household income, race/ethnicity, age and gender. As shown below:

Title VI Service Monitoring Report
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) functional mission to provide public
transit services within the Denver region. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining
to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI
Program to the FTA every three years.
Service Standards and Transit Monitoring Overview
Part of RTD’s compliance with FTA Circular 4702.1B Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit
Administration Recipients (Title VI Circular) is ongoing performance monitoring across all service modes (bus,
light rail, and commuter rail). The Title VI Circular does not require monitoring for demand response service.
Aligned with RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff will conduct an annual review of resource and service
distribution. The objective is to ensure there is an equitable distribution across RTD’s system. The analysis in
this report compared minority and/or low-income access to that of non-minority and/or higher income access
across six service performance metrics for date compiled during calendar year 2021:
1. Revenue hours: RTD evaluates the amount and distribution of revenue hours of service provided.
The hours while in service include trip start to finish.
2. On-time performance: RTD defines “on-time” as no more than one minute early or five minutes
late, measured at time points.
3. Vehicle loads: RTD evaluates whether local, regional, SkyRide, Bus Rapid Transit, light and
commuter rail vehicles are overcrowded by comparing the load/seat factor for each vehicle type
and time period (peak and midday). RTD used automated passenger counter data to calculate
compliance with the maximum load standard. The maximum load factor is the ratio of the total
number of passengers on a trip to the total number of vehicle seats on each individual trip. For
each route, the count of the trips that exceeded the load factor are divided by the total number
of sampled trips to determine the percentage of trips that exceeded the load factor. RTD requires
that Vehicle Load standards be met 60% of the time.

Title VI Service Monitoring Report

5. Stop amenities: RTD analyzes the distribution of stop amenities in the RTD system (shelters,
seating, lighting, waste receptacles, etc.) in order to identify any potential disparities.
6. Vehicle assignment: The FTA expects that the average age of vehicles on minority and/or lowincome lines/routes should be no more than the average age of vehicles on non-minority and/or
higher income lines/routes.

Title VI Service Performance Measure Rating Scale Rubric
The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan objective is within 10% or better. This range will guide RTD in
establishing a baseline to set targets for subsequent years. Above the 10% threshold but within 20% would
result in a “marginal” score. A marginal score would be flagged as a caution and area for improvement. Any
composite measure that exceeds 20% would indicate “adverse impact” and would result in a system-wide
disparate impact1 /disproportionate burden2 finding per the Federal Transit Administration. RTD will work to
improve service and access on an on-going basis to ensure RTD’s equity targets are achieved and for compliance
with RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Program.

A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects members of a group identified by race, color, or national
origin.

A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects low-income populations more than non-low-income
populations.

4. Service availability: RTD considers persons residing within one-half mile of bus stops and/or rail
stations as having service available. Service availability is expressed as number and percentage
of District-wide population and is determined by vehicle mode.

Minority vs. Non-Minority Lines/Routes Performance Results
•

The percentage of stops containing each amenity on minority lines/routes exceeds the percentage for non-minority
lines/routes in all categories examined with the exception of ticket vending machines, which is higher for nonminority lines/routes (4 percent compared to 3 percent of stops, respectively).

Vehicle Loads (See Exhibit B for full details)
•
•

Average load/seat percentages range from a low of 0.00% to a high of 9.20%.
All average loads by mode are below the maximum load factor for every time period.

Revenue Hours (See Exhibit C for full details)
•
•
•
•

A slightly lower percentage of revenue hours of service are provided on minority bus routes than non-minority
routes (49% vs. 51%, respectively).
A lower percentage of revenue hours of service are provided on minority light rail lines than non-minority lines
(36% vs. 64%, respectively).
A greater percentage of revenue hours of service are provided on minority commuter rail lines than non-minority
lines (78% vs. 22%, respectively).
A slightly lower percentage of revenue hours of service are provided on all minority modes of service than all nonminority modes of service (48% vs. 52%, respectively).

On-time performance (OTP) (See Exhibit D for full details)
•

•

•
•

Average OTP for minority local bus lines is 1 percent lower than OTP for non-minority local bus routes on weekdays.
The Saturday and Sunday average OTP for minority local bus routes are 4 percent lower than OTP for non-minority
local bus routes.
Average OTP for minority regional bus lines is 9 percent greater than OTP for non-minority regional bus routes on
weekdays. The Saturday average OTP for minority regional bus routes is 10 percent greater than OTP for nonminority local bus routes. The Sunday average OTP for minority regional bus routes is 4 percent lower than OTP
for non-minority local bus routes.
Average OTP for the four minority light rail lines is 2 percent lower than the OTP for the three non-minority light
lines for Monday-Thursday, Friday, and Weekend.
All commuter rail lines are considered minority lines.

Vehicle Assignment (See Exhibit E for full details)
•
•

RTD is unable to examine vehicle assignments consistently or accurately at this time as indicated in Exhibit E. RTD
will explore other options to report this measure later this year, allowing for this portion of the analysis to be
completed.
For light and commuter rail there are no specific alignment for a certain model or year. RTD assigns the number of
vehicles per train and is based solely on ridership.

Service Availability (See Exhibit F for full details)
•

A higher percentage of the RTD district’s minority population lives within ½ mile of local bus, light rail, and
commuter service compared to the district’s non-minority population. Regional bus has a slightly higher percentage
for non-minority compared to minority (15.5% vs. 11.8%, respectively).

Title VI Service Monitoring Report
Exhibit E: Vehicle Assignment Justification

Attachment: Attachment H 2021 Service Performance Monitoring Report (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

At RTD, vehicle assignments are put together in blocks that typically consist of operations on
multiple routes (typically referred to as interlining or through lining). Putting work together in
blocks is operationally more efficient and takes less resources, but in many cases makes it
impossible to keep buses on a single route. Because of the way blocks are put together it is
possible to have a combination of contractors and RTD operators providing services on what we
constitute as a route. In other cases, a block could be composed of several different routes that
connect at common locations such as transfer centers. Add in limitations of the technology and
other factors it is difficult to assign a specific bus to operate on a specific route. As a result, RTD
is unable to examine vehicle assignments consistently or accurately at this time. RTD will explore
other options to report this measure later this year, allowing for this portion of the analysis to be
completed.
For light and commuter rail there are no specific alignment for a certain model or year. RTD
assigns the number of vehicles per train and is based solely on ridership.

12 Months (Block Group Level Data), USDOT National Address Database (NAD)
To adjust for the fact that some census block groups are only partially within the District, the fraction of each block group's population within the transit district was calculated by using the percentage of address points within
the district and each block group. This address fraction was the factor used to proportion Census counts resulting in demographics within buffers for each service and PnR. Address points come from the USDOT National
Address Database.
* All Minorities include Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, Asian (non-Hispanic), Native American (non-Hispanic), Hawaiian Native and Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic), and Other (Including Mixed Race, non-Hispanic).
** Population totals for the RTD district vary between statistics for race and income/poverty in part due to the fact that the Census is a full count and the ACS is an extrapolation based on a sample, and in part because the
ACS total excludes those whom poverty status is not determined.

2022 Language Access Plan

Limited English Proficiency or Limited English Proficient (LEP): People with limited English proficiency
(LEP) are persons whose primary language is not English and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak or
understand English.
Meaningful access: Language assistance that results in accurate, timely and effective communication at no
cost to the LEP person. For LEP persons, meaningful access denotes access that is not unreasonably restricted,
delayed or inferior as compared to access to programs or activities provided to English proficient persons.
Vital Document: Paper or electronic material that is critical for accessing RTD’s services, programs and
activities or contains information about procedures and processes required by law. Classification of a document
as “vital” depends upon the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and the
consequence to the LEP person if the information in question is not provided accurately or in a timely manner.
Effective communication: Sufficient communication to provide the LEP person with meaningful access to the
services that otherwise are available to the public.
Reasonable steps: Steps taken, or language assistance services provided, to ensure effective communication
with people limited in English (e.g., interpretation services).
Recipient: Any state, political subdivision of any state, or instrumentality of any state; public or private agency,
institution, organization, or other entity; or any individual, in any state, to whom federal financial assistance is
extended, directly or through another recipient.
Safe harbor: The Safe Harbor Provision outlines the circumstances that can provide agencies a safe harbor
regarding the translation of written materials for LEP populations. It stipulates that a grantee is compliant if each
eligible LEP language group has written translation of vital documents in accordance with the Four Factor
Analysis. The LEP Safe Harbor Threshold for language assistance at is 5% of or 1,000 persons in (whichever is
less) the population to be served.

Language Access Plan Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) Language Access Plan (LAP) is to document and
guide the actions that RTD has taken – and will take – to ensure meaningful access to RTD transit programs,
services and activities by people with limited English proficiency (LEP) in accordance with Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166.

2022 Language Access Plan

In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166, the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) is committed to ensuring its diverse community of residents, customers and visitors
can effectively participate in or benefit from its transit services and programs regardless of race, color or national
origin. Importantly, this means that RTD is also responsible for taking reasonable steps to provide customers of
limited English proficiency (LEP) with meaningful access to our services, facilities and programs.1 In some
circumstances, failure to ensure that people with LEP can meaningfully access federally assisted programs or
activities may constitute national origin discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. RTD, as a
recipient of federal financial assistance, has an obligation to reduce language barriers that inhibit meaningful
access by LEP persons to the agency’s services. Consequently, RTD is committed to providing language
assistance not only to comply with the requirements of Title VI, Executive Order 13166 and United States
Department of Transportation (USDOT) LEP Implementing Guidance but also to uphold its own principles of
equitably providing safe, reliable transportation to the community.
This document includes a Four Factor Analysis, as established by USDOT LEP Implementing Guidance, that
assesses the language assistance needs of LEP persons in RTD’s service area. The analysis found that, according
to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 227,262 of the 3.2 million people in the RTD service area (close to
7% of the RTD service area population) speak English “less than very well.” Further, approximately 378,376
persons, or 11.6% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign born; and 646,021 persons, over
19% of the RTD service area population, speak a language other than English at home. Sixty-eight percent of
people with limited English proficiency are Spanish speakers, followed by Vietnamese (4.4%) and Chinese
(4.2%). Supplemented with data from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) as well as other sources including
(but not limited to) Colorado state agencies, the analysis reveals 21 languages that qualify as safe harbor
languages. The focus of RTD’s language assistance measures will thus be on these languages.
Following the Four Factor Analysis, this document establishes RTD’s updated Language Access Plan (LAP) to
guide language assistance measures from 2022 to 2025. After an extensive review of the 2019 LAP, RTD’s LEP
inter-division comprised of Administration, Communications, Operations, Planning and Security recommended a
two-tiered approach to retain and expand upon past language assistance measures to better meet the needs of
people with limited English proficiency. The tiers are as follows:
•

Tier One: Successful Activities to Continue. Tier One will retain existing programs and activities
designed to meet the language needs of regional LEP populations, such as:
o Telephone interpreters in virtually any language;
o Multilingual printed materials and multilingual information on RTD’s website; and
o Continuing development of partnerships with community organizations that serve LEP
populations.

1 Those with LEP are defined by the United States Government as persons whose primary language is not English and who have a

limited ability to read, write, speak or understand English.

Executive Summary

1.D.1.g

2022 Language Access Plan
Tier Two: Activities to Deepen our Focus. Tier Two identifies new areas to further the agency’s goal
of providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs and services. These activities focus
on four primary areas:
1. Updating and monitoring the LAP: how RTD monitors, evaluates and updates the LAP.
This area of focus provides guidance for monitoring and compliance of the LAP, program research,
program administration and primary as well as secondary research to obtain feedback from LEP
populations.
2. Language assistance: how RTD provides language assistance services by language.
This area of focus relates to providing free language assistance for outreach documents and inperson services. It also guides the evaluation of which documents are vital for translation and the
format(s) that most effectively communicate the messages contained in those documents. Lastly,
this area guides how RTD will provide information through customer information channels as well
as conduct culturally responsive outreach.
3. Providing notice of language assistance: how RTD administers notice to LEP persons
about the availability of language assistance. This area of focus provides guidance for
providing notice of language assistance on outreach documents, on the system and providing
notice of the Title VI complaint process.
4. Training programs for personnel: how RTD trains employees to provide timely and
reasonable language assistance to LEP populations. This area of focus provides guidance
for the development of curriculum and the incorporation of LAP information into the employee
environment in order to prepare all front line and other relevant staff to effectively engage and
respond to LEP customers.
In pursuing this two-tiered approach to language access, RTD seeks to better mitigate language barriers that
could prevent LEP customers from accessing the agency’s transit programs and services. It is RTD’s intent that
this approach will allow the agency to more equitably serve the Denver metropolitan region’s diverse
communities, in turn enabling more customers the freedom to get where they want to go.

Introduction
As the Denver metropolitan region’s public transportation provider, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is
committed to its residents, customers and visitors regardless of race, color or national origin. Importantly, this
means RTD is responsible for making reasonable accommodations and removing barriers to accessing those
services for individuals in protected classes – which include people with limited English proficiency (LEP). For
LEP persons, language can act as a barrier to accessing the benefits of RTD’s services, complying with
responsibilities such as payment or safety measures, or understanding other information regarding RTD’s
activities. A commitment to providing language assistance for those with LEP is thus not only required of RTD in
order to comply with federal regulations, but it is also intrinsic to the transit agency’s mission, vision and values

to provide accessible public transportation to all.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Federal Executive Order 13166 and the Department of Transportation's (USDOT)
LEP Guidance together require that agencies which receive federal funding, including RTD, must make
reasonable accommodations for LEP persons. At the core of these requirements is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq., which provides that “no person in the United States shall, on the ground of
race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” While Title VI itself does not
explicitly include language as a protected class, the 1974 Supreme Court case Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563
interpreted Title VI regulations to hold that Title VI prohibits conduct that has a disproportionate effect on LEP
persons, as such conduct would constitute national origin discrimination.
Later, on August 11, 2000, former President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to
Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” which requires recipients of federal financial assistance to
take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services, information and other important
portions of their programs and activities for LEP persons. On December 14, 2005, the U.S. Department of
Transportation published guidance for its recipients to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory
requirements.
To further assist transit agencies, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published the most current Circular
4702.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients” on October 1, 2012. Chapter III Part 9 of
this Circular directs FTA recipients (including RTD) and sub-recipients to:
1. Conduct a Four Factor Analysis;
2. Develop a Language Access Plan (LAP); and
3. Provide appropriate language assistance.
In fulfilling these criteria, transit agencies such as RTD must ensure they are striving to mitigate language
barriers to their programs and services. This report documents RTD's Four Factor Analysis and LAP describing
how RTD will continue to provide meaningful access to its transit services to people with LEP.
RTD’s Commitment to Equity: Progress Made in Language Access
RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections, and its vision is to be “the trusted leader in mobility,
delivering excellence and value to customers and community.” RTD recognizes the role that public transit plays
in achieving mobility for all people, in turn improving their connections to employment opportunities, recreational
activities, health care, housing, social programs and services, and more. For example, as part of its Reimagine
RTD project launched in 2019, RTD’s values are increasingly embracing concepts of transit equity, with an eye
towards providing meaningful access to high-quality public transportation services for a broad and progressively
more diverse community. Improving the accessibility of RTD’s activities, programs and services via language

access is one way to reduce mobility barriers for people with limited English proficiency, in turn making local
public transit more equitable for all.

As concrete evidence to RTD’s commitment to equity and language access, the agency launched its Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis in spring 2022. The study aims to examine RTD’s fares and explore changes to
its fare structure to make its services more equitable, simple and affordable. The agency is conducting the study
in response to customer feedback that RTD’s fares are expensive and complex – complexity that is made worse
when customers may not speak English proficiently. Working towards the desired goals of improved equity and
simplicity will include making RTD’s services more accessible to LEP persons; further, the study itself was
designed to be as supportive of language access as possible. For instance, RTD did the following:
•

Created the study survey in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese (the top four languages in RTD’s
service area);

•

Provided instructions for all safe harbor language customers to translate the English webpage into their
preferred languages;

•

Provided language assistance to participate in the study at no cost;

•

Conducted a customer and community meeting in Spanish; and

•

Worked with 6 multicultural community-based organizations to host focus groups with their constituents.

2022 Language Access Plan

Historically, RTD has made strides to ensure meaningful access to public transportation for LEP persons.
However, as the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis illustrates, the agency can do more to attract
customers who would otherwise be excluded from utilizing services because of language barriers and, ideally,
encourage customers to continue using the system after they are proficient in English or may have more
transportation options.
LAP Monitoring and Updating
USDOT guidance states that recipients should (where appropriate) have a process for determining whether new
documents, programs, services and activities need to be made accessible for LEP persons; RTD does so as part
of its three-year cycle to monitor Title VI compliance and an ongoing basis as changing service area
demographics and service changes warrant. As such, RTD continually monitors demographic information and
engages with community organizations serving LEP persons to remain in tune with those in need of language
assistance.
With a burgeoning focus on equity, RTD sees much room to build upon its existing programs and activities
designed to serve LEP persons and is seeking to expand its historic approach to language access. Firstly, in
2021, RTD established a dedicated outreach program intended to further the implementation of language access
measures. This outreach program is housed in the Civil Rights Division and has a dedicated staff member, the
Transit Equity Specialist (LAP Coordinator), who is assigned to help develop the program, carry out the day-today tasks, coordinate across departments for agency-wide implementation and conduct outreach to LEP persons

and community-based organizations serving these populations. The program is overseen by the Transit Equity
Manager. Further, the Transit Equity Office in RTD’s Civil Rights Division assumed the responsibility to update
RTD’s LAP. Part of the update process included reconvening an inter-departmental workgroup to address federal
language access requirements for LEP populations, restore agency commitment to its language access program
and clarify staff roles and responsibilities. In March 2020, the Transit Equity Office selected staff members
throughout the agency in accordance with their position and asked them to participate in the update process.
Specifically, the workgroup aimed to:
1. Complete a needs assessment of LEP persons in the district. The Four Factor Analysis assessment
(see below) permitted Market Research and Transit Equity staff to identify high concentrations and
frequency of contact of LEP populations, to ascertain the nature as well as the importance of RTD services
and programs and to determine if there were language barriers limiting the access of LEP persons to
RTD services.
2. Develop the LAP, including its Guidelines Index and 2022-2025 Implementation Schedule.
This undertaking provides a framework for the provision of timely and reasonable language assistance
to those with limited English proficiency who access RTD’s services as well as a method to evaluate and
review the effectiveness of a LAP.
Staff members from the Transit Equity Office developed a work plan with designated tasks and timelines to help
the inter-departmental workgroup complete the LAP update in a timely manner. This process allowed for a
methodical, focused approach to the assessment; it also defined deliverables, assigned tasks and clarified roles
and responsibilities. The following Four Factor Analysis and updated LAP are products from that work.

Overview of the Four Factor Analysis
Per the USDOT LEP Guidance, transit providers must determine the language assistance needs of the LEP
persons they are likely to serve by utilizing a Four Factor Analysis. The assessment involves the following factors:
1.

The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by an RTD
program, activity or service;

2.

The frequency with which LEP persons interact with RTD programs, activities or services;

3.

The nature and importance of programs or services provided by RTD to the LEP population; and

4.

The resources available to RTD and overall cost to provide language assistance.

RTD has conducted the Four Factor Analysis using a combination of market research resources which consists
of an evaluation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, engagement with RTD staff, consultation with Colorado
state agencies, consultation with community organizations and direct interactions with people limited in English
proficiency. The results of this analysis will be used as the criteria for the development of language assistance
measures employed by RTD.

2022 Language Access Plan

The first step in conducting the Four Factor Analysis is to assess the number or proportion of people with LEP
who are eligible to be served or encountered by RTD. The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) gives RTD a reliable baseline of the safe harbor languages2 within the RTD boundaries.3 According to the
ACS, of the 3.2 million people in the RTD service area, approximately 227,262, close to 7% of the RTD service
area population, speaks English “less than very well.”4 The following points identify other notable findings from
the assessment of the number and proportion of LEP persons in the RTD service area:
•

Approximately 378,376 persons, 11.6% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign born.5

•

Approximately 646,021 persons, over 19% of the RTD service area population, speak a language other
than English at home.

•

North and Northeast Denver, East Lakewood and Northwest, North, and Northeast Aurora have the
highest concentrations of people with LEP, containing multiple census tracts with more than 2,000 LEP
persons.

American Community Survey (ACS)
The figures below display those LEP populations, by language, that meet the LEP safe harbor language threshold
(5% of the service area population or 1,000 people that are likely to be served by RTD, whichever is less). Spanish
is by far the most frequently spoken language at home other than English, accounting for more than 68% of
the LEP population. Excluding the grouped categories of “Other Asian/Pacific Island Languages” and “Other
Indo-European Languages,” the second- and third-most languages spoken at home are Vietnamese and Chinese
(comprising 4.4% and 4.2% of the LEP population, respectively).

The Safe Harbor Provision outlines the circumstances that can provide agencies a safe harbor regarding the translation of
written materials for LEP populations. It stipulates that a grantee is compliant if each eligible LEP language group has
written translation of vital documents in accordance with the Four Factor Analysis. The LEP Safe Harbor Threshold for
language assistance at is 5% of or 1,000 persons in (whichever is less) the population to be served.

RTD estimated district boundaries using the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates at the Census Tract
level. RTD analyzed all Census Tracts required to include all 8 counties RTD has services in: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and Weld Counties.

three most popular spoken languages other than English: Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese.67 This data
illustrates that the highest populations of all LEP speakers concentrate in North and Northeast Denver; East
Lakewood; and Northwest, North and Northeast Aurora. Variations exist between LEP speakers of different
languages, however. For instance, concentrations of LEP Vietnamese and Chinese speakers are more likely to
be dispersed across the outer portions of RTD’s service area, where LEP Spanish speakers are more likely to
concentrate in the Metropolitan Denver urban core.

In addition to considering the ACS and PUMS estimates, RTD’s Factor 1 analysis examined the most recent data
on the Student Language Spoken at Home from the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) for the 2020-2021
school year, which includes students ranging from kindergarten to high school. It is assumed that if children are
identified as speaking a language other than English at home, then their parents or adult guardians are likely to
speak the same language. While this data set does not identify the number of people above the school age that
speak a language other than English, it can be a helpful complement to U.S. Census data.
Data were compiled from the following school districts serving students within the RTD district boundaries.8

WIC data corroborates PUMS findings that Amharic, Nepali, Somali and Swahili should also be paid attention in
language assistance measures. It also found that two other languages that had not appeared in other data sets
– specifically, Burmese and Tigrinya – are spoken at WIC Clinics. However, given their low prevalence in ACS
and PUMS findings, RTD has omitted them from consideration of the current list of safe harbor languages.

From Factor 1 of RTD’s Four Factor Analysis, RTD can draw crucial conclusions about which languages should
be prioritized in language assistance measures and where such measures are most needed geographically. First
and foremost, Factor 1 allows RTD to establish a list of 21 safe harbor languages to guide language assistance.
These languages are (in alphabetical order):
1. Amharic

12. Laotian

2. Arabic

13. Nepali (Nepalese)

3. Chinese (Simplified)

14. Russian

4. Farsi (Persian)

15. Somali

5. French (European)

16. Spanish (Mexico)

6. German

17. Swahili

7. Hindi

18. Tagalog (Filipino)

8. Hmong

19. Telugu

9. Japanese

20. Thai

10. Khmer (Cambodian)

21. Vietnamese

Ensuring that Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese – as the most common languages spoken by people with limited
English proficiency – receive attention when it comes to translation of vital documents, interpretation and other
language efforts is especially important. While RTD has done some work to provide assistance for Spanish
speakers, and resources such as telephone interpreters give support in other languages (see Language
Assistance Measures Employed by RTD for more detail), much work remains to expand upon Spanish language
access as well as establishing a more solid foundation in other languages.

Data from Factor 1 also allow RTD to most strategically pursue language assistance measures based on the
spatial concentrations of LEP populations. Transit routes and other activities located near high concentrations
of LEP (specifically, North and Northeast Denver; East Lakewood; and Northwest, North and Northeast Aurora)
warrant the most attention to language access.

2022 Language Access Plan

Following Factor 1, Factor 2 in the USDOT LEP Guidance requires RTD to assess, as accurately as possible, the
frequency with which the agency interacts with LEP persons from different language groups. The more frequent
the contact, the more likely enhanced language services will be needed. Consequently, the reasonable language
assistance measures that RTD takes to serve a rarely encountered LEP population (e.g., Ilocano) will be very
different than those taken for an LEP population that is encountered daily (e.g., Spanish).
To complete the Factor 2 assessment and understand the frequency of contact RTD has with people of limited
English proficiency, RTD conducted surveys with frontline employees who interact with customers. RTD also
collected the following data sources:
•

Frontline employee survey data

•

Customer satisfaction survey data

•

Telephone information center data

•

Access-a-Ride call data

•

Website visitation data

Frontline Employee Data
Since frontline staff are often the first contact LEP community members have with RTD, RTD sought to answer
the following questions (among others):
•

How often do frontline employees interact with LEP customers, and where do these interactions take
place?

•

What types of questions do LEP customers ask frontline employees?

•

Do frontline employees have difficulty communicating with people limited in English?

•

Are frontline employees aware of materials, services or tools that RTD uses to communicate with people
limited in English?

•

Are there additional materials, services or tools RTD can use to improve communications?

•

What can RTD do to better prepare frontline employees to assist LEP customers?

The survey closed on June 13, 2021 with 614 responses, including 141 responses to the online version and 473
responses to the paper version.
The survey found that almost all frontline employees interact with community members a few times per week
or more (96%), with 76% interacting with community members every day. While interactions with LEP
populations were less frequent than those proficient in English, 67% of frontline employees interacted with LEP
people a few times per week, with 1 in 4 (26%) reporting daily interaction with LEP people.

To help better communicate with LEP customers, frontline staff recommend that RTD provide more translated
materials (e.g., brochures, announcements, signage, cards with translations of common phrases, fare
information, and schedule information), a translation device, a direct phone line for translation services, and
language classes for the most frequently encountered languages.

Hiring more bilingual frontline employees could also prove useful.

RTD’s Telephone Information Center (TIC) is one of many ways RTD fulfills its commitment to providing quality
customer service to all its potential transit users. RTD’s TIC has 27 full-time Information Specialists answering
incoming calls from customers requesting route information, filing complaints and making suggestions and
comments for response by e-mail, telephone or mail.13
Presently, TIC experiences a limited demand for language assistance. TIC does accommodate LEP Spanish
speakers by staffing 11 full-time bilingual Information Specialists; however, the demand for language assistance
from Spanish speakers seems low, given the proportion of LEP Spanish speakers in the RTD service area. To
illustrate, in the period of April 2021 to March 2022 (the 12 months prior to drafting this LAP), the TIC received
565,500 calls, with only 18,610 (3.29%) of those calls requiring language assistance for Spanish speakers.

Access-a-Ride Call Data
RTD’s Access-a-Ride has 21 full-time reservationists answering incoming calls from customers requesting Accessa-Ride trips. Presently, the service has experienced limited demand for language assistance. The Access-a-Ride
Call Center, operated by First Transit, began utilizing phone interpretation services, May 2021. Since May 2021,
out of a total of 154,874 incoming calls, 135 (0.087%) requested Spanish interpretation. 4 (0.003%) calls were
for Mandarin and 3 (0.002%) were for Russian.
RTD Website Visitation Data
In 2021 we had a total of 32 million page views, 9.2 million sessions, and 3.6 million users on the RTD website
(www.RTD-denver.com).
RTD can track the default language of a visitor to the agency’s website, providing some indication of the amount
of default device or “in-browser” translation. For example, operating systems such as Apple support localized
translations in dozens of languages so that users can automatically display content in the language of their
choice on their device. Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge also offer in-browser
translations, giving users the opportunity to translate information while surfing the web.
Below is a percentage breakdown of the top 10 languages used by our visitors from January 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Most website visitors view the RTD website in English (97.5% of the 3.6 million total users); visitors
who translate the website from English into their preferred language account for less than 2.5% of total visitors,
excluding crawlers (bots).

To further assist in website translation, RTD has historically offered the Google Translate widget. However,
Google deprecated the widget in 2019 and, consequently, will no longer update it. While RTD will continue to
offer the widget to website visitors in the short-term, it will eventually be removed as it becomes increasingly
outdated.
Summary
Factor 2 in the Four Factor Analysis helps ascertain in what mediums language assistance is most needed. Data
collected from the frontline employee survey, customer satisfaction survey, telephone information center,
Access-a-Ride telephone and the website especially show how important it is to improve language assistance in
locations where frontline staff are likely to have face-to-face interactions with people limited in English, such as
on transit vehicles or at a stop. Improving language accessibility for trip planning information, fares, schedules
or ticket purchases seems to be the most important, given that these are the types of questions frontline staff
report receiving the most from LEP persons. Further, staff largely note that it is difficult to communicate with
customers limited in English, suggesting that more translated announcements, signage, cards with common
words/phrases, brochures and schedules; a translation device; a direct phone line for translation services; and
language classes for the most frequently encountered languages would help them better serve LEP people. They
are also unfamiliar with the language assistance services RTD does offer, so bolstering staff training on these
services is also important.

It is unclear whether the low quantity of telephone requests and website visits in other languages is due to low
demand or other factors. For instance, people limited in English may not know the telephone lines or website
exist in the first place, they may not have ready access to a computer or (smart)phone or they may be hesitant
to use them given real and perceived language barriers. Expanding notice of available language assistance

Factor 3: Nature and Importance of RTD
Services, Programs and Activities
Factor 3 of USDOT’s Four Factor Analysis requires RTD to assess the nature and importance of programs,
activities or services provided by RTD to people with limited English proficiency. To complete Factor 3, RTD’s
LAP workgroup conducted surveys with LEP people who use RTD services. The workgroup sought to answer the
following research questions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

How frequently do LEP customers interact with RTD?
How do LEP customers receive RTD specific information and how do they prefer to receive information?
How useful are RTD’s language assistance services?
What is the importance of receiving RTD information in their native language?
How safe and secure do LEP customers feel?
Are LEP customers aware of RTD’s LiVE program?
How do LEP customers perceive RTD’s fare system?
What are LEP customers’ demographics?

RTD conducted a survey from September 7, 2021 through October 31, 2021 to answer the aforementioned
questions. Surveys were distributed to LEP persons in collaboration with numerous community-based
organizations. Due to lower-than-expected response rates, RTD created a social media campaign to target LEP
persons. RTD offered the survey in both a paper and online format, and it was translated into Amharic, Arabic,
Chinese, English, French, Korean, Nepalese, Persian, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.
The survey closed on October 31, 2021 with 206 responses, including 101 responses to the online version and
105 responses to the paper version. During data collection efforts, RTD collected responses from many people
who do not classify as LEP. Their responses were analyzed for potential skews and were deemed too biased to
be included in the analysis. Over half (58%) of respondents speak Spanish as their native language, followed by
Vietnamese (7%), Chinese (6%) and Nepalese (5%). Almost all respondents either read, write or understand
English less than “very well” (87%, 90%, and 88%, respectively).
Concerning the frequency of their interactions with RTD services, the survey found that 1 in 4 survey respondents
use RTD daily, with 59% using transit once a week or more. Most respondents (70%) had used RTD prior to
the global COVID-19 pandemic. Half of respondents state they use RTD the same now as they did prior to the
pandemic; about a third of respondents state they ride RTD less now than they did prior to the pandemic.

Further, access to information has implications for feelings of security. Two in three respondents have felt their
security was at risk while using RTD services at some point, but not everyone reported knowing what to do in
case of an emergency. Most respondents (69%) know how to follow emergency exit instructions or call RTD

Summary
Though the survey used in RTD’s Factor 3 analysis only gathered input from a relatively small percent of RTD’s
LEP community, it is still illustrative of the nature and important of RTD’s various services and activities for
people with LEP. Firstly, it demonstrates the high, frequent usage of RTD’s services among the LEP population
surveyed, and thus reinforces the importance of pursuing reasonable language access measures. It also helps
demonstrate which materials, in which format and on what subjects RTD should offer language assistance. The
website is noted as a very important source of information for people with LEP. While Factor II found that little
translation of the website is performed, RTD recognizes that in-browser translations are not captured by the
Factor 2 data. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to at least offer instructions in various languages on how to
change one’s in-browser language on the RTD homepage. Signage at transit stops and in transit vehicles is also
an important source of information for people with LEP. Interestingly, while only 7% of survey respondents
showed that they get information from RTD via its social media platforms, 15% would prefer to receive
information from RTD via these channels. Examining the prevalence of language assistance on social media as
well as expanding advertising of RTD’s various social media networks could be a valuable endeavor to meet
community members’ preferences.

It is important to note that 1 in 5 survey respondents do not receive information about RTD. Thus, in addition
to better advertising RTD’s social media platforms, RTD could also prioritize providing language access to expand
awareness of RTD’s various outlets for information, including its email listserv, service alerts, Transit Watch app
and beyond.
Finally, in providing language assistance, RTD should focus on the information that people with LEP need the
most. This survey indicates that topics of priority should be purchasing fares (and costs of fares), routes and

Factor 4: Available Resources and Costs of
Providing Language Assistance Services
The final factor in the USDOT’s Four Factor Analysis is to examine the overall cost and resources available to
RTD to provide language assistance. RTD’s LAP inter-departmental workgroup conducted this assessment.
As this Plan has mentioned, it is RTD’s intention to maintain current language assistance measures that have
proven successful while also expanding upon those efforts in the coming years. A good place to begin
understanding what our resources are (and could be) to support expanded language efforts is to analyze
expenditures for language assistance in recent years. This will provide us a baseline from which we can better
analyze costs and resources moving forward.
The analysis shows that RTD spent approximately $176,000 on language assistance measures including
telephone interpretation, literature translation, vehicle signage and more (see Figure 36).

navigation information, and service changes and alerts. Language-accessible safety information is also crucial to
the well-being of people limited in English proficiency, as many participants have felt their safety has been at
risk while using RTD but did not know what to do about it (e.g., by reporting an incident on the Transit Watch
app). All in all, this survey should be helpful in determining what information, its format, and its location are
considered vital for translation and should be targeted for other important language access measures.

* Not including staff labor
A more complete explanation of these language assistance measures can be found in the next section.
What is not accounted for in this approximate total is the staff costs incurred to provide language access. Various
staff from Communications, Bus and Rail Operations, Access-a-Ride, Planning, Service Planning and Transit
Equity are often involved in these efforts, as RTD strives to find creative ways to address the diverse customer
base it serves. Further, these numbers do not quantify the cost of staff regularly providing their language skills
to assist community members with LEP (for instance, 1 in 4 frontline RTD staff who regularly interact with people
limited in English proficiency speak a foreign language).
Summary
It is clear that RTD has an opportunity to determine what resources it needs and those that are available to the
agency as it expands its language access efforts. The agency is already on its way to doing so by establishing
an official language access outreach program, housed within the Transit Equity Office of the Civil Rights Division.
With the support of the Transit Equity Specialist (a dedicated LAP coordinator) and overseen by the Transit
Equity Manager, the outreach program will begin to establish the “people power” and formalize language access
work into dedicated staff time. In this manner, RTD will be better able to determine what resources the agency
requires and has available to it for expanded language access, not only including tangible resources such as
funding but also intangible ones like community partnerships.

Translation of Vital Documents
Agencies receiving federal funding are required to identify “vital documents” that must be translated to the
extent possible. Vital documents are defined as 1) any document critical for obtaining services and benefits,
and/or 2) any document required by law. In other words, whether or not a document (or the information it
solicits) is “vital” depends on the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and
the consequence to the LEP person if the information in question is not accurate or timely disseminated. For
instance, applications for a bicycle safety course would not generally be considered vital, although summaries
of major service changes are vital documents. Other vital documents include but are not limited to:
•

Title VI public notice

•

Title VI complaint procedures

•

Bus and rail schedules

•

Summaries and notices of public hearings regarding proposed:
o

Transportation plans

o

Service impacting construction activities

RTD has consistently worked with community organizations and the LEP populations the serve to evaluate which
documents are “vital” to the meaningful access to RTD services and programs. However, with the 2022-2025
Language Access Plan update, the LAP inter-departmental workgroup now has clearly defined tiers (1,2 and 3)
to determine if documents are considered vital and to guide translation efforts. Find more information in 20222025 Language Access Plan Guidelines and Implementation Calendar.

2022-2025 Language Access Plan Guidelines
and Implementation Calendar
After a review of the 2021 Four Factor Analysis results, the LAP inter-departmental workgroup recommended a
two-tiered approach to meeting the needs of LEP populations in RTD’s service area. Tier One retains successful
programs and activities designed to meet the language needs of LEP populations. Tier Two outlines areas of
focus to expand upon the agency’s goal of providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs
and services.
Tier 1: LEP Activities
Tier One retains existing programs and activities designed to meet the language needs of
regional LEP populations, such as telephone interpreters in virtually any language, multi-lingual printed materials
and multi-lingual information on the RTD website or brochures, and continuing development of partnerships
with community organizations that serve people with limited English proficiency.
Specifically, the following activities will continue (as noted in Language Assistance Measures Employed by RTD
above):
•

Providing telephone interpreters via customer service at 303-299-6000 and via the Access-a-Ride Call
Center at 303-292-6560 to assist LEP customers

Area of Focus 1: Updating and Monitoring the LAP
rtd-denver.com

53
Packet Pg. 125

1.D.1.g

This area of focus shores up RTD’s LAP updating and monitoring process by developing the necessary systems
to more efficiently and effectively determine language assistance needs. In addition to ensuring compliance with
Title VI and DOT LEP Guidance, this area will see RTD building out processes (e.g., staff roles, community
evaluation tool and more) to guarantee that language assistance is available where needed, establishing and
solidifying relationships with organizations and community members to inform the LAP, creating a uniform file
management system for language assistance needs and translated documents, and otherwise formalizing a
strategic foundation for pursuing language access.
Area of Focus 2: Language Assistance
Where Area of Focus 1 focuses on how RTD monitors, evaluates and updates its language access program itself,
Area of Focus 2 dials in on the actual provision of language assistance. For instance, activities will include creating
a planning process for hosting an in-person interpreter at events, ensuring certain information like trip planning
or purchasing fares is language-accessible, providing interpretation for basic transit questions, creating updated
versions of How to Ride videos in identified languages and more.
Specifically, as mentioned in Language Assistance Measures Employed by RTD, RTD will be fortifying its
processes for translating vital documents. In identifying documents needed to provide meaningful access to RTD
services for LEP customers, RTD has defined three levels of vital documents. This will allow for prioritization of
materials translation as resources allow. In some cases, translation of vital documents may consist of only a
summary or key points. For other vital documents, providing notice of available language assistance can also
provide sufficient access.
The 3 tiers can be described as follows:
1. Tier 1 – Safety, Security and Civil Rights. Information categorized in Tier 1 is that which protects
customers’ physical safety and facilitates RTD customers to exercise their legal rights. Providing translation
or LEP-accessible versions of this type of information is the highest priority of all vital documents.
Information categorized as Tier 1 would be found within (but would not be all-inclusive of) the following
information types identified in Factor 3: Safety and Security, and Rights Notices. Information about public
hearings and public involvement opportunities related to Fare Information, Service Changes and Planning
Information are also classified as Tier 1 vital documents. Customer surveys related to Tier 1 will be
considered Tier 1 documents.
2. Tier 2 – Information Critical to Access RTD’s Services. Tier 2 includes information that helps LEP
customers to understand RTD services to facilitate ease of use and to understand RTD programs to facilitate
participation. These types of information are critical for LEP-access because they provide more details about
specific benefits available or details of RTD services or programs. Information categorized as Tier 2 would
be found within (but would not be all-inclusive of) the following information types identified in Factor 3:
basic customer information, fare payment information, program applications, maps, service changes, service
alerts, and destination information. Customer surveys related to Tier 2 will be considered Tier 2 documents.

LEP customers to understand and participate with RTD at higher level. This includes information that can
empower customers to play a larger role in contributing to long-term service decisions or use RTD for
recreational activities. Information categorized as Tier 3 would be found within (but would not be allinclusive of) the following information types identified in Factor 3: Project Updates, Planning Information
and Destination Information. Customer surveys related to Tier 3 information will be considered Tier 3
documents.

2022 Language Access Plan
RTD will also consistently work with community organizations and the LEP populations the serve to evaluate
which documents are “vital” to the meaningful access to RTD services and programs.

Area of Focus 3 is predominantly about how RTD communicates to people limited in English about their options
to receive language assistance, as advertising the availability of language assistance services will be key to
ensuring people with limited English proficiency are able to meaningfully access RTD services. RTD will strategize
how to best notify LEP communities of available language assistance by strategically posting signage at all major
passenger transfer stations, RTD’s administrative offices and other RTD properties with high volumes of
pedestrian traffic. The agency is also considering how to make a dedicated “brand” or cohesive theme around
the language assistance services it offers to make them more identifiable and uniform. Furthermore, RTD will
utilize its website and the relationships developed with community organizations that predominantly serve people
limited in English to better market available language assistance services.
Area of Focus 4: Training Programs for Personnel
LEP DOT Guidance states that RTD employees should know their obligations to provide meaningful access to
information and services for LEP persons, and all employees in public contact positions should be properly
trained. In 2022-2025, and in accordance with Guideline 4, RTD intends to fortify staff training to ensure that:
•

Staff know about LEP policies, procedures and resources; and

•

Public-facing staff are trained to work effectively with in-person and telephone interpreters.

As noted in the Four Factor Analysis, RTD mainly encounters LEP persons by way of its local bus service. In
2022, RTD’s Transit Equity Office will launch “Serving Limited English Proficiency Customers” training courses to
educate and provide general skills to all frontline staff for interacting with LEP customers.
It’s reasonable to anticipate that more complex interaction with people limited in English will occur with telephone
information specialists, receptionists, sales outlets associates, transit security and other frontline staff. These
frontline employees will have more detailed procedures and sophisticated tools for managing interactions with
LEP persons to include, but not limited to:
•

Third-party telephone or video remote interpreters

•

“Basic Spanish for Transit” employee books

•

RTD LEP handout guide

•

U.S. Census “I Speak” cards

•

RTD looks forward to implementing the 2022-2025 Language Access Plan by first producing the strategic and
procedural foundation for expanding language access (Area of Focus 1) as well as immediately working to
increase awareness of the language assistance measures the agency already provides (Area of Focus 3).
Fortunately, the agency has already created a solid base from which to pursue this plan by establishing its LAP
outreach program, hiring on the Transit Equity Specialist to coordinate LAP-related work, finalizing the
Implementation Calendar and Guidelines Index as included above, and more. An immediate next step will be to
write the charters that guide each of RTD’s language assistance activities in their purpose, practice,
responsibility, approach and procedure. From there, RTD looks forward to taking real action on improving
language access across the agency’s public transportation system, in turn making local transit more accessible
and equitable for residents, customers and visitors alike.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
August 2022 Service Change Proposals

Committee Meeting Date:
May 11, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, the August 2022
Service Change Proposal facilitates opportunities for bus and rail operators to vote new work
assignments and for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for the
transit network.
The service change process, though contractually required, is an opportunity for the agency to update its
transit services, utilizing projected available resources. Since April 19, 2020, RTD has operated a level of
service reflective of the impacts of COVID 19. As the community and the country move forward from
the various mandates and emergency policies that have affected commerce and mobility, challenges to
workforce availability persist. Like many service-related entities, the transit industry has seen workforce
availability greatly reduced. Recognizing the agency’s reduced level of available transit operators and
mechanics, efforts to update service plans continue to be focused on providing customers with
sustainable and reliable service within available resources.
The service proposals herein are a combination of schedule adjustments and restoration of seasonal
services previously suspended during summer 2022. Efforts to increase operator availability through
recruitment incentives and increased employee outreach continue, though current levels do not support a
substantial increase to service at this time. Additionally, the recently adopted CBA is anticipated to have
positive impacts on both employee retention and recruitment.
DISCUSSION
In regularly implementing service changes to meet customers’ and communities’ needs while considering
available staff resources, RTD demonstrates its commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership. Recognizing the agency’s existing workforce
challenges, the proposals herein are intended to improve on-time performance, maintain CBA compliance
and adjust service levels to match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
