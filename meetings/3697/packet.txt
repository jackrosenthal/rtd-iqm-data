BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update

September 18, 2024

PRESENTATION LENGTH
25 minutes
BACKGROUND
In November 2004, Colorado voters approved the Regional Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Plan
(Plan), thereby authorizing a sales and use tax increase to fund the comprehensive program to construct
and operate new rail lines and improve elements of bus rapid transit (BRT), bus service, and park-n-rides
throughout the region. The Northwest Rail (NWR) is a 45-mile segment of the Plan.
The initial six miles of the NWR are currently in operation as the B Line from Denver to Westminster,
with the remaining 39 miles yet to be constructed. Between 2010 and 2021, RTD completed an
Environmental Evaluation (EE) Study and the Northwest Area Mobility Study and continually gathered
input from local transportation partners and NWR jurisdictional partners in an effort to identify possible
solutions for implementation of the Northwest Rail service. Based on this input, the peak service concept
emerged as a community-preferred alternative with the goal to minimize overall project costs. Under this
proposal, RTD would provide limited rail service along the corridor during weekday morning and evening
commute times.
In order to develop an updated common set of facts, on April 6, 2021, the Board of Directors granted
initial approval for staff to conduct the NWR Peak Service Feasibility Study (PSFS) to solidify project
scope, impacts, and costs.
On August 24, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) to
transfer $8,000,000 from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to fund the PSFS and to enter
into all required contracts to complete the study within the Board-approved budget. In April 2022, RTD
provided notice to proceed to a consulting firm to assist RTD in the planning, engineering, and outreach
efforts for the PSFS.
With the Board’s authorization, staff, supported by a consulting team and jurisdictional stakeholders,
conducted a comprehensive NWR PSFS, which resulted in an independent assessment of a plan to
operate weekday commuter rail service at peak times, with three trips between Longmont and Denver
during the morning and three trips between Denver and Longmont in the evening peak periods. The

Packet Pg. 3

B.1

study assessed the feasibility of a peak service scenario, identified viable vehicle technologies, fleet and
infrastructure needs, lifecycle costing, risk and mitigation strategies, operational rights within the BNSF
railway corridor, and independent capital and operating cost estimates. The study includes extensive,
robust community outreach.
The PSFS supports the first phase of the commitment to deliver NWR as outlined in the 2004 FasTracks
plan and assess the potential future integration of NWR and intercity rail service with Front Range
Passenger Rail (FRPR) from Boulder to Longmont.
The Study was conducted through a five-milestone process:
• Milestone 1 – Peak Service Concept
• Milestone 2 – Corridor Conditions
• Milestone 3 – Base Configuration
• Milestone 4 – Peak Service Expansion Concepts
• Milestone 5 – Project Delivery and Implementation Concepts
Milestones 1 and 2 were fact-finding efforts to understand peak service requirements and to research
and document local plans and commitments that have been made along the corridor since the EE was
conducted by RTD in 2010. Milestone 3 defined the infrastructure requirements and costs for
implementing Peak Service on the NWR corridor. In Milestone 4 the study explored possible expansion
concepts to peak service, while Milestone 5 discussed concepts for project delivery and implementation
of peak service.
Milestones 1 through 5 are now complete.
On September 12, 2023, the PSFS study team provided a progress update to the Finance and Planning
Committee. The progress update included on overview of the project and base configuration elements,
then current status update, community outreach efforts, and next steps.
The study team presented a progress update during the March 26, 2024, Board Meeting. The Board
updated included updates on the project status, required infrastructure, common set of facts, potential
opportunities with the FRPR District, and community outreach efforts.
DISCUSSION
In conducting the PSFS, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic Priorities of
Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success.
The purpose of this discussion item is to update the Board regarding the findings of the PSFS. Since the
March 26, 2024, Board update, the PSFS study team:
• Worked with BNSF towards the development of 30% design plans to identify required
infrastructure to operate passenger service on freight tracks
• Continued station design development in collaboration with the Northwest area stakeholders and
the FRPR District (where applicable)

•
•

Continued identification and analysis of the common set of facts including BNSF agreements,
operating specifications, infrastructure needed, ridership, and capital and operating cost estimates
Identified required railroad agreements for operating peak service on existing freight tracks

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item. The study remains within the original
approved budget.

WHAT IS NORTHWEST RAIL?

In 2004, Denver area voters approved the
FasTracks regional transit system. Since that time,
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has
completed much, but not all, of the FasTracks
plan. Northwest Rail represents approximately
two-thirds of the unfinished mileage from
the FasTracks Plan. RTD refers to the four
remaining projects as “unfinished corridors”
in the FasTracks plan. This study evaluates the
feasibility of completing the Northwest Rail
Project with a reduced level of service from the
original proposal. Previous studies of Northwest
Rail identified high costs, low ridership and
modest benefits as obstacles to receiving Federal
project funding.
The Northwest Rail corridor is a 45-mile corridor from Denver
Union Station (DUS) to Longmont. Six miles of Northwest
Rail were completed in 2016 and now operate as the B Line
between DUS and Westminster Station as seen in Figure 1.
Due to a lack of sufficient funding, the remaining portion of
the corridor has not been completed. Since the passing of
FasTracks by voters, RTD has continued to evaluate options for
completing the Northwest Rail project. As originally envisioned,
RTD has focused primarily on options that would operate on
existing BNSF-owned freight tracks. This contrasts with other
RTD commuter rail corridors, including the current B Line, which
operate on new tracks built exclusively for passenger service.
Although this option is lower in cost, operating on the freight
railroad system, especially as a continuation of an existing RTD
commuter rail corridor, introduces complex operational issues.
The proposed service would use existing freight tracks, which is
unique to RTD; however, many commuter rail services operate
on freight tracks throughout the country. Another unique aspect
to RTD is that this proposal would extend existing passenger
service on an electrified rail line to a non-electrified rail line
where passenger service is not currently offered. This scenario
adds both safety and regulatory challenges in assessing the
feasibility of Northwest Rail passenger service.

Working with local stakeholders, RTD developed a Peak
Service Concept for initial service in the corridor. The
Peak Service Concept provides rail service between
Longmont and Denver serving six new stations and all
existing B Line stations.
RTD engaged extensively with two additional
stakeholders in this study: BNSF Railway and the Front
Range Passenger Rail District (FRPRD), a new entity
created to develop intercity rail along the Front Range.
Working closely with BNSF allowed this study to address
costs and regulatory requirements. CDOT and FRPRD are
concurrently developing an intercity rail plan for service
between Fort Collins and Pueblo that will share the same
Northwest Corridor between Denver and Longmont. The
Peak Service Feasibility Study (the Study) focuses on the
Peak Service Concept, while the intercity rail plan has
other objectives. RTD and FRPRD have been working
closely together on these two separate studies. The
information revealed in the Study and intercity rail plan
will help inform ongoing discussions for rail service in the
corridor and help inform decisions for broader passenger
rail service along the Front Range.

NORTHWEST RAIL PEAK SERVICE FEASIBILITY STUDY

PEAK SERVICE CONCEPT
The Peak Service Concept assessed
in this study consists of three
southbound morning peak trips from
Longmont to Denver Union Station
and three northbound trips on the
same route during the evening peak
period each weekday.

THE STUDY OBJECTIVE

In 2022, the RTD Board of Directors
authorized the Study to respond to
stakeholder input on how RTD might complete
its 2004 FasTracks Plan by assessing an
initial commuter rail service in the Northwest
Corridor. The Study advances the concept
brought forward from local stakeholders and
RTD staff with a specific focus on developing
a Common Set of Facts to inform the RTD
Board of possible next steps.
The Project Team, composed of RTD staff and a consulting
team, engaged local jurisdictions, stakeholders and the
public along the corridor to define and resolve key issues,
including station configurations and concept designs as
well as the impacts that new rail service would have on the
local environment and community. The Project Team also
engaged with BNSF to identify initial design requirements
and address how RTD and BNSF would operate service on
the same tracks.

The Peak Service Feasibility Study was completed in
five stages, each with a major report:
] Milestone 1: Confirm and refine the Peak Service
Concept with stakeholders
] Milestone 2: Identify local, state, federal, and
BNSF requirements for the operation of service
(the “Base Configuration”)
] Milestone 3: Conduct initial planning and develop
preliminary engineering design and costs required to
build and operate the Base Configuration service

B.1.b

What is the Peak Service Concept?

Major Challenges
and Constraints
] Level boarding at new high platform
stations on a freight corridor must match
RTD’s existing station configuration and
meet accessibility requirements.
] The existing BNSF corridor lacks
sufficient clearance for overhead
electrification, precluding service using
RTD’s existing fleet.
] RTD must obtain agreement from BNSF
on operating conditions and infrastructure
required to operate passenger service on
tracks shared with freight trains.

Track Improvements
] Tracks must be upgraded to allow for
passenger service to operate with a
competitive travel time.

Fleet Maintenance
and Storage
] A new commuter rail maintenance and
storage facility is required near the
northern end of the line.

Fleet Requirements
] A train that can operate on both RTD and
BNSF territory results in a small fleet size
unique to this corridor.
] A high floor train is required for
accessibile level boarding at high
platforms.
] A commonly available fleet type used
by another transit agency is strongly
preferred to reduce purchase and longterm maintenance costs.

Station Locations
] The general station locations were
established for the Study. The Study Team
worked with stakeholders to define the
preferred location and configuration of
proposed stations.
] The exact location and configuration of
stations in Boulder and Louisville will be
addressed in future phases to resolve
a conflict between planned locations
and platform accessibility with BNSF
operations.

Attachment: Final NWR-PSS Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The Project Team began the Study with the basic service concept defined by stakeholders and
the Board. The Peak Service Concept is illustrated in Figure 2. The next step for the Project
Team was to identify corridor challenges, regulatory constraints, infrastructure requirements, fleet
options, station site plans, platform configurations, concept designs, costs, benefits, and impacts
of providing the service.

] A layover yard for storing and light
maintenance of trains during the
midday period is required when they
are not in service.

What is BNSF’s role?

The BNSF Railway owns the tracks within the Northwest Corridor as part of its Front Range
Subdivision and operates approximately five daily freight trains on this route. As part of this study,
the Study Team and BNSF worked together to identify the requirements to operate passenger
service on the freight tracks.

] Generalized service schedule, including
the number of train trips
] Track improvements and connections,
including those improvements required
to achieve RTD’s travel time goals and
sidings to meet BNSF’s freight needs
] Station locations and configurations,
including station sidings
] Safety, signaling, dispatch, and other
operational and regulatory requirements
] General cost of improvements based on
preliminary engineering plans

How would
Peak Service
operate?

RTD specified 65 minutes, plus
or minus two minutes, as the
desired travel time between DUS
and Longmont to be competitive
with private vehicle commute
times in the corridor. The three
peak period trains would operate
on 30-minute intervals and would
require just under two hours of
dedicated passenger service time
to operate in each peak direction
on the BNSF portion of the track.
For simplicity, RTD identified a
three-hour time block during
each peak period that would
provide operational separation
and potentially allow for a modest
expansion of passenger service
within the time block. Figure 3
illustrates the time block concept.

to implement Northwest Rail

Through this cooperative process between the Study Team and BNSF staff, but subject to approval
by higher-level decisionmakers at both RTD and BNSF, general agreement was reached on most
major service and infrastructure issues:

Although key decisions remain open about which entity will operate and maintain trains, BNSF, as track
owner, will provide rail maintenance, communications, train dispatch, and rail-related safety systems
within its corridor. RTD’s rail operator, Denver Transit Operators (DTO), already provides those functions
on the existing B Line, and the transition between the two track sections will require a well-defined
procedure as trains move between the BNSF- and DTO-operated portions of the corridor.

The Common Set of Facts
describes the mutual
understanding reached in
the Study between RTD,
BNSF, and local stakeholders
on what it would take to
implement the Peak Service
plan. As the FRPRD intercity
rail requirements are identified,
the Common Set of Facts
will provide foundational
information that will inform
ongoing coordination between
RTD and FRPRD in a potential
joint operations scenario.

THE COMMON SET OF FACTS

The Common Set of Facts focuses on
five key components to implement the
Northwest Rail Peak Service plan:
1. BNSF Requirements
2. Operating Specifications
3. Infrastructure Requirements
4. Ridership
5. Capital and Operating Costs

1. BNSF Requirements

BNSF utilizes a standard set of agreements for
transit agencies to operate commuter rail on its
tracks. The four fundamental agreements are:

Access Easement
] RTD Acquisition of a long-term or permanent
real property interest for track access
] Provides dedicated passenger-only use of the
corridor during defined operating time blocks
] One-time RTD capital cost

Track Improvements
] Improvements required to meet commuter rail
travel time and speed specifications
] Freight sidings required by BNSF to allow RTD
dedicated use of the track during operating
time blocks (see example in Figure 4)
] Any additional work required to support the
track improvements (drainage, bridges, walls,
crossings, etc.)
] One-time RTD capital cost

Maintenance of Way
] Defines the allocation of the costs of routine
maintenance and asset refurbishment between
RTD and BNSF
] Recurring operating cost pro-rated between
RTD and BNSF

Dispatch and coordination
of train operations

2. Operating Specifications

BNSF completed train simulation modeling of the Peak Service operating concept and determined the
infrastructure improvements necessary to meet both RTD’s requirements and its own freight needs.
The route follows the BNSF Front Range Subdivision freight tracks and includes six new stations. The
route continues on the existing RTD B Line to serve four existing stations. RTD refined the operating
requirements in the following ways throughout the Study:
] Mid-day storage location requirement: RTD determined that a location near Westminster/72nd
Station was the preferred option for a mid-day storage location.
] Replacing existing peak period B Line trips: With the selection of Westminster/72nd mid-day
storage location, RTD determined that replacing existing B Line trips with Northwest Rail Peak
Service trains during the peak periods would minimize operating conflicts.
] Travel time specification: RTD sought to offer competitive travel time and determined that a
65-minute travel time between Longmont and DUS would be achievable. BNSF used this travel
time (+/- 2 minutes) as the design basis for track improvements.

Attachment: Final NWR-PSS Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Figure 4: Example of a freight siding

] Operational hand-offs: Since the Northwest Rail Peak Service will operate partly on BNSF track
and partly on RTD track, trains will require a transfer of dispatching and Positive Train Control (PTC)
at the BNSF and RTD track connection.

Fleet Characteristics
RTD will require five trainsets consisting of a locomotive, coach, and cab car to operate the service.
Three trains will run the service for the day, with one train reserved in case of breakdown and one train
undergoing periodic and required maintenance.
RTD evaluated different fleet options and determined that locomotive-hauled trains could operate on
both the RTD and BNSF tracks at high platform stations. The Project Team could not identify a Buy
America-compliant, high platform compatible, self-propelled train (e.g. diesel multiple unit, or DMU) in
current production for lease or purchase.
Locomotive-hauled passenger train configurations are readily available in the market, meet all of the
unique needs of the corridor, and are likely compatible with intercity rail service. For these reasons, this
fleet configuration formed the basis for the Study cost estimate.

3. Infrastructure Requirements

The Base Configuration includes the infrastructure requirements identified in Table 1. BNSF will be
responsible for all track-related work, communications and signaling, structures, and drainage. RTD will be
responsible for obtaining the fleet, building the rail maintenance and storage facilities and the remaining
off-track improvements, including stations and their associated amenities.

4. Ridership

DRCOG is in the process of updating the regional travel demand model from 2019 to incorporate
land use and travel behavior changes. The updated DRCOG model and transit-oriented development
planning by communities may further change the future ridership forecast for Northwest Rail.
Additionally, Colorado House Bill 24-1313 requires a minimum density near transit-oriented
communities intended to expand housing opportunity and transit ridership.

5. Capital and Operating Costs

The total estimated capital cost for the Peak Service Base Configuration is $650 million (in 2024
dollars). The cost for infrastructure improvements required to operate Peak Service in the Base
Configuration on the corridor are summarized in Figure 5.
Operating costs include train operations, vehicle maintenance, and cost reimbursed to BNSF for train
control, dispatch, and track maintenance. Total estimated operating and maintenance costs for Peak
Service is $12-16 million (in 2024 dollars) per year.
Both capital and operating costs in this report represent the current snapshot in time in 2024 dollars
and are based on RTD’s current understanding of the likely terms of its agreement with BNSF. Costs
for rail corridor improvements to support passenger rail service are based on 30% engineering plans
and cost estimates developed by BNSF. Cost estimates for the Access Easement with BNSF were
developed by the Project Team using experience with similar programs where BNSF is the host
railroad. Estimates for train control, dispatch, and track maintenance were developed using the FTA’s
National Transit Database (NTD).

Figure 5: Total Estimated Peak Service Costs

NORTHWEST RAIL PEAK SERVICE FEASIBILITY STUDY

Attachment: Final NWR-PSS Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Ridership forecasts were prepared for the year 2030 and found to be consistent with previous
forecasts. The 2030 forecast from DRCOG Regional Travel Demand Model (2019) is 1,100 boardings
per weekday with the total evenly divided between the morning and the afternoon peak periods. For
comparison, the Unfinished Corridors Report; RTD, June 2019, estimated 1,400 boardings per day
for 2040.

RTD developed a two-part strategy for
seeking input into the feasibility study.

Agency and Stakeholder
Engagement
RTD formed a Study Advisory Team (SAT) with
members of local agencies along the proposed
project corridor, as well as members from
regional transportation agencies and public
interest organizations. The SAT supported the
overall direction of the Study and gave RTD both
general and technical feedback. Several of the
SAT members were involved in earlier studies
of commuter rail in the corridor, giving them an
important historical perspective, background, and
understanding of the project.

Proposed station design concepts incorporate
improvements the cities have made to station area
roadways, corridor grade crossings, and active
transportation connections since the passage
of FasTracks. Figure 6 illustrates the various
engagement activities during the Study.

Public Engagement

Over the approximately two-year Peak Service Study,
there were two primary public engagement periods:
] Study Understanding (January and February
2023): Two in-person open house public
meetings and an online self-guided online
meeting.
] Confirmation of Base Configuration
(November and December 2023): Two inperson open house public meetings and an
online self-guided online meeting.

CDOT began planning for intercity rail under the federal process in early 2022 and expects to
complete its intercity rail plan at the end of 2024. The RTD and CDOT studies will provide the
requirements for each respective service and inform the next steps toward implementation of broader
passenger rail on the Northwest Corridor. CDOT’s study includes:
] An analysis of alternative routes, fleet
type, and service options

] Travel forecasts, rail operations planning,
and a financial plan

] Conceptual design to permit definition
of station areas, track improvements,
environmental screening and cost estimates

Front Range Passenger Rail has been approved for federal funding to support the CDOT study, which
is a required step toward being eligible for federal project funding.
The CDOT study identified the BNSF Front Range subdivision as the preferred route for service
between Denver and Fort Collins, creating a shared corridor with RTD between Denver and Longmont.
As soon as the preferred route was identified, FRPRD and RTD began cooperating to determine
how the two services could operate together. Figure 7 shows the potential for the overlay of the two
services with several shared stations.

While the purpose of the Study was to identify the facts associated with an RTD
peak service operation, the Project Team identified a potential opportunity for
RTD and FRPRD to coordinate efforts for a rail solution in the Northwest area.
Consistent with the FasTracks plan, RTD could deliver the peak service on its
own. RTD could continue to explore the emerging opportunity to deliver the
project in partnership with FRPRD.

RTD FasTracks
Implementation with
Commuter Rail Peak Service Only

RTD does not currently have sufficient funding to implement Peak
Service with an expected capital cost for the Peak Service plan of
$650 million. The findings of the Study reinforce the prior corridor
studies and the 2019 FasTracks Unfinished Corridors Report. RTD
has estimated a completion date for Northwest Rail between 2042
and 2048 based on its financial forecast. RTD should continue to
monitor federal grant programs for potential funding of the project
while continuing to work with BNSF to maintain the possibility to use
the corridor for passenger service. Demonstrating a strong, integrated
program with FRPRD and other local partners enhances the probability
of being awarded grant funding. RTD will collaborate with the statewide
effort to advance the statewide effort to advance passenger rail service
and coordinate the Peak Service Concept with that process.

and Intercity Passenger Rail

HOW WOULD RTD PROCEED WITH PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION?

Legislation passed in 2024 requires RTD and FRPRD to work together to determine how the two
programs could be delivered together. Completion of the RTD and CDOT studies would enable RTD
and FRPRD to develop a combined approach for improving infrastructure on the corridor and provide
service, either jointly or separately, while sharing the common infrastructure. Included in that effort
would be an allocation of costs and responsibilities. Opportunities to share economies of scale could
be realized between RTD and FRPRD that include joint operational efficiencies, shared fleet, and
shared improvement costs. It is reasonable to expect that cost sharing of common elements would
result in a lower cost for each agency.

Would Peak
Service be Eligible
for Federal Funding
Through Bipartisan
Infrastructure
Law (BIL)?

Commuter and intercity passenger rail
programs are eligible for federal grant
awards, but the application process would
require coordination with local partners,
including BNSF. Depending upon the
type of discretionary grant that would
be pursued, RTD may be competitive to
receive some federal funding.
Originally, the FasTracks Northwest Rail
project considered the possibility of
using federal funds from the FTA Capital
Investment Grant (CIG) program in addition
to RTD FasTracks funds. The discretionary
award of CIG funding requires the project
to be cost-effective compared to other
projects in the country; the key measure is
“total cost per new rider”. The calculations
for the Northwest Rail project showed
that the project would be far below the
threshold of consideration for CIG funding.
Recently, however, the current BIL program
began offering several funding programs
some of which the Northwest Rail Peak
Service would qualify. These programs
are project-specific as opposed to the CIG
program that covers the entire investment.
One approach would be using a more
targeted process focused on individual
elements that could be assembled. The
BIL is entering its fourth year of the fiveyear program where awarded funding
and balances are narrowing for remaining
available dollars. With development
of a funding and implementation plan,
a systematic approach could result in
the award of some grants for specific
improvements. Major funding for all or
most of the Peak Service Plan is not likely.
The BIL contains more funding for intercity
rail than commuter rail; a partnership with
FRPRD could leverage more federal funds
for both projects.

The Northwest Rail Peak Service Study defines the infrastructure required to
operate the Peak Service Concept – the Base Configuration – and allowed the
Project Team to develop a Common Set of Facts to inform future RTD Board
decisions about providing commuter rail between Longmont and Denver. The
Common Set of Facts addresses capital costs, operating and maintenance
costs, and ridership required to operate the Peak Service Concept, but any
decision on project feasibility rests with the RTD Board.

Since 2004 it has been RTD’s sole responsibility to plan,
finance, and deliver commuter rail between Longmont and
Denver. Early in the Study, the State of Colorado began
evaluating .intercity passenger rail between Fort Collins and
Pueblo that overlaps RTD’s planned Northwest Rail route
creating the possibility for a joint passenger service. RTD and
its partner agencies, FRPRD and CDOT, began evaluating
coordination opportunities while completing the separate
studies for commuter and intercity rail. The intercity rail study
for the Front Range corridor is currently in progress, but there
is an opportunity for coordinated rail service.
Before implementation of Northwest Rail Peak Service, RTD staff
will need to work with Northwest area stakeholders to identify:
] Final locations and design configurations for stations in
Louisville and Boulder
] Financial plan and strategy to implement the Peak Service
Concept by RTD alone or jointly with intercity rail
] Changes in BNSF operations that may reduce the feasibility of
passenger rail in the corridor
] Potential cost allocation between commuter rail and intercity
rail to leverage cost efficiencies for joint construction,
operations, fleet, and maintenance

Attachment: Final NWR-PSS Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

CONCLUSION

The Northwest Rail Peak Service Study and FRPRD’s intercity rail
plan will form the foundation for a potential joint path forward. The
intercity rail plan presents a new opportunity for RTD to work with
state and regional partners to deliver passenger rail service to the
Northwest area communities earlier than RTD could complete the
Northwest Rail Peak Service without partners.

Introduction
RTD is conducting the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (Study) for a 39-mile extension of the B Line
commuter rail service along the existing BNSF Railway tracks from the existing Westminster–72nd Station to
Boulder and Longmont. The extension would include six new stations with infrastructure to support the
commuter rail service: Downtown Westminster, Broomfield–116th, Flatiron, Downtown Louisville, Boulder
Junction at Depot Square, and Downtown Longmont (Figure 1). The Study will evaluate the requirements to
provide commuter rail passenger service during the peak periods consisting of three weekday morning trips
from Longmont to Denver and three weekday evening trips from Denver to Longmont.
The Peak Service Feasibility Study will be conducted in five stages, each with a major report:
•

Milestone 1: Confirm and refine the Peak Service Concept with stakeholders

•

Milestone 2: Identify local, state, federal, and BNSF requirements for the operation of service
(the “Base Configuration”)

•

Milestone 3: Conduct initial planning and develop preliminary engineering design and costs required to
build and operate the Base Configuration service

•

Milestone 4: Identify likely service expansion scenarios to avoid precluding expanded RTD or
FRPRD passenger service

•

Milestone 5: Identify potential project implementation concepts

This report contains the work completed to accomplish Milestone 1. This report is a compilation of the

Subject: Past Planning and Alternatives Methodology Memorandum
Page: 2

This memorandum provides background for the Study’s peak service rail concept and preferred design
option, including its service and operational characteristics. This memorandum details past planning
studies of the FasTracks Northwest Rail Corridor that have led to the need for the current Study.
Alignment

The Northwest Rail Corridor was originally studied in a US 36 Major Investment Study (MIS) (2001),
which recommended a set of multimodal transportation improvements along the US 36 Corridor,
including extension of lanes, implementation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service with on-line stations,
widened portions of US 36, a bikeway along US 36, upgrades to existing rail track, and construction of
a new rail track along railroad right of way to support commuter rail. Subsequent planning by RTD and
communities resulted in a recommendation to extend the commuter rail line to the City of Longmont
along BNSF right of way.
In November 2004, voters in the Denver area voted to approve RTD’s FasTracks Plan (2004) through
a sales tax increase. This initiative was proposed as a twelve-year comprehensive plan to construct
and operate new rail lines and improve elements of BRT, bus service, and Park-n-Rides, increasing
transportation options and connectivity throughout the rapidly growing Denver metro region. In
addition to these direct transportation and mobility improvements, the initiative pursued goals to
provide broad-reaching benefits to economic growth and environmental quality. As proposed in 2004,
FasTracks identified nine conceptual corridors including 119 miles of rail and 18 miles of BRT
construction. One such corridor was the US 36 Corridor, now known as the Northwest Rail Corridor.
The FasTracks initiative committed to fund the recommendations from the US 36 MIS, including
upgrades to existing tracks, construction of a new adjacent track for commuter rail to Boulder,
extension of the commuter rail line to Longmont in a single-track configuration, and the addition of
seven new rail stations.
The feasibility of extending the rail alignment beyond the Denver-Boulder US 36 Corridor was
evaluated in two studies, the Longmont Diagonal Rail Feasibility Study (2005), and the Longmont
Diagonal Rail Final Environmental Evaluation (2006), both of which found the proposed Longmont
extension from Boulder feasible and recommended locations for an intermediate station in Gunbarrel
and an end-of-line station in downtown Longmont. In 2006, RTD combined the commuter rail portions
of the US 36 Corridor and the Boulder-Longmont Corridor into one – Northwest Rail – to be studied
and implemented separately from the highway improvements planned for US 36.
RTD issued a Northwest Rail Corridor Final Environmental Evaluation (NWR EE) in 2010, which
evaluated eight alternatives for the commuter rail service, including single and double track options,
options within and outside of BNSF Railway right of way, and a no-action option. Extensive analysis,
including examination of capital costs, ridership, travel time, environmental impacts, and public and
agency support ultimately led the project team to a single preferred design option: A double-track rail
from Union Station in downtown Denver to downtown Longmont on existing BNSF Railway right of
way. This was found to be the most viable option for commuter rail in RTD’s northwest service area,
as other options had characteristics that failed to meet the project’s stated purpose and needs of

In 2016, RTD completed the construction of the first segment of the NWR line and the Westminster
Station at 71st Avenue as part of its FasTracks Eagle P3 Project. This 6.2-mile segment currently
operates as RTD’s B Line from Union Station to Westminster Station. RTD has since added two station
stops between Denver and Westminster, at Pecos Junction and 41st Avenue and Fox Street in Denver,
as part of RTD’s Gold Line service.
II.

Stations

Previous planning studies have considered a wide range of locations for stations to support the 41mile NWR line. RTD’s 2004 FasTracks Plan built off recommendations from the 2001 US 36 MIS to
propose seven total stations along the corridor, including Union Station. The US 36 EIS then used
modeling projections, community plans, discussions with local jurisdictions, public input, and
assessment of impacts to appropriately evaluate candidate station locations and develop conceptual
design plans. In the 2010 NWR EE, the preferred alternative included eleven stations between Denver
and Longmont, located at:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

South Westminster - 71st Avenue
Westminster - 88th Avenue
Walnut Creek
Broomfield - 116th Avenue
Flatiron
Downtown Louisville
East Boulder
Boulder Transit Village
Gunbarrel
Twin Peaks
Downtown Longmont

Four of the eleven stations (indicated in bold) were identified as candidate station locations during the
public and agency involvement component of the 2009 US 36 EIS prior to the decision to study BRT
and commuter rail separately. These stations were not included in the FasTracks funding
commitments but were included in the evaluation in case funding sources outside of FasTracks
became available.
2035 station boarding projections from the EE identified Westminster/71st Avenue, Westminster/88th
Avenue, Boulder Transit Village, and Downtown Longmont as the stations forecasted to generate the
highest average weekday ridership activity in the Corridor. When ridership from special events was
considered, the analysis suggested that the Broomfield - 116th Station had potential to generate
substantial special event ridership due to its proximity to the 1st Bank Events Center (the largest event
space in the Corridor). Conceptual site layouts for each of the stations carried forward were provided

providing consistent and reliable travel times or providing an affordable transit investment. Since the
release of the NWR EE in 2010, the proposed alignment of the NWR line has remained consistent and
supported by regional stakeholders.

B.1.c

In 2013, RTD conducted the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), a collaborative effort with the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG), northwest area cities and counties, and the public to develop a prioritized list of mobility
improvements for RTD’s NWR service area. The study evaluated transit options in the northwest area,
including the feasibility of extending RTD’s North Metro Rail Line to Longmont, adding new and
confirming existing plans for BRT lines, as well as service, operational, construction, and phasing
options for a full-service NWR with nine stations along the Corridor.
Recently, RTD has recommended six stations between Westminster and Downtown Longmont to
support its Peak Service Plan (2017). This brings the total proposed stations for the NWR Peak Service
Plan to ten stations: Four stations already in service at Union Station, 41st & Fox, Pecos Junction, and
Westminster; Downtown Westminster; Broomfield - 116th (partially constructed and in operation with
BRT); Flatiron (partially constructed and in operation with BRT and Park-n-Ride services); Downtown
Louisville; Boulder Junction at Depot Square (partially constructed and in service with local routes);
and Downtown Longmont. All stations would include bus drop-off lanes, multimodal connections, and
parking areas for Park-n-Rides that serve NWR, bus service, and BRT. In June 2021, RTD confirmed
these station locations with local jurisdictions.
III.

Operations

A conceptual operating plan for the NWR service was first established in the 2010 NWR EE, which
envisioned opening day service in 2015 with 30-minute peak-period service and 60-minute off-peak
period service between Denver and Longmont. By 2035, the service would run in 15-minute intervals
between Denver and Boulder and 30-minute intervals between Boulder and Longmont during peak
morning and evening commuting periods and 30-minute intervals at most other times. The peak
periods were identified as weekday mornings from 6:00 AM-9:30 AM and weekday evenings from 2:30
PM-7:00 PM.
The 2013 NAMS also assumed the rail would begin opening day service with both peak and off-peak
service plans. Operational assumptions from this study were 55 one-way trips during the week at the
same 30-minute peak period and 60-minute off-peak period intervals identified in the EE, and 36 oneway trips on the weekends, no more than hourly. As part of the NAMS process, BNSF provided cost
estimates for this service plan, as well as a less frequent operating service that would run nine oneway trips in both the morning and afternoon peaks. The NAMS report identified several issues with the
full-service operation plan, including BNSF cost estimates that were higher than anticipated by RTD,
insufficient FasTrack funds, low ridership projections, BNSF’s infrastructure conditions, and other
challenges within the Corridor. Given the difficulties and timing of implementing full-service
operations, the report recommended that RTD consider the completion of NWR as a long-term goal,
while emphasizing near-term improvements, such as bus and arterial BRT expansion, with mobility
benefits that would be seen sooner for northwest area stakeholders.
From 2013-2016, RTD considered options for feasibly advancing the project in the near-term by

implementing a partial level of NWR service. RTD’s Peak Service Plan, proposed in 2017, would
provide three one-way trips from Downtown Longmont to Union Station on weekday mornings, and
three one-way trips from Union Station to Downtown Longmont on weekday evenings. RTD
determined that it would be feasible to implement NWR Peak Service and allow for future full-service
build-out of NWR, while capitalizing on the potential to align RTD strategically with the agency’s stated
goals to partner with other entities such as the Front Range Passenger Rail District, Amtrak, and
CDOT.
Implementation/Phasing
Since the EE, RTD explored alternative implementation strategies to phase NWR implementation and
address funding constraints. The 2013 NAMS Report first considered phased implementation by
constructing the rail line and stations in five distinct segments. Phase 1, from Union Station to
Westminster Station, was completed in 2016 as the first section of RTD’s B Line during the Eagle P3
Project. The remaining four phases would include construction of rail segments between proposed
stations as well as the stations themselves.
While segmented implementation is not being considered for peak service, the peak period rail
concept would be developed to not preclude expanded service in the future as ridership and demand
warrant. If higher levels of service are proposed in the future, RTD will draw on examples of rail
services around the country that have shown success with phased build out approaches, such as
Sound Transit’s “Sounder” commuter rail between Tacoma and Seattle; the combined service of
Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner, the LAMTA Metrolink, and the SANDAG Coaster commuter rail in Southern
California; the regionwide Metra commuter rail system in Chicago; and Colorado’s own Winter Park
Express ski train. RTD also plans to monitor the progression of Colorado’s Front Range Passenger Rail
project, with goals to collaborate with the service as either part of base peak period or expanded
service.
Technology
The existing 6.2-mile Phase 1 segment of the NWR line is operated with electric multiple unit (EMU)
technology. While the NWR EE evaluated the feasibility of electrification for the remaining phases of
the NWR Line, it was found that there would be numerous issues with an extension of EMU
technology, including highly increased costs and longer construction times required for implementing
electric rail in BNSF’s right of way. In addition, because BNSF Railway operates double-stack and
possible triple-stack container trains on this line, overhead electrical lines are not permitted where the
tracks would be shared. Therefore, in 2010, RTD proposed that the remaining 35.3 miles of rail
operate using diesel multiple unit (DMU) technology. The potential partnership with Front Range
Passenger Rail likely reinforces that DMU technology is more feasible for the longer-distance routes,
especially shared freight corridor routes. While DMU remains the strong candidate, RTD will consider a
range of technologies, including hydrogen and battery electric.

The NWR service would require a new rail maintenance facility (RMF) for storage, service, and
maintenance of the new trainsets. RTD recently constructed the FasTracks Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility near the junction of I-70 and I-25, but this facility was designed to serve EMU
operating cars and would require expansion or modification to accommodate a DMU fleet. The current
site is also fully built out. While the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility could potentially provide
daytime storage or maintenance, the preferred design option from the 2017 Peak Service Plan would
ultimately require NWR trains to be stored overnight at a new DMU RMF, where they can be serviced
and stored between evening and morning peak periods. Prior to recent service refinements, the 2013
NAMS Report recommended an RMF to be located near the Broomfield - 116th Station between US 36
and BNSF tracks on a parcel of land which the City of Westminster offered to donate to RTD for this
purpose. RTD is now considering various RMF locations for maintenance and train storage in
Longmont.
Ridership and Service Options
The 2004 FasTracks Plan conducted ridership projections for the entire FasTracks system, including
Northwest Rail. The 2010 NWR EE subsequently conducted ridership projections based on operational
assumptions of 15-minute train intervals for the Denver to Boulder segment and 30-minute intervals
for the Boulder to Longmont segment in the morning and evening peak periods and 30-minute
intervals at most other times. Ridership projections under these operations estimated average
weekday rail ridership of 8,400 riders per day with the FasTracks-only stations and 12,100 with all
stations in the year 2035. Stakeholders requested a sensitivity analysis and revised distribution of
ridership projections during the 2013 NAMS. These projections forecast between 9,300 and 10,700
trips per day in 2035.
Both the 2010 EE and 2013 NAMS noted that operations would need to be optimized to minimize
operational costs and maximize ridership. Due to this goal, the studies suggested that reducing train
frequencies would be the most likely operational change to be considered as the project progressed.
Projections from both studies represent residents of the northwest area would utilize the NWR service,
but ridership levels may not justify the high cost of a full-service build out of NWR.
RTD’s most recent operations plan, the 2017 Peak Service Plan, considered several rail service options
that would operate only during morning and evening weekday peak periods when regional commuter
travel is highest. Options included one-way only trips and bi-directional trips in mornings and
evenings, as well as combined and separate operations options for the Boulder-Longmont segment of
the NWR Line. Option 1A, the preferred option from the plan, would provide three trips from
Downtown Longmont to Union Station on weekday mornings, and three trips from Union Station to
Downtown Longmont on weekday evenings. In comparison to other options considered in this
exercise, this service option would have the highest ridership, with a forecasted average of 4,100
riders per weekday in 2035. Travel forecasting and station boarding projections show that the majority
of commuters in the northwest area travel east into Denver in the mornings and back home to cities
such as Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, and Longmont in the evenings. As an initial

phase, this proposed service option has the greatest opportunity to replace trips that are frequently
traveled by single-occupancy vehicles, fulfilling Study goals to maximize ridership and improve mobility
through the corridor.
Additional Considerations and Next Steps

In June 2021, RTD confirmed the alignment and supplementary station locations of NWR with local
jurisdictions. However, development near the proposed station locations, including high-density
residential and commercial development, will require reconsideration of the original (2010) conceptual
design plans for the six stations that are not yet built. Previous conceptual designs for station
platforms, parking lots, bus lanes, and multimodal features at each of the stations will need to be reconfigured in most situations to accommodate this recent development.
Other items to consider moving forward will be decisions about potential locations for a RMF in
Longmont, which is necessary to serve the rail, as well as the feasibility of daytime train storage near
Union Station between the service’s operating hours.
In 2021, RTD signed a Memorandum of Understanding with CDOT to cooperate and coordinate on the
development of Colorado’s Front Range Passenger Rail Project. As that project continues to evolve,
RTD will need to coordinate with the Front Range Passenger Rail District, of which RTD is a non-voting
member, about cooperability between the two regional passenger rail services.
The Study will also inform the RTD Board of Directors considerations regarding the needs and roles of
the NWR service as part of its regional transit system. Stakeholder engagement and consensus
building are planned at each step of the Peak Service Study to ensure that RTD’s vision for overall
transit investment moves forward consistently with the desires and expectations of stakeholders and
residents in the northwest area.

Conclusions

Studies and decision-making regarding Northwest Rail over the past two decades have informed RTD
and led to the current Peak Service Study to add detail and assess updated operating plans,
preliminary design, capital and operating costs, impact analysis, ridership forecasts, and other factors
in the Study according to the service and operations of the Peak Service Plan Option 1A, as outlined
above. This memorandum, summarizing relevant Project history, provides background and context for
the peak service concept being carried forward in this Study, fulfilling Milestone 1 of RTD’s
Incremental Decision-Making Process.

Purpose of the Proposed Project and Project Goals

Introduction and Purpose
In November 2004, voters in the Denver Area RTD approved the FasTracks initiative through a sales
tax increase. The FasTracks Plan (RTD 2004) is a comprehensive program to construct and operate
new rail infrastructure and improve elements of bus rapid transit (BRT), bus service, and Park-nRides throughout the region. The NWR is a 41-mile segment of the FasTracks Plan. Six miles of NWR
are in operation as the B-line from Denver to Westminster and 35 miles have not been constructed
due to financial constraints.
RTD completed an Environmental Evaluation Study of NWR in 2010 and the Northwest Area Mobility
Study in 2014. Since then, conceptual details have changed. RTD developed an intermediate Peak
Service Concept for NWR in 2016 and in 2021 the RTD Board of Directors authorized funding to
conduct the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study. The PSS will analyze various factors such as
infrastructure improvements, train operations, and service options. Subsequently, socioeconomic,
physical, and environmental impacts associated with implementing the Peak Service Plan for NWR will
be completed following consultation with local communities and stakeholders. The PSS will determine
the Preferred Configuration for the Peak Service Plan, determine at a high-level what impacts could
occur during construction and operation, and also provide a cost estimate to the RTD Board. High
level environmental and planning assumptions will be used in the decision-making process. More
detailed environmental planning and permitting information will be included in any future National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) clearances, if the RTD Board decides to advance the Plan.
The RTD Board directed staff to conduct the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (NWR PSS) to
analyze various factors for implementing NWR. As summarized in Figure 1, planning studies for the
NWR Corridor have been conducted over the past two decades, and RTD has continued efforts to
enable NWR development.

This memorandum provides a summary of the previous Purpose and Need/Consensus Statements
and outlines the Purpose of the Proposed Project and Project Goals for the NWR PSS.
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) require every environmental impact statement (EIS) to “briefly specify the
underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives
including the proposed action” (40 CFR 1502.13). The Purpose and Need Statement is a critical first
step in a planning project, as it lays the foundation for what the study will do by providing the
rationale and justification for undertaking a major Federal action and forms the basis for the range of
alternatives to be studied in the environmental document. CEQ regulations require an Environmental
Assessment (EA) to include a brief discussion of the “need for the proposal” (40 CFR 1508.9) and
most EAs include language similar to a purpose and need statement and may be titled as such.
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) reference the CEQ
regulations and goes on to state, “Purpose and need development ordinarily starts early, such as
during transportation planning, and is refined during the environmental review process in response to
agency and public comments and incorporated into the EIS. A project’s purpose and need should
exhibit continuity from planning, through each project development phase, to project approval.”

Planning for the Northwest Rail (NWR) corridor began with the US 36 Major Investment Study (MIS)
in 2001. Planning continued with the 2004 RTD FasTracks Plan and the 2010 RTD Northwest Rail
Corridor Environmental Evaluation (NWR Corridor EE). In 2014 the RTD Northwest Area Mobility
Study (NAMS) was completed to develop a prioritized list of mobility improvements for the Northwest
area of the RTD service area. The subsections below summarize the Purpose and Need Statement
from the 2010 NWR Corridor EE and the Consensus Statement from the 2014 NAMS project. While
the Consensus Statement of the NAMS project would not constitute a Purpose and Need Statement,
they did help focus the outcome of the project, similar to why a Purpose and Need Statement is
developed.

2010 RTD Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation Purpose and Need

RTD initiated the NWR Corridor EE 1 to identify and evaluate impacts of implementing a fixedguideway, commuter rail transit service between Denver, Boulder, and Longmont. The United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was the lead federal agency for the project, rather than the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA), because the project anticipated potentially significant impacts to
wetlands and waters of the US under USACE Section 404 permitting jurisdiction, including an
alternatives analysis under Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act but did not seek federal
transportation funding. RTD developed the EE document following NEPA processes and procedures.
The following was taken directly from the NWR Corridor EE document.

P urpose of this P roject
The purpose of the NWR Corridor Project is to implement fixed guideway, commuter rail, mass transit
service between Denver, Boulder and Longmont.
Need for this P roject
Need 1: I m prove m obility – Mobility improvements are needed to provide alternatives to
congested single occupant vehicle (SOV) travel for project study area residents, employees, and
visitors. Per the 2035 Metro Vision Regional Transportation Plan (MVRTP) (Denver Regional Council of
Governments [DRCOG] 2007):
By 2035, population in the project study area is forecast to increase by 43 percent and
employment is forecast to increase by 58 percent.
• Programmed roadway improvements are not expected to keep pace with projected demand,
as: (1) regional personal trips will increase by 59 percent, (2) regional vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) will increase by 72 percent, (3) regional roadway lane miles with more than three hours
per day of severe congestion will increase by 203 percent, and (4) regional vehicles hours of
delay will increase by 353 percent.

Need 3: Enhance regional connectivity – The Denver metropolitan region currently has gaps in
multi-modal regional transit connectivity. FasTracks is primarily a plan to fill in major gaps with fixed
guideway transit (rail) and bus rapid transit. The NWR Corridor would link with seven other RTD rail
corridors at DUS (see Figure ES-2).
Need 4: P rovide an affordable transit investm ent – Any transit improvements must be
affordable within the FasTracks budget. In addition, the associated operating costs must be realistic
and reasonable for RTD to assume the service. In 2004, the FasTracks Plan allocated $565.1 million
(in year of expenditure dollars) for NWR Corridor capital costs out of the overall $4.7 billion systemwide budget. The 2009 RTD Annual Program forecasts the NWR Corridor Project capital costs at
$641.1 million (in 2008 dollars).
Need 5: R einforce local and regional transportation and land use plans – The NWR Corridor
is part of the 122-mile system of new rail transit facilities proposed within the regional FasTracks
Program. To assess potential local community acceptance of the NWR Corridor Project, regional and
local plans were reviewed. Local plans for communities along the proposed rail alignments were
found to be in support of commuter rail serving their jurisdiction.

2014 RTD Northwest Area Mobility Study Final Consensus Statement

The 2014 RTD Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) 2 project used a Final Consensus Statement to
guide the discussion about how to implement bus and rail service in the Northwest area of the RTD
service area. It began with an overarching theme, a discussion of how projects were prioritized, and
concluded with a discussion of each proposed transit investment. The rail elements are shown below.

An overarching theme serves as a basis from which consensus on the priorities is grounded:
•

The Northwest area remains committed to Northwest Rail as envisioned in FasTracks. Given
the projected timing of Northwest Rail’s implementation, Northwest stakeholders want to see
mobility benefits sooner.

Projects on the prioritized list should not be considered absolutely sequential:
Nothing should preclude the pursuit or acceleration of any of these priorities should viable
opportunities or partners become available.
• More than one priority can be pursued simultaneously.

Need 2: P rovide consistent and reliable transit travel tim es – Unreliable automobile travel
times are anticipated both from day to day and throughout the day (peak versus off-peak) in 2035.
Travelers will also experience unexpected delays due to accidents or inclement weather. An option
such as rail transit would provide more consistent, reliable, safe, and congestion-free travel on its
own dedicated and protected right-of-way (ROW).

•

RTD should be proactive, aggressive and creative in monitoring these projects for any
significant developments that help a project move forward (e.g. public or P3 funding
opportunities, BNSF plans).

North Metro Rail Extension (SH 7 to Longmont)
Estimated cost combined with projected low ridership yields an annual cost per boarding
almost six higher than Northwest Rail.
• It is recommended by the Study Team and accepted by the NAMS PAC not to proceed with
any action on this corridor at this time. The corridor should be re-evaluated in the future if
population densities or other conditions change.
Northwest Rail (FasTracks):
Given present funding challenges and accompanying near-term inability to secure a railroad
agreement, completion of Northwest Rail is a longer term goal.
• On an annual basis, RTD will explore and update Northwest Rail implementation strategies and
report to stakeholders and the public.
•

The outcome was that NWR would be a longer term priority and that construction would likely be
done in phases, with geographic extensions of a double tracked rail line, as proposed in the
FasTracks plan.

Northwest Rail Peak Service Study Purpose of the Proposed Project and Project
Goals

In recent years RTD has been coordinating with BNSF Railway (BNSF) to develop an operating plan
that could provide rail service to the NWR Corridor, while maintaining BNSF’s flexibility to continue to
operate freight service. By developing an operating plan that focuses on peak commuting times,
there may be opportunities to provide passenger rail service in the NWR Corridor that can be
implemented in the near-term and expanded over time as ridership grows and additional capital and
operating funds are secured. This phased implementation approach has been used successfully in
other major urban regions, particularly in the western US over the past 40 years.
Purpose of the Proposed Project
The purpose of the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (NWR PSS) is to identify the necessary
infrastructure requirements and operational considerations to allow peak period commuter rail service
between Denver, Boulder, and Longmont within the operating BNSF freight corridor. The peak period
service must be planned in such a way as to not preclude the full buildout of infrastructure that
would allow for all day commuter rail service as presented in the FasTracks Plan, and envisioned in
the EE and NAMS studies, or as a part of a Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR) service along the
Colorado Front Range between Fort Collins and Pueblo, including the Denver-Boulder-Longmont
areas.

Project Goals

•

Project Goal 1: Advance RTD’s commitment to complete the FasTracks Program. The
2004 voter approved FasTracks Plan included commuter rail in the NWR Corridor from Denver to
Boulder and Longmont. Subsequently, DRCOG, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO),
adopted the 2050 Metro Vision Regional Transportation Plan, which includes implementation of
the Peak Period Service Plan in the NWR Corridor from Westminster Station to downtown
Longmont, on April 21, 2021. Since station planning was initiated in earnest during the NWR
Corridor EE, the communities along the rail line have invested in infrastructure and advanced
planning to support the future rail line. Communities have implemented policies that support
transit and expected changes in commuting behaviors in the corridor, such as encouraging
compact, mixed-use development; updating comprehensive land use, and transportation plans
and policies; further refining station area plans; and investing capital funds around proposed
station sites throughout the corridor, in an attempt to change commuting behaviors by developing
housing project near transit investments. Many new Transit Oriented Developments (TODs) have
already been built around the proposed NWR stations. Other examples include that in October of
2021, Boulder City Council adopted new climate goals for the community to reduce emissions
70% by 2030 against a 2018 baseline; become a net-zero city by 2035; and become a carbonpositive city by 2040. In Boulder, transportation accounts for nearly one-third of all emissions.
Further, in 2019 the Colorado General Assembly passed a greenhouse gas reduction bill, HB191261, which set a goal to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions from all sources by 26% by
2025, 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050, compared to a 2005 baseline. Further, in 2021 SB21-260
was passed and signed into law, which among other things established three new state
enterprises focused on transportation electrification. At the state level, transportation accounts for
about one-quarter of all emissions. Further, communities along the rail line have also worked with
the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and BNSF to implement quiet zones (railroad crossings
that include physical infrastructure and warning systems, so train engineers are not required to
sound the train horn at the crossing). Quiet zones have already been implemented along the NWR
Corridor at the following locations:

Because this study is not being conducted as part of a NEPA process, a Purpose and Need statement
is not required at this time. However, in an effort to allow a potential project to move into NEPA,
Project Goals have been developed to guide this study. If a specific project moves into the NEPA
process, these Project Goals would be refined as part of an official Purpose and Need Statement. Five
Project Goals have been identified for the NWR PSS.

Quiet zones are also in the planning and/or design phase within the city limits of Longmont, a
portion of the alignment in Westminster, and in Boulder County. The communities along the NWR
Corridor have provided the densely developed housing and other uses around the station areas,
most of which are served by local bus routes. Connection to additional transit modes at these
stations is expected as part of the Peak Period Service plan.
•

Project Goal 2: Expand connectivity in the region short term and potentially beyond
the region long term. The Denver-Boulder travel market is served by the existing Flatiron Flyer
bus network, specifically for communities adjacent to the US 36 corridor (including Westminster,
Broomfield, southern Louisville, Superior and Boulder). However, the NWR Corridor serves
additional markets in the Denver-Boulder travel market including Louisville-Denver and LouisvilleBoulder, which are not as well served with transit. The Boulder-Longmont travel market is
currently served by hourly bus service being provided on the BOLT line. While transit service for
this segment is expected to be improved with the implementation of the SH 119 BRT Project, the
Longmont-Boulder-Denver travel market will continue to require a transfer in Boulder, making
transit less convenient for commuters. Therefore, the Longmont-Boulder-Denver travel market
would be better served with the addition of rail service along the NWR Corridor. In the longer
term, the NWR Corridor may become more financially feasible as one segment of the full FRPR
program, which is being planned to operate intercity passenger rail along the Colorado Front
Range between Fort Collins and Pueblo. The NWR Corridor could provide a route for both the
commuter rail service and the intercity service along the Front Range into and out of the highly
congested downtown Denver part of the region.

•

Project Goal 3: Provide a more affordable transit investment to serve communities in
the northwest region of the RTD District. To reflect the objectives of the FasTracks program,
the 2010 NWR Corridor Final EE presented capital and operating costs for an 11-station, 55-oneway trains per day service plan for the Northwest Rail line. These costs were $1.0 billion for
capital and $20.7 million annually for operations in 2008 dollars. The 2013 Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) re-evaluated projects in the Northwest area and updated costs for the
NWR plan in 2013 dollars of capital costs between $1.16 and $1.41 billion and $23.2 million
annual operations. Given present funding challenges and accompanying near-term inability to
secure a railroad agreement, completion of Northwest Rail is a longer term goal. Working with
BNSF and corridor stakeholders in recent years, RTD recognizes that there continues to be a
strong desire for passenger rail service such that a reduced service plan that can be implemented
in phases, focused initially on peak period, peak direction travel may now provide an opportunity

•

Project Goal 4: Provide consistent and reliable transit travel times. Even with
improvements to US 36 and the addition of managed lanes, auto travel times continue to be less
reliable in the US 36 corridor compared to those of transit service. RTD provides commuter transit
service in the Northwest portion of the region through its Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
program. According to RTD’s 2020 Quality of Life report 3, in 2019, the average automobile travel
time between the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride in Boulder to downtown Denver was 39 minutes with a
potential variability of 24 minutes (up to 63 minutes total). For Flatiron Flyer buses (FF2 express
service), the average travel time was 26 minutes with a potential variability of 8 minutes (up to 34
minutes total). By comparison, FF1 all stop service is scheduled for a 37 minute travel time. In the
US 36 Corridor, FF2 express service uses the managed lanes, which is largely responsible for the
limited variability that it experiences. However, the FF1 all stop service does not utilize the
managed lanes to the same extent, as these buses enter and exit the freeway at most of the
interchanges to serve stations along the corridor. In other corridors in the Denver region where
the transit service is light rail or commuter rail, the travel time variability is much less than in the
US 36 Corridor where the bus service is subject to roadway congestion, weather, or incidents.
Because rail transit operates in its own guideway, it is far less often affected by traffic congestion
or weather events that make roadway modes less predictable both now and in the future.

•

Goal 5: Investigate Partnerships for service growth in the future. There are several
options for who might operate passenger rail service in the NWR Corridor, including RTD, FRPR,
or BNSF. The Peak Service Study will allow for some of these discussions to be had, and in turn to
provide more clarity about necessary action to advance toward implementation. While RTD has
commuter rail operators, it may be advantageous to contract operations to BNSF Railway, as they
currently operate the freight service in the NWR Corridor. Nationwide, there are several examples
where the owner of the railroad operates freight trains as well as passenger trains on the same
line on behalf of the transit agency. Sound Transit (in Seattle) and Northstar Corridor
Development Authority (in Minnesota) both contract with BNSF to operate Sounder and Northstar
commuter rail service, respectively. Further, determining an operating arrangement also plays a
role for other operating agreements like the number of passenger trains that may operate on the
line and the continued provision of service if the line is ever sold by the railroad. These
arrangements could also clarify operating agreements for the broader FRPR service.

There has been significant progress with Quiet Zone implementation, but challenges and
expectations from BNSF have made it a difficult process. Quiet Zones are being implemented across the
corridor.
Stations are being placed in downtown areas or new “transit village” cores.
o There is significant private and public development in downtown cores and near station
locations. Some station locations may need reconsideration or further discussion from previous
plans because location options have seen the implementation of other types of development.
Technological decisions should enable the use of existing tracks and infrastructure.
Collaboration and engagement between municipalities is important (e.g. Westminster and Arvada,
Broomfield and Louisville, etc.).
There has been significant consideration of cross-modal connectivity: encouraging active
transportation for first and last mile connections, bike/ped infrastructure improvements around stations,
local bus network services, recognition of connections between existing Flatiron Flyer (and other existing
and planned BRT) service and future rail service.
Parking and Ridership:
o There are outstanding questions about parking: how to allocate parking capacity and how much
parking is necessary at each location. RTD’s typical approach is to estimate total parking for the
corridor and then work with jurisdictions to find sites to accommodate appropriate spaces.
o How will updated ridership numbers from forecasts impact parking requirements?
▪ The Peak Service Study will focus on the parking capacity needed for three trains per
day, but the study will have to consider the parking needs of other services (e.g. FRPR
and BRT lines).
▪ RTD will gather input on parking needs from each municipality.
▪ The travel model cannot be relied upon for station-specific parking predictions, so the
spots needed for corridor-wide projections will be divided among all stations.
▪ Longmont will likely have a large catchment area (and thus high demand) because it is at
the end of the line.
o Land acquisition and parking are being factored into RTD’s study costs.
o Phases of parking capacity build-out should be timed to match the development of rail service.
o Action: Patrick Stanley (RTD) to follow up with Phil Greenwald and Tony Chacon (Longmont)
regarding ridership projections by segment.

NEXT STEPS:
•

Technical Data Request: HDR will distribute a formal data request to SAT members via email. The
request outlines the plans, data, and studies needed by the study team.
o Action: SAT members to upload requested materials to https://bit.ly/NWR_PSS.

•

Technical Representatives Group: As the study advances, Steve Long (HDR) and the study team
will host an introductory kick-off call for all jurisdictions’ Technical Representatives in areas of drainage,
utilities, roadway and traffic engineering, transportation planning (including multimodal), and land
use/community development. The study team will then meet as needed on a one-on-one basis with
representatives from each jurisdiction to advance station design and integration with community
infrastructure.
o Action: SAT members to provide contact information for each jurisdiction’s Technical
Representatives to Chrissy Breit (HDR) at Chrissy.Breit@hdrinc.com by August 12.

Westminster advocated for it to be moved to downtown because of investment
in that area.
o Development at Walnut Creek (at US 36 & Church Ranch Station) could
inspire future rail station at Church Ranch, but this is outside the scope
of the Peak Service Study.
Multi-Modal Connectivity
• Hard to switch modes because US 36 & Sheridan Station (with Flatiron Flyer
BRT) is a quarter mile from proposed rail service
o Bike/Ped underpass beneath Sheridan Blvd currently under construction
(and would connect to US 36 Bikeway)

o Different assumptions around operators, markets, station locations
• FRPR must still study range of alternatives for alignment, route, and operating
service efore moving forward on engineering and planning
Federal Resources
• FRA’s Corridor Identification Development Program: provides FRA resources
and tools, and offers prioritization queue
• Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) can provide funding for each
step of development (including through CRISI)

SAT Questions:
• Federal funding opportunities
• Preferred alignment of FRPR: including ridership projections for each and
general timeline of decision-making

Corridor Conditions Report

Regional Transportation District (RTD) is conducting the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (Study) for a 35mile extension of the B Line commuter rail service from the existing Westminster – 72nd Station to Boulder
and Longmont. The extension would include six new stations with infrastructure to support the commuter rail
service: Downtown Westminster, Broomfield – 116th, Flatiron, Downtown Louisville, Boulder Junction at Depot
Square, and Downtown Longmont (Figure 1). The Study will evaluate how to best provide ‘rush-hour’ service
(Peak Service) on the existing BNSF Railway (BNSF) tracks: three weekday morning trips from Longmont to
Denver and three weekday evening trips from Denver to Longmont. The Study will update capital, operations,
and maintenance costs to implement the Peak Service on the Northwest Rail (NWR) Corridor in a manner to
not preclude a future buildout.
This Milestone 2 report summarizes the existing freight rail operations, infrastructure conditions, existing
conditions at the proposed station locations, and existing social, economic, physical, and natural environmental
resources within the NWR Corridor. The summary will guide the NWR development process to avoid and
minimize impacts, set the stage for discussions around potential mitigation requirements, and inform the
subsequent design and environmental phases. Information from this report will be summarized and referenced
in the subsequent Milestone documents and technical reports. Milestone 3 will document the planning process
and results defining the Base Configuration for Peak Service as requested by the RTD Board of Directors. The
Milestone 3 work will also include a description of potential impacts and environmental constraints, with
further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental and design project
development steps.

Previous Planning Context

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Planning studies within the NWR Corridor have been conducted over the past two decades, as summarized in
Figure 2. These planning efforts are detailed in the Past Planning and Alternatives Development Memorandum
in the Milestone 1 Technical Report. This chapter summarizes these past planning efforts and provides
background on the corridor and station locations assessed as part of this report.

Figure 2: Timeline of NWR Corridor Past Planning Studies

The NWR Corridor was originally studied in the US 36 Major Investment Study in 2001. In 2004, voters in the
Denver area voted to approve RTD’s FasTracks Plan through a sales tax increase, which included the
conceptual transit corridor now known as the NWR Corridor. Then the Longmont Diagonal Rail Feasibility
Study in 2005 and the Longmont Diagonal Rail Final Environmental Evaluation in 2006 both studied a proposed
extension to Longmont from Boulder. In 2006, RTD combined the commuter rail portions of the US 36 Corridor
and the Boulder-Longmont Corridor into one – NWR – to be studied and implemented separately from the
highway improvements planned for US 36.

RTD issued the Final Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation (NWR Corridor EE) in 2010, evaluating
eight commuter rail service alternatives, including single and double-track options within and outside BNSF’s
right of way and a no action option. Extensive analysis, including examination of capital costs, ridership, travel
time, environmental impacts, and public and agency support, ultimately led to a single preferred design
option: a double-track rail from Union Station in downtown Denver to Downtown Longmont on existing BNSF
right of way. It is the most viable option for commuter rail in RTD’s northwest region, as other options had
characteristics that failed to meet the Study’s stated purpose and need of providing consistent and reliable
travel times or an affordable transit investment. Since the release of the Final NWR Corridor EE in 2010, the
NWR Corridor planning activities have occurred within and along existing BNSF right of way and are supported
by regional stakeholders.
In 2013, RTD conducted the Northwest Area Mobility Study, a collaborative effort with the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG), northwest area
cities and counties, and the public to develop a prioritized list of mobility improvements for the NWR Corridor.
From 2013-2016, RTD considered options for feasibly advancing the NWR Corridor in the near term by
implementing a partial level of service. RTD’s Peak Service Plan, proposed in 2017, would provide three oneway trips from Longmont to Union Station on weekday mornings and three one-way trips from Union Station
to Longmont on weekday evenings. It could also capitalize on the potential to align RTD strategically with the
agency’s stated goals to partner with other entities, such as the Front Range Passenger Rail District, Amtrak,
and CDOT.
In 2016, RTD completed the construction of the first segment of the NWR Corridor as part of its FasTracks
Eagle P3 Project. This 6.2-mile segment operates as RTD’s B Line from Union Station to Westminster Station,
referred to as Westminster – 72nd Station in this Study to differentiate between multiple stations within
Westminster. RTD has since added two station stops between the Westminster Station and Union Station, at
Pecos Junction, and 41st & Fox in Denver as part of RTD’s G Line service. RTD’s existing B Line between Union
Station and Westminster – 72nd Station is excluded from this report's existing condition assessment.
RTD recommended six stations between Westminster and Downtown Longmont to support its Peak Service
Plan (City of Longmont, 2017). The additional stations bring the total for the NWR Peak Service Plan to 10.
Four stations are already in service: Union Station, 41st & Fox, Pecos Junction, and Westminster – 72nd. The
six new stations are Downtown Westminster, Broomfield – 116th, Flatiron, Downtown Louisville, Boulder
Junction at Depot Square, and Downtown Longmont. In June 2021, RTD confirmed these station locations
with local agencies. RTD’s Pecos Junction Station, 41st & Fox Station, and Union Station are excluded from this
report's existing conditions assessment.

Corridor Conditions Report

Freight Infrastructure and Operations
The NWR Corridor is planned primarily within the existing BNSF right of way and would utilize the BNSF freight
rail track. In recent years, RTD has coordinated with BNSF to develop an operating plan for passenger rail
service on the NWR Corridor while maintaining BNSF’s flexibility to continue to operate freight service.

Corridor Conditions Report
The Study Team obtained data on freight operations from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of
Safety Analysis, which shares data on crossing and inventory and data on safety, such as accident, inventory,
and highway-rail crossing data with the public. Railroad operations are proprietary data; however, the FRA
conducts a crossing inventory. This inventory includes information on the number of trains that crossed a
location during the day: 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and during the night: 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. The most recent inventory
was conducted in 2019, with three trains observed during the day and three trains observed during the night.
This inventory omits train speed or the number of locomotives or cars; however, the accident reports provide
the number of locomotives and cars. Based on the accident report data, the size of freight trains in the
corridor since 2010 ranged between 68 to 238 cars and two to eight locomotives, and travel speeds ranged
from 13 to 30 mph. RTD currently estimates that there are eight to 10 freight trains per day.

Existing Track Infrastructure
The Study Team identified existing track infrastructure using Google Satellite Imagery from October 2022 and
FRA Inventory Reports. There is one main track with three double-track sections or sidings in the NWR
Corridor. Double-track sections or sidings are identified at the following locations:
•

Lowell Boulevard to West 72nd Avenue: the siding is approximately 780 feet long

•

Nickel Street to Burns Junction: the siding is approximately 1.3 miles long; Burns Junction to approximately
Brainard Drive: the siding is approximately 2,800 feet long; these two sidings are continuous, and at Burns
Junction, there is another main track that separates to the north

•

Boulder Creek Overpass to North Boulder Farmers Ditch, just south of Pearl Parkway: the siding is
approximately 4,100 feet long

Roadway and Trail Crossing Infrastructure
The BNSF corridor includes 14 existing grade-separated roadway crossings and 36 existing at-grade roadway
crossings. Additionally, there are 11 formal trail crossings along the corridor, and a desktop review observed
12 informal or social trail crossings. Existing crossings of the BNSF corridor are discussed in more detail in the
Traffic, Circulation, and Parking Section and the Transit and Other Transportation Systems Section.

Quiet Zones
FRA guidelines require trains to sound locomotive horns before all at-grade rail crossings for 15 and 20
seconds. A local agency can apply for a quiet zone, which removes the requirement for conductors to sound
the horn at the crossing. Roadway improvements at crossings, such as quad gates, median extensions, and
additional signage, are required for the crossing to be eligible for a quiet zone. Municipalities along the NWR
Corridor have recently made improvements to crossings or planned projects for their at-grade crossings to
become quiet zones. The existing quiet zones by municipality as of October 2022 are listed below and shown
in Figure 3 (Boulder County, 2022; City of Boulder, 2022; City and County of Broomfield, 2022; City of
Lafayette, 2017; City of Louisville, 2022; FRA, 2022).

Corridor Conditions Report

RTD is planning six new stations between Westminster and Longmont to support its Peak Service Plan (City of
Longmont, 2017) as part of the Study. This section provides a high-level summary of the development
conditions near the stations. Figure 1 shows the locations of the stations.

Westminster – 72nd Station
The existing Westminster Station, referred to in this Study as Westminster – 72nd Station, is located west of
Federal Boulevard between the BNSF trackway and 71st Avenue. This station is the end-of-line for the B Line,
and new tracks would tie the existing RTD double-tracked electrified segment into the single-track BNSF
freight track. A pedestrian tunnel is provided under the rail tracks to the commuter rail platform. Parking, bus
loading and unloading, and passenger drop-off facilities are located north of the station platform between
Hooker Street and Irving Street.

Downtown Westminster Station
This station area is located in Westminster, north of the BNSF trackway, south of 88th Avenue, and Arvada to
the south. The station would connect to the new downtown Westminster development, where an increase in
residents and employees is expected as redevelopment of the site progresses. Much of the parking area in the
Final NWR Corridor EE is now developed or acts as an overnight hotel or short-term restaurant parking.
Currently, the concept is to utilize the one or two land parcels located south of 88th Avenue, where a
connection to the Discovery Trail south of the proposed station in Arvada’s Far Horizons neighborhood may be
made through a grade-separated crossing to eliminate the existing issue of pedestrians illegally crossing the
railroad tracks. The new station would serve the downtown Westminster area, which is expected to have over
two million square feet of office space; 750,000 square feet of retail, entertainment, and dining; 2,300
residential apartments, condominiums, and townhomes; and 300 hotel rooms. In the short term, buses could
stop along 88th Avenue, leaving more room for parking at a Park-n-Ride. In the long term, a bus turnaround
could be constructed on the west corner of the site.

Downtown Louisville Station
This station area is located in Louisville, on both sides of the BNSF trackway, between Parkview Street and
Griffin Street. Since the Final NWR Corridor EE, several developments have been completed surrounding the
Downtown Louisville Station area, including the first two phases of the Downtown East Louisville development.
Other developments are in the planning and design phases as well. Concept designs need to consider where
the platform will be located; some facilities may remain closer to SH 42 to the east and Main Street in
downtown Louisville to the west, and buses cannot serve Front Street due to narrow streets and on-street
parking. Shared parking is being considered on both sides of the BNSF trackway. Still, additional shared
parking opportunities may be warranted, which could serve commuters during weekdays and visitors in the
evenings and on weekends.

B.1.d

Corridor Conditions Report
This station area is located in Broomfield on both sides of the BNSF trackway, approximately 600 feet north
and south of 116th Avenue. The Broomfield – 116th Station is located approximately 0.25 miles east of the US
36 & Broomfield Station. The area has seen considerable development, with more forecasted in the coming
years. The area between US 36 and the BNSF track will likely see the most residential development as east of
the rail line comprises baseball fields and light industrial/warehousing. An important consideration is
connecting west to the existing US 36 & Flatiron Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) station and the adjacent
Arista/1STBANK Center development. An east-west connection under the railroad would also expand bicycle
and pedestrian opportunities. Some parking would likely be located on both sides of the rail line, with the
potential for a platted cul-de-sac adjacent to the new apartment complex west of the rail line, potentially
allowing for a bus turnaround.

Flatiron Station
This station area is located in the City and County of Broomfield, west of West Midway Boulevard,
approximately between W. Flatiron Crossing Drive and Via Varra. This station is partially constructed with the
US 36 & Flatiron Station and Park-n-Ride already serving Flatiron Flyer BRT routes. There is a great deal of
Boulder County open space north of US 36 in this area, with development potential within the limits of the City
and County of Broomfield. This station would likely require additional parking, as this station sees a great deal
of Route AB customers to Denver International Airport, as well as Flatiron Flyer commuters. RTD owns parcels
east and west of the existing Park-n-Ride on the north side of US 36. Buses currently only serve the south side
of the station, but FlexRide could potentially serve the rail station in the future.

Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station
This station area is located in Boulder, on the east side of the BNSF trackway, between Goose Creek Path and
Valmont Road. The area around the Boulder Junction at Depot Square site, west of the tracks, has been
redeveloped with a significant amount of new residential and office development since the Final NWR Corridor
EE. Boulder is expected to begin the second phase of its plan for this area, east of the tracks, likely in 2023
(Transit Village Area Plan, Phase 1 completed in 2007). The multi-level Boulder Junction at Depot Square has
six bus bays and structured parking at the southern edge of the development along Pearl Parkway, providing
75 parking spaces for transit use. A small parking and passenger drop-off area may be considered closer to
the rail platform for the area around Bluff Street, for accessible parking, as the existing parking is about a
quarter mile away from the rail platform. Further development would integrate the transition plaza to
accommodate bicycle and pedestrian connections and provide bike storage and ticket vending machines while
maintaining the viability of the existing multi-use path in this urban center.

Broomfield – 116th Station

Downtown Longmont Station
This station area is located in Longmont, south of First Street, between South Pratt Parkway and Coffman
Street. There has been some new development around this station site, including the northeast corner of the
US 287/Main Street and First Avenue intersection. Additionally, the area on the northwest quadrant is also
planned for redevelopment. This area would likely continue adding multi-family residential in the coming years.

Environmental Resources
This Corridor Conditions Report updates and builds upon an evaluation of environmental resources previously
documented in the Final NWR Corridor EE. The resources discussed are most often included in National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance and documentation, and this assessment provides a starting point
for that subsequent documentation effort. Each section discusses the existing conditions of the resource, the
agencies involved with its regulation, and the next steps should the Study continue to NEPA. The study area
used to establish the existing conditions for each environmental resource varies and is consistent with RTD’s
Environmental Policies and Procedures Manual Volume I (RTD, 2021). Methodologies used to establish the
existing conditions are documented in the Resource Evaluation Methodology Memorandum attached to the
Planning and Environmental Study Methodology Plan Memorandum (RTD, 2022).
Figure 4 shows the NWR Corridor in sections. These sections are approximately the same as those used in the
Final NWR Corridor EE in 2010 (NWR, 2010). Some of the descriptions of the existing corridor conditions for
resources use these geographic sections to facilitate the assessment, rather than the local agency boundaries.

transit customers would be located between the extended Coffman Street and US 287/Main Street. The station
is expected to become the transit hub in the downtown Longmont area where local bus routes, BRT,
commuter rail, and potentially Front Range Passenger Rail could connect one day. The remaining area is to be
redeveloped with multi-level, multi-family residential units, with the rail platform located on First Avenue,
which is planned for closure.

Corridor Conditions Report
Land Use and Zoning
Land use describes how land, across a general area or on one or more specific lots, is developed and used by
occupants. Zoning refers to the regulations that govern the characteristics of allowable development,
including the built form of the development and typically the allowable uses at the lot level. They represent the
activities allowed, practiced, and planned for in a given place: e.g., agricultural, residential, industrial, and
commercial. Land uses are designated by state, county, or local agencies through land use plans (General
Plans, Comprehensive Plans, Sub-Area Plans), zoning, and future development and growth areas.

Agencies Involved

RTD, working with BNSF, makes decisions about the transit infrastructure and services, while municipal
governments make land use and zoning decisions. RTD leads Transit Oriented Development (TOD) on land it
owns. However, the local agencies make decisions related to compatible land uses and connected, walkable
street networks to support transit stations.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Local agencies on the NWR Corridor have developed policies supporting transit services development. They
have concentrated developments near the new station areas to create high-density residential areas with
multimodal access to transit centers. Comprehensive, Sub-Area, and Transportation Plans reviewed for this
analysis are listed and summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.

Data Collection/Methodology

This land use analysis describes the existing and future land uses throughout the NWR Corridor. The study
area for this analysis includes a 1,000-foot buffer from the BNSF corridor centerline and a 0.5-mile buffer from
each new station platform so that it captures and characterizes land uses most influenced by the rail line.
Existing and future land uses within the study area are identified by reviewing Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) parcel, land use, and zoning data collected for each jurisdiction and information gathered from
local planners. Site visits and a review of corridor-specific, local, and regional planning documents were
conducted to confirm and update the findings presented in the Final NWR Corridor EE (NWR, 2010). The
compatibility of the NWR Corridor with existing and future land uses is assessed.

Findings/Results

The study area contains a variety of land uses, including residential, mixed-use developments, commercial,
agricultural, industrial, and parks and recreation. While jurisdictional detail varies, land use and zoning are
generalized in the text and figures to create consistent categories that allow for comparison and illustrate each
area's primary land use types. Figure 5 illustrates current land use within the study area, and Figure 6
illustrates the current zoning within the study area. In locations where existing land use data is unavailable,
zoning data is used – such as the city and county of Boulder and Louisville. The analysis that follows Figure 5
and Figure 6 is focused on station areas since these are the locations where new infrastructure is anticipated
and, as a result, has the most potential for change.

Corridor Conditions Report
The following text describes land use and zoning by the geographically defined study sections: Westminster,
Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, and Longmont.

The Downtown Westminster Station area is located in this section, between 88th Avenue to the north and the
BNSF track to the south. A cat adoption center and an appliance warehouse currently occupy the proposed
station area. Across the BNSF track, south of the station, is a medium-density suburban neighborhood of
single-family homes in Arvada's jurisdiction. Across 88th Avenue, to the north, is the former Westminster Mall
complex, now known as the downtown Westminster area. This area includes a variety of commercial
businesses, including retail stores, restaurants, hotels, and entertainment. The complex also includes some
high-density residential apartment buildings. The City’s Comprehensive Plan (City of Westminster, 2015)
identifies this area for urban renewal. It is zoned for planned development, including a high-intensity mixture
of commercial, office, civic, recreational, and residential uses as outlined in the Westminster Downtown
Specific Plan (City of Westminster, 2015). Outside the station area, land within this section primarily consists of
residential and commercial uses.

Broomfield Section

The NWR Corridor enters Broomfield at 112th Avenue near Main Street. In this section, the existing rail track
runs along the eastern side of US 36. This section contains two stations: Broomfield – 116th Station and
Flatiron Station. The Broomfield – 116th Station site is surrounded by discontinuous land use. Various land
uses are present near the station, including commercial, industrial, residential, agricultural, and vacant lots.
West of the existing tracks are storage lots, low-density residential areas, an apartment complex, several small
offices, US 36, and a goat farm. The area east of the tracks is predominantly large industrial facilities. Nearby
land uses include recreation associated with the Broomfield Industrial Park Sports Complex and a secondary
school.
The Flatiron Station is located on land currently owned and operated by RTD for BRT service. To serve the
NWR Corridor, a new station platform would be located within this area, directly adjacent to existing rail
tracks. Land use to the south of the station is commercial, associated with the Flatiron Marketplace shopping
mall. Some high-density residential apartment complexes and recreational park are also in the mall’s vicinity.
North of the station, agriculture and Broomfield Open Space are the primary land uses. The land between the
two stations and the remainder of the Broomfield Section contains a mixture of land use, with industrial,
commercial, and residential as the most prevalent.
Most of the land in the area is zoned by the city for mixed-use and industrial purposes. Two areas slated for

Westminster Section

Louisville Section

The corridor enters Louisville to the south at West Dillon Road. The track passes on the eastern edge of
historic downtown Louisville with a mix of retail, office, and residential uses. This area is defined as a
revitalization district in the City of Louisville Comprehensive Plan (City of Louisville, 2013). The existing rail is

elevated on a berm approximately 10 feet above the adjacent Front Street and provides a physical barrier
between western and eastern downtown land uses. East of the existing rail line to SH 42, industrial buildings,
newly constructed high-density residential apartment complexes, mixed-use commercial, and the historic
Miners and Little Italy neighborhoods are present. Directly across SH 42 is the expansive Louisville Sports
Complex recreational facility. Southeast of the station is the Colorado Technology Center, a 600-acre
industrial/office park adjacent to the rail corridor at 96th Street and Dillon Road, defined as a special district in
the City’s Comprehensive Plan. New suburban residential and commercial development occupies the land north
of the station, between South Boulder Road and Baseline Road.
The Louisville Section comprises a variety of zoning, including agricultural, open space, single and multi-family
residential, and industrial. Most zoning near the Downtown Louisville Station site is residential, commercial,
mixed-use, and agricultural.

Boulder Section

At Baseline Road, the corridor enters unincorporated Boulder County and runs for approximately two miles
between Baseline Road and Arapahoe Avenue. Uses in this area are widely scattered small residential
subdivisions, agricultural land, and open space.
The corridor crosses Arapahoe Avenue just west of North 75th Street and turns directly west toward Boulder.
The Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station is located near the southwest quadrant of Foothills Parkway and
Valmont Road. This area is predominantly surrounded by high-density mixed-use, residential, commercial, and
industrial land uses. To the west of the existing rail track is a recently constructed high-density residential and
commercial complex known as Boulder Transit Village, where the new station platform would be located. Large
offices for technology and software companies line this side of the rail tracks. The area to the east of the rail
tracks is occupied by industrial buildings which house electrical, technology, and appliance facilities. Northwest
of the station is a medium to high-density residential subdivision known as Glenwood Grove-North Iris. A
business park, industrial buildings, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are northwest of the
station. East of this industrial land is another medium to high-density residential subdivision.
Traveling northeast past the Foothills Parkway and Diagonal Highway/SH 119 interchange, the corridor enters
unincorporated Boulder County again and spans for approximately four miles along the eastern side of SH 119,
past the town of Gunbarrel until crossing SH 52, where the track enters the Longmont Section of the study
area. Land in this area is largely agricultural, vacant, open space, and low-density and rural residential.
Zoning in unincorporated Boulder County is mainly low-density residential, industrial, and agricultural. The land
is zoned for industrial and residential uses to the east and business, mixed-use, residential, and commercial to
the west. Near the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station, land use and development are regulated by the
Boulder Transit Village Area Plan (Boulder County, 2007).

Longmont Section

The corridor enters the Longmont Section at the crossing of SH 52. It passes through four miles of
unincorporated Boulder County and the town of Niwot until entering Longmont municipal limits near the
Diagonal Highway and South Fordham Street intersection. Land in this southern portion of the Longmont
Section is primarily agricultural and rural residential. The Downtown Longmont Station is located in the Central
19

Industrial neighborhood on First Avenue. The downtown Longmont area is located within the Southeast Urban
Renewal Area, as outlined in the Envision Longmont Multimodal & Comprehensive Plan (City of Longmont,
2016) and the Southeast Longmont Urban Renewal Plan (City of Longmont, 2006). As the corridor approaches
the Downtown Longmont Station, it passes through light industrial, manufacturing, and commercial land.
Industrial uses, including home supply warehouses, storage units, a used car dealer, a tire store, and several
mobile home lots currently occupy the station area. West of the station is Longmont’s utility plant. Across First
Avenue to the north is a parking lot associated with a cheese importer business and a public parking lot. East
of the station, across Main Street, there are newly constructed apartment buildings. Approximately 0.25 miles
north of the station area is historic downtown Longmont, which hosts a mixture of commercial and residential
land uses.
The Longmont Section's zoning is primarily for mixed-use, business/industrial, and public land use. Land
associated with the center of downtown Longmont is zoned for residential and mixed-use development north
of the station.

Next Steps

Although some undeveloped parcels remain along the corridor, many previously undeveloped parcels within
the study area were recently developed or are currently under construction; these are primarily high-density
residential, such as apartment complexes or high-density mixed-use. The amount and type of new
developments vary throughout the five described Sections, with most new development occurring near
proposed stations in Westminster, Louisville, and Boulder but less in Broomfield and Longmont. Local agencies
have been redesigning their conceptual station area plans to address these changed conditions. The Study
Team will continue coordinating with local agencies to ensure project planning is compatible with existing and
planned land use. The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential
impacts and environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent
environmental and design project development steps, as applicable.
During NEPA, the land use impact analysis will assess the degree of land use impacts based on the
compatibility of the NWR Corridor with current land use and zoning. The focus will be near station areas where
new infrastructure has the greatest potential to impact current land use and planned development. Additional
site visits will be conducted before the impacts assessment and final design to confirm existing conditions near
stations in a quickly developing corridor.

Economic Conditions
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Corridor Conditions Report

Economic conditions are the circumstances that facilitate commerce and economic activities, such as providing
income, employment, retail, and creating goods and services. Analyzing the economic conditions in the NWR
Corridor is important to understand how economic factors, such as business locations and operations, types of
commerce, jobs and housing, and income, occur under current conditions.

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 119

B.1.d

Corridor Conditions Report
Agencies Involved

Economic conditions are most closely regulated by local agencies that oversee land use and zoning, permit
access, and operations.

The local agencies on the NWR Corridor have policies that support the development of economic activities
within their communities. Comprehensive and Sub-Area Plans reviewed for this analysis are listed and
summarized in Table 1 in the Land Use and Zoning Section.

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area for this analysis includes a 1,000-foot buffer from the BNSF corridor right of way and a 0.5mile buffer from each new station platform. The methodologies associated with identifying the existing
conditions within the study area related to employment, income, and property along the NWR Corridor are
described below.

Employment

Employment data was collected using DRCOG’s traffic analysis zone data for 2020 and 2040 to show the
projected increases in each section of the NWR Corridor. The data were compiled for traffic analysis zones that
fall partially or completely within the study area.

Jobs and Housing

The jobs-to-housing balance is the relationship between the number of persons employed in an area versus
the potential housing opportunities in that area. In theory, a balanced community would have 1.0 to 1.5
employees for every housing unit. A ratio over this range indicates that more jobs than housing are available.
Conversely, a ratio below this range indicates more housing than available jobs. Factors such as major
employment centers, commercial/retail nodes, and housing density can significantly influence this balance.

Income

Median income was determined by using the American Community Study 2016-2020 table B19013 to
determine the median income for the geographies that intersect the study area. Median income was collected
for the overall municipalities and counties to encompass all passenger rail users.

Economic Clusters

Economic clusters were determined by using DRCOG employment concentration data. Any cluster labeled as
having a high concentration is considered an economic cluster for this report.

The majority of jobs in the study area are service-related positions. Service jobs include higher-wage
professional and business services, such as lawyers and accountants, and lower-wage jobs, such as clerical
and hotel workers.
Major employment centers in the study area are concentrated along US 36, Flatiron Crossing, and within the
Interlocken Business Park. The largest employers in the study area include Qwest (telecommunications), Wells
Fargo Bank, US Bank, Westminster Municipal Complex, Level 3 Communications (telecommunications), Oracle
(computer software), the University of Colorado, Ball Aerospace & Technology, Boulder Community Health, the
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Seagate Technology (computer disk drives), Amgen
(biopharmaceuticals), and Intrado (database and GIS mapping).

Job-to-Housing Balance

The study area has a 2.8 jobs-to-housing ratio, which indicates that overall, there are more jobs within the
NWR Corridor than housing options (Table 4). The highest job-to-housing ratios are found in Broomfield and
Boulder, the major employment centers within the study area. Boulder Section has a ratio of 6.4, and the
Broomfield Section has a ratio of 3.4, which includes the growing employment center in the Interlocken and
Flatiron Crossing area. Longmont also has a high job-to-housing ratio, which means more people are
commuting to the area for work. Table 4 details the study area’s jobs, housing units, and ratios.

Several economic clusters are located within the study area. RTD will continue coordination with the counties,
municipalities, businesses, and local agencies. The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level
description of potential impacts and environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to
proceed during subsequent environmental and design project development steps, as applicable. Further
recommendations from the Study would show the effectiveness of investment and land use changes within
and around the corridor.
Potential impacts on individual properties, businesses, and households will be identified during the planning
process, and mitigation will be developed. The planning process will also focus on the effectiveness of the
investment and recommendations for land use changes. Public and stakeholder outreach efforts will continue
through subsequent design and environmental processes to better understand the existing conditions and
potential impacts. Coordination will also ensure temporary access to businesses during construction and
develop traffic maintenance plans to maintain access and circulation needed to keep businesses running.

Social Impacts and Community Facilities
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Social resources and community facilities are the circumstances that facilitate social activities and provide
public services. Key elements include population, housing, community facilities (such as libraries, churches,
and schools), and key commercial areas.
This report has a separate section for environmental justice that preliminarily identifies the existing minority
and low-income communities based on readily available data.

Agencies Involved

Social resources are most closely regulated by local and state agencies that oversee land use and zoning,
construct and operate the transportation network, and provide public places and services. Cities, counties,
school districts, and private operators of community facilities are considered stakeholders.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Local agencies on the NWR Corridor have policies supporting the development of social characteristics and
community facilities. Comprehensive and Sub-Area Plans reviewed for this analysis are listed and summarized
in Table 1 in the Land Use and Zoning Section.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Next Steps

The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has developed the Community Impact Assessment: A Quick
Reference for Transportation (USDOT, 2018). Although not a regulation, it is a federal guideline when
assessing social and community impacts.

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area for this analysis includes a 1,000-foot buffer from the BNSF corridor right of way and a 0.5mile buffer from each new station platform. Population and housing characteristics that document past,
present, and future conditions and trends are described as part of this analysis. This includes past and future
25

Packet Pg. 124

B.1.d

Corridor Conditions Report
population counts, estimates, household size, and composition. The analysis establishes neighborhood
characteristics, population and households, and community facilities.

Findings/Results
Residential neighborhoods flank both sides of the NWR Corridor in the suburban and urban areas. The areas
with the most multi-family developments are in Westminster, with several apartment complexes within the
study area, and in Louisville, Boulder, and Longmont. Fewer neighborhoods are located along the rail line in
Broomfield and Boulder County between Boulder and Longmont because the existing rail line crosses through
undeveloped and industrial areas. The existing rail line was built before suburban development occurred in the
study area and can serve as a barrier between neighborhoods and developments. The rail line still has the
potential to divide communities with increased service.

Population and Housing

The NWR Corridor occupies the northern reaches of the DRCOG planning area, terminating immediately south
of the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization planning area. According to DRCOG estimates,
approximately 135,560 people lived in the study area in 2020. Based on future forecasts, population growth in
the study area is anticipated to be 16.1%, with an estimated 157,347 people living in the study area in 2040.
Households are anticipated to grow from 54,462 in 2020 to 69,310 in 2040, a 27% increase (DRCOG, 2022).

Next Steps

RTD will continue coordinating with the counties, businesses, and local agencies during NEPA. During the
subsequent design and environmental processes, impacts to individual properties, businesses, households, and
community facilities will need to be calculated, and mitigation developed for identified impacts. Public and
stakeholder outreach efforts will continue through subsequent design and environmental processes to better
understand the existing conditions and potential impacts. Coordination will also ensure temporary access to
social resources and community facilities during construction and the development of traffic maintenance plans
to maintain access and circulation.

Preliminary Environmental Justice Analysis
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Environmental justice analysis evaluates the impacts of programs, policies, and activities on low-income and
minority communities to achieve an equitable distribution of benefits and burdens. RTD would identify and
address disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on low-income and
minority communities. This environmental justice analysis is preliminary.
The purpose of the existing conditions analysis is to understand the demographic makeup of communities
within and surrounding the study area to establish a baseline for evaluating potential impacts and benefits to
disadvantaged communities. The analysis findings will guide the RTD engagement efforts, ensuring
environmental justice communities are invited and are provided ample opportunity to participate.

Agencies Involved

Environmental justice is a federal directive executed by agencies that carry out federal actions, such as the
USDOT. RTD is a recipient of federal funds and complies with environmental justice directives. Local agencies,
stakeholders, businesses, and residents provide information and input to the implementing agencies to inform
their environmental justice analysis through interagency coordination, stakeholder, and public outreach.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

This environmental justice analysis complies with Executive Order 12898 and DOT Order 5610.2 on
Environmental Justice, in addition to RTD’s Environmental Policies and Procedures Manual Volume I (RTD,
2021). The existing conditions demographic analysis is more comprehensive than the requirements for
environmental justice analysis, incorporating additional demographic characteristics and built environment
assessment. These demographic attributes are analyzed to identify the benefits and burdens of the Peak
Service to communities that may be historically disadvantaged or have a higher propensity to use transit.

Data Collection/Methodology

Demographic attributes were chosen for analysis to identify low-income and minority communities and
communities with a higher transit propensity than the general population. The definition of low-income and
minority communities, along with other community types discussed in this analysis, is provided in Table 8.
Additionally, aspects of the built environment were analyzed due to their ability to impact or benefit
environmental justice communities. The analysis incorporated the U.S. Census 2016-2020 American
Community Survey 5-Year Estimates is the most recent data. The level of geography selected for this Study is
block group level data; this is the smallest scale of demographic data available.

Study Areas

Multiple study areas were used to determine impacts and benefits. The study areas are defined as follows:
•

Identification of Impacts/Burdens: the impact study area is defined as 0.5 miles from the corridor
centerline, around the stations, and all candidate maintenance facility locations advancing in the Study.
Several demographic characteristics, described more fully in the next section, would be collected and
analyzed to help define the baseline social conditions in the Study.

•

Identification of Benefits: the benefits study area is defined as a three-mile radius around each station
location. This study area would be used to determine the communities that can easily access the station
(either by walking, biking, or driving) and can benefit from the rail investment.

These study areas are more comprehensive than those identified in RTD’s Environmental Policies and
Procedures Manual Volume I (RTD, 2021). At this level of analysis, the study area is typically wider than what
would be used in NEPA. The study area would ensure that the Study Team can identify pertinent information
that may arise later in the NEPA analysis.

14.3% for low-income communities. The thresholds were developed from the 2016-2020 American Community
Survey 5-Year Estimates.

RTD is partnering with community leaders and organizations to understand the community beyond what can
be learned from U.S. Census data. A survey and invitation for an interview were sent to community-based
organizations and community leaders. The survey asks questions to help understand environmental justice
communities and other disadvantaged communities within the study area. The data collected through the
interview and survey would inform community outreach for the Study and be documented in the final
environmental justice/equity report. Further data collection will be completed and documented later in the
Study.

Findings/Results
Low-Income Communities

According to the threshold used in the analysis, 139 of the 368 block groups in the study area are considered
low-income communities because they have larger percentages of households considered to be in poverty
(14.3% of households). Low-income communities in the study area are depicted in Figure 13.

Additionally, Table 9 summarizes locations in the study area preliminarily identified as having minority and

low-income communities and describes housing development in the area. It is important to note that in future
phases of project development, as more information becomes available, these data and locations of minority
and low-income communities may be updated.

Community
Adams County

Description
Between Federal and Sheridan boulevards and 66th to 84th avenues, many residents live below
150% of the federal poverty line and identify as Hispanic/Latino. The area includes mostly singlefamily homes and apartments.

Boulder

Due to the large student population, areas near campus report a higher percentage of low-income
residents. There are also several affordable housing complexes between BNSF and 28th Street,
including 30PRL Development, Hayden Place, Diagonal Court, and the Orchard Grove Mobile Home
Park.

Longmont

The St. Vrain Village is located near the corridor and Longmont Station Area at Prince Road and
Francis Street.

Louisville

The Parco Dello Zingaro Mobile Home Community is located off West South Boulder Road, a half
mile from the corridor.

Households Without Vehicle Access

Households without vehicle access are identified using American Community Survey 2016-2020 5-year
estimates. The study area’s households without vehicle access are 4.8% of the total households in the area.
The data indicates that of the 368 block groups in the study area, 119 have a higher percentage of households
without vehicle access than the rest. These 119 block groups are highlighted due to a high concentration of
households without vehicle access in the study area. Figure 15 depicts zero-vehicle households.

Community facilities data collected through a desktop review was overlayed with environmental justice data to
identify areas with a potentially high percentage of minority and low-income people using these resources. The
community facilities were evaluated within 1,000 feet of the proposed alignment, compared to a half mile for
the environmental justice analysis. Based on the available community facilities data, 50 out of 80 are within
block groups that meet the minority or low-income population thresholds. This indicates that many community
resources are located in environmental justice communities. The main types of community resources within
these areas are schools, places of worship, government offices, colleges, and libraries. The clusters are located
in the economic clusters listed in the previous section. The community resources located in environmental

Corridor Conditions Report
Multimodal access to stations would enable all communities, especially environmental justice communities, to
maximize the benefit of a station in their community. Multimodal access means that the stations have safe and
convenient connections for individuals who walk, bike, take transit, or use other multimodal options to access
stations. The multimodal connections are critical for households with zero or fewer vehicles than adults who
drive. Furthermore, young people, people with disabilities, seniors, and other individuals benefit when transit is
accessible.
The study area around the stations currently has varying levels of multimodal access. Public transportation is
already in place for stations serving the Flatiron Flyer or other RTD services. Other stations are in industrial
areas and have not yet incorporated bike, pedestrian, and transit networks with multimodal design and
infrastructure. Certain station areas plan to include multimodal access with a robust sidewalk and bike lane
network.
To address the opportunities to improve multimodal access to stations, the Study Team documented existing
conditions and met with the municipalities to discuss improved connections. The municipalities are committed
to improving safety and multimodal connections, and many with plans to do so. RTD is also evaluating
opportunities to reroute buses and reconsider service levels so that RTD’s bus network can better serve the
stations to accommodate Peak Service.

Next Steps

The identified minority and low-income communities and other communities with a higher transit propensity
than the general population provide a reference to guide the refinement of a project description and inform
the environmental justice analysis during project development. The Planning and Environmental Study will
include a high-level description of potential impacts and environmental constraints, with further
recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental and design project development steps,
as applicable.
During NEPA, the USDOT will formally determine if a project has disproportionately high and adverse human
health and environmental effects on low-income and minority communities. Prior to NEPA, during this Study,
the RTD Transit Equity Office will provide the updated thresholds developed from the 2016-2020 American
Community Survey 5-Year Estimates before the end of the Study, and the Study Team will update the analysis
with the new thresholds. To refine the demographic and built environment analysis, the Study Team will
incorporate the new RTD thresholds into the analysis of minority and low-income communities. In addition,
any environmental justice communities or disadvantaged communities identified through the community-based
organization and community leader survey will be documented.

Corridor Conditions Report
The RTD Transit Police Division operates a security model dedicated to providing a safe and secure transit
system for its customers, employees, and the community. At the time of this report, the division comprises the
chief of police, one deputy chief, one administrative lieutenant, four sergeants, and a team of transit police
officers. The division is supported by two 911 dispatch centers operating 24/7, a video investigation unit, and
more than 600 contracted police and uniformed security officers. The transit police jurisdiction encompasses
nearly 2,400 square miles, operating in eight counties and 40 cities across the Denver Metropolitan Area (RTD,
2022).
For new rail projects, RTD convenes a Fire and Life Safety Committee comprised of local law enforcement and
emergency services representatives. This committee assists with developing an emergency plan for the study
area and coordinates responses to various emergencies. RTD also has design guidelines for station areas to
reduce crime at stations and parking facilities.
In addition to the RTD Transit Policy Division, local agencies have police departments, fire departments, and
emergency response units within the study area.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

RTD prioritizes the safety and security of its customers and implements a system-wide safety plan. The
system-wide safety plan encompasses topics related to RTD’s operations, customers, motorists, cyclists, and
pedestrians. For the safety, convenience, and comfort of everyone, RTD established a Code of Conduct that
addresses certain conduct prohibited on all RTD vehicles, facilities, and property (RTD, 2020).
RTD’s Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria (RTD, 2016a) and Bus Infrastructure Standard
Drawings (RTD, 2016b) include strategies for implementing bus user safety and crime protection measures.
These strategies minimize potential threats, including visibility, lighting, and eliminating structural hiding places
through design. In addition, RTD follows applicable Federal Transit Administration (FTA) safety and security
measures and guidelines during the design, construction, and operation of transit service facilities. RTD- and
FTA-funded projects follow a comprehensive Safety and Security Certification process to minimize the potential
for harm to the public. Local agency law enforcement is also consulted on ways to minimize threats to the
public.
RTD launched the Partners in Safety program in 2010, which is a collaborative effort between RTD employees,
customers, and the public to create awareness of safety issues and take action to promote a safer
environment around buses, trains, tracks, and crossings. In addition, RTD developed the Transit Watch app
that is downloadable by phone and accessible to customers to report any safety and security concerns to RTD
transit police.

Reported event types for light rail vehicles for 2016 and 2017 are presented in Table 12. According to the Rail

Safety Data Report (USDOT FTA, 2021), rail-grade crossing collisions are the most common event type on

transit vehicles, with 786 incidents reported in 2016 and 761,507 incidents reported in 2017. Rail-grade
crossing collisions are a collision between a rail transit train and any other object or person at a grade crossing
or street intersection. Homicide/assault is an attack against a person on transit agency property, whether
deadly or not. Table 12 describes the security event types recorded by the USDOT.

Boulder and Broomfield Counties are the only counties where wildfire risks were identified within the NWR
Corridor. Approximately 15.5 miles of the NWR Corridor in Boulder County are located in low to moderate
areas of risk for wildfires (Colorado State Forest Service, 2022). Approximately one-mile NWR Corridor in
Broomfield County is located in low to moderate areas of risk for wildfires (Colorado State Forest Service,
2022). The City of Boulder and Boulder County provide Community Wildfire Protection Plans that establish how
to prepare for wildfires and recover from a burning event (Boulder County, 2011 and City of Boulder, 2007).
Table 13 establishes fire services in each county that provide emergency support throughout the NWR
Corridor.
The Colorado State Patrol provides emergency response services and traffic enforcement throughout the NWR
Corridor. However, their duties, responsibilities, and responses do not extend to municipalities. The Boulder
County Sheriff’s Office handles emergency dispatch services for Boulder County and the towns of Lyons and
Superior. The Boulder Police Department handles emergency dispatch service for Boulder, and the Louisville
Police Department and Fire Protection District handles dispatch for Louisville. Adams and Jefferson Counties
also provide emergency response services and traffic enforcement.
Emergency service providers rely on major transportation networks to respond to incidents within the study
area. The NWR Corridor contains several existing at-grade crossings that emergency responders must
navigate. At-grade crossings are described in the Traffic, Circulation, and Parking Section.

Next Steps

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable.
During NEPA and subsequent design processes, utilize RTD’s Fire and Life Safety Committee and Bus
Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria (RTD, 2016a) and Bus Infrastructure Standard Drawings (RTD,
2016b). RTD will work with law enforcement, fire, and emergency service providers to provide facilities that
best meet the needs of RTD and local communities. Identify emergency routes that may be temporarily closed
during construction or permanently rerouted, and work with communities and local law enforcement to
develop mitigation measures to ensure emergency response times are maintained.

Traffic, Circulation, and Parking
Brief Description of Resource Studied

This section summarizes the roadway network, including existing congestion levels and roadway volumes,
future roadway projects, and parking facilities. Traffic conditions focus on locations where the BNSF rail line
crosses the roadway network, at railway crossings along the NWR Corridor, and in the areas surrounding the
six stations. The information provided in this section has been summarized from the Traffic Corridor Context
Report (Appendix A). This section focuses only on the roadway network; however, the subsequent Transit,
Bicycle, and Pedestrian Systems section focus on those modes of transportation.

Agencies Involved

Information for this section was obtained from RTD, CDOT, DRCOG, US 36 Commuting Solutions,
Westminster, Jefferson County, the City and County of Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, Boulder County, and
Longmont.

Previous studies used in this analysis include the 2010 NWR Corridor EE, the 2014 Northwest Area Mobility
Study, the Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP) (RTD, 2022), and other local transportation
planning documents.

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area for the analysis is a 0.5-mile buffer around the existing BNSF corridor, which includes six
stations, 14 existing grade-separated crossings, 36 existing at-grade crossings, and four new sidings. For
purposes of this report, Peak Service weekday morning trips are assumed to operate three times during the
morning peak period: departing Longmont between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and three times in the afternoon
departing Union Station between 4:15 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. Data for the existing traffic conditions were derived
from online sources, including Google Maps, Google Earth, and Replica HQ. Google Earth satellite imagery was
used to identify at-grade crossings, with the crossing locations mapped using the most current NWR Corridor.
Google Street View images were reviewed at the at-grade crossing locations to assess the number of lanes,
crossing control arms, pedestrian crossing conditions, and lighting at the crossing. Next, the roadway
classification at the crossing was noted. Traffic volume estimates at the crossings come from Replica HQ, a big
data software that provides regional volume data similar to a travel demand model. Replica HQ simulates the
movements and trips of a ‘synthetic population’ and uses this data to predict traffic volumes over the region’s
roadway network. This Study used data from Replica HQ’s fall 2019 Thursday model run, which was chosen to
represent typical weekday traffic. The volumes were used to give an approximate estimate of expected traffic
on railway crossings. DRCOG data were also used to develop existing roadway volumes.
Google Earth was used to identify the nearest signalized and unsignalized intersections from the at-grade
crossing in both directions. Locations, where the tracks cross close to a signalized intersection, have the
greatest potential to cause wider traffic disruptions to the surrounding network. Adjacent cross streets also
have the potential to be affected by backups caused by rail crossing activity. This work lays the foundation for
a future traffic impact analysis, where these potential impacts will be studied in more detail.

Existing Roadway Network

The existing roadway network in the NWR Corridor consists of freeways (I-25, US 36, and Northwest
Parkway), United States Highways (US 287), State Highways (SH 128, SH 42, SH 7, SH 52, and SH 119), and
a variety of arterial, collector, and local streets. The network’s backbone is the US 36 corridor between Denver
and Boulder and the SH 119 corridor between Boulder and Longmont. US 36 connects with I-25 and I-270 to
bring commuters into downtown Denver and other destinations.

Corridor Conditions Report
Existing Congestion

Google Maps uses a color scheme to indicate levels of traffic congestion: green represents little traffic
congestion, orange represents mild traffic congestion, red represents heavy traffic congestion, and dark red
represents extremely heavy traffic congestion. On the day of data collection, typical traffic conditions at all atgrade crossings fell under either green or orange conditions, suggesting little to mild traffic congestion exists
currently on the typical weekday.
Traffic conditions at the nearest cross streets to the at-grade crossings are observed using Google Maps traffic
data. Congestion at an intersection near an at-grade crossing has the potential to be indirectly worsened by
traffic conditions at the at-grade crossing and may contribute to the need for further study. The conditions at
the nearest intersections to the crossings are included in the generalized congestion levels listed for each
crossing.
Business activity can be potentially affected by traffic impacts at the crossings, and business activity can also
contribute to the congestion at the crossings. Satellite imagery and Google Street views of areas surrounding
the at-grade crossings are used to rate the level of business activity surrounding the crossings. Each crossing
was subjectively assigned a Commerce Index rating based on observed land use, ranging from 1 to 5. A rating
of 1 signifies a crossing in a low-density, rural setting with no surrounding business activity; a rating of 3
signifies a low-to-medium density of businesses served by low-volume driveways and parking lots; and a
rating of 5 signifies a dense, urban business landscape. The ratings are meant only to indicate where further
investigation may be necessary due to existing commerce and the potential for impacts and inform a future
traffic operations analysis.
Table 14 lists the observed Google Maps traffic congestion levels at the at-grade crossings and the Commerce
Index ratings.

Traffic impacts at the at-grade crossings could be reduced with the regularity of the passenger train schedule
because freight trains are not forecasted to operate when passenger trains are running during Peak Service
times. Existing traffic congestion levels for the areas near at-grade crossings are approximated using Google
Maps’ typical traffic data for a Thursday when the train is projected to pass. A field visit has not verified these
congestion levels.

At-Grade Rail Crossings

Railway crossings are categorized by at-grade crossings and grade-separated crossings. At-grade crossings
have the potential to impact traffic along the NWR Corridor. Gate closure times at the at-grade crossings
impact traffic flow and congestion levels. Currently, gate closures occur when the BNSF freight trains pass.
Current gate closure times for the freight trains are uncertain because the BNSF schedule is not readily
available or routinely predictable. Three-car passenger trains’ estimated gate closure time is approximately 30
to 60 seconds. Future traffic operations analysis could compare existing gate closure times and projected gate
closure times during Peak Service periods.
Basic information was collected for each at-grade crossing. The existing conditions at each at-grade crossing
are shown in Table 18.

Cross Streets and Signalized Intersections Near At-Grade Crossings

Turning movements on streets that cross the roads impacted by at-grade crossings can potentially be
disrupted by the queue of vehicles backed up by the at-grade crossing. Existing conditions for these cross
streets near the at-grade crossings are identified because these streets have the highest potential for
disruption due to the traffic caused by the at-grade crossing. Two sets of data are listed: the nearest cross
streets of any kind in both directions from the crossing and the two nearest signalized intersections in both
directions. The control type and the classification of the nearest cross street are also listed. Types of control
include signalized intersections, one-way stop control (OWSC), two-way stop control (TWSC), all-way stop
control (AWSC), and yield signs. This data is summarized in Table 19 and Table 20

67

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Gate closure times at the at-grade crossings impact traffic flow and congestion levels. Gate closure times for
freight trains are substantially longer than the 30-60 second times projected for the three-car passenger trains
because the trains are significantly longer than passenger trains and often travel at slower speeds. RTD
estimates that there are between eight to 10 freight trains per day, and some of these trains may operate
during peak times, including the Peak Service timeframes.

Corridor Conditions Report
Parking

•

Downtown Westminster Station: Westminster has actively worked to redevelop the former
Westminster Mall into its new downtown Westminster development. Many of the streets would provide onstreet parking. The City is working with RTD to provide parking spaces for transit users at the Downtown
Westminster Station. The rail station would be approximately one-half mile west of the existing US 36 &
Sheridan Station, providing over 1,300 parking spaces for transit users.

•

Broomfield – 116th Station: West of the rail line along Wadsworth Boulevard, many new multi-family
residential developments have already been constructed or are in the planning phase. The area comprises
light industrial/warehouse land uses east of the rail line. The City and County of Broomfield are working
with RTD to provide potential parking spaces for transit users on both sides of the corridor.

•

Flatiron Station: The Flatiron Station currently serves the Flatiron Flyer and AB Routes at the US 36 &
Flatiron bus station. The lot on the north side of US 36 has 264 parking spaces and is well utilized, mostly
by employees and travelers to Denver International Airport using Route AB. RTD owns additional land at
this station that may be required for parking lot expansion to accommodate rail customers at this station.

•

Downtown Louisville Station: Louisville added several new visitor parking areas on both sides of the
rail line in recent years. However, these spaces are often heavily utilized on weekends and weekday
evenings. There may be a need, and some opportunities, to utilize some shared parking spaces that may
be used for transit users on weekdays and visitors on weekends. Still, additional parking would be
considered at this station location.

•

Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station: Boulder has nearly completely redeveloped the area west
of the rail line, now called Boulder Junction at Depot Square. The City worked with RTD to build an
underground bus facility with six bus bays and parking. There are 75 parking spaces dedicated to transit
patrons in this facility. A small amount of accessible parking may be needed closer to the rail platform,
located approximately one-quarter mile north of the existing bus/parking facility at this station site.

•

Downtown Longmont Station: Longmont worked with RTD to develop plans for a bus station and
parking structure for transit customers between the extended Coffman Street and US 287/Main Street with
101 parking spaces. This would be located close to the rail platform and is expected to become the transit
hub in downtown Longmont.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Parking is an important component of the transportation network, as commuters who use transit need a place
to park their vehicle in most suburban environments. Existing residential and commercial development
generally has adequate parking for residents, employees, or customers throughout the corridor. As growth
continues, new developments would be anticipated to add adequate parking to accommodate demand. The
following provides more detail about the station areas regarding existing public and transit parking.

Next Steps

Based on a review of the data collected, most of the at-grade crossings have existing conditions that do not
cause concern about traffic impacts due to the operation of Peak Service. A field visit to the at-grade crossings
with higher congestion levels is advised and could be conducted as part of the future traffic operations
analysis.
73

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 172

B.1.d

Corridor Conditions Report
Each of the six new stations is expected to generate new roadway trips to and from the station. Exact trip
generation numbers will be refined further in the traffic operations analysis conducted in the next project
development phase as the project description is defined. Each station access driveway will be studied more
deeply, along with nearby intersections based on congestion and expected trips.

The Study Team may order counts for future traffic operations analysis if there are still significant data gaps.
The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable. During NEPA, additional analysis will occur based on an
increased level of detail and any new data that may be available. Traffic mitigation measures at stations would
be considered near stations, as warranted.

Transit, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Systems
Brief Description of Resource Studied

With the implementation of the Peak Service, it is reasonable to expect increased transit ridership in RTD’s
northwest service area (northwest area). In a region experiencing rapid and significant population and
economic growth, the worsening effects of climate change, along with federal and local agency policy
decisions that are driving programs to seek environmentally conscious decisions, the promotion of transit will
continue to be an increasing priority.
Even with increased traffic congestion and worsening environmental conditions, travel demands are not
decreasing. RTD’s Quality of Life State of the System (RTD, 2020) report states that in 2018, 21% of lane
miles on major roadways in the Denver Metropolitan Area (1,489 miles) were congested for three or more
hours on an average weekday. A typical vehicle spent 16% of its travel time in delayed conditions; in 2019,
there were over 77 million vehicle hours of delay. Transit investments such as the NWR Corridor provide
options for travelers and reduce trips along the roadway system.
This section outlines the past, current, and future conditions of transit service, the bicycle and pedestrian
networks surrounding the six new NWR stations, and how current and future transit conditions would interact
with the NWR Peak Service. The information provided in this section has been summarized from the Transit
Corridor Context Report (Appendix B).

Agencies Involved

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

To advance analysis in the next phase, existing turning movement counts and other data will be requested
from municipalities.

RTD is the primary regional transit provider within the NWR Corridor; however, local agencies within the NWR
Corridor also provide some public transit services to residents. Local agencies also implement and maintain
bicycle and pedestrian networks within the NWR Corridor.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Previous studies used in this analysis include the Final NWR Corridor EE, the 2014 Northwest Area Mobility
Study, the Reimagine RTD SOP (RTD, 2022), and other local transportation planning documents. Relevant
regulations include 1994 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended FHWA Order 6640.23A on

Corridor Conditions Report

First- and last-mile connections provide important links to transit. Personal and shared E-bikes and e-scooters
have helped fill some first-mile/last-mile gaps. These conveyances (particularly personal) are expected to
expand in the service area and the metropolitan Denver area. In addition, many communities along the NWR
Corridor have FlexRide, a curb-to-curb service operated by RTD where residents can reserve a ride and be
picked up at any location within the service area.

Figure 21). The areas along the NWR Corridor have experienced significant growth in the last decade, which is
predicted to continue. The area also sees high levels of people commuting by car as people drive to work and
home along US 36 and I-25, contributing to undesirable traffic congestion in peak commuting times. Transit is
in demand with increased population and travel demand in the region.

Corridor Conditions Report

The following sections outline the existing transit services and routes in the northwest area that would support
Peak Service.

Flatiron Flyer: The RTD Flatiron Flyer is one of the most successful bus services in terms of regional
connectivity and ridership in the northwest area and connects Boulder to Denver. These routes are in
proximity and could provide connections to several NWR stations (Downtown Westminster, Broomfield –
116th, and the existing Boulder Junction at Depot Square Bus Station). The Flatiron Flyer operates seven
routes; however, four routes have been suspended due to COVID. The three routes currently in service
include:
•

Route FF1: Serves all stations all day, every 15 minutes during peak periods and every 30 minutes during
off-peak periods

•

Route FF3: Operates from Broomfield to Denver Union Station every 15 minutes during peak periods

•

Route FF5: Operates from Downtown Boulder Station to Anschutz during peak periods

The FF Routes would service the US 36 & Sheridan Stations, Boulder Junction at Depot Square Bus Station,
and US 36 & Broomfield Stations providing direct connections to the NWR Corridor.
BOLT: The BOLT Route runs from Boulder to Longmont and serves stops along SH 119. The BOLT operates
every 30 minutes during peak periods and hourly during off-peak periods.
LD/LD1/LD3 Routes: Currently, RTD operates the LD, LD1, and LD3 Routes from Longmont to Denver with
13 stops. The LD provides north-south regional connectivity along US 287 with service to Broomfield,
Lafayette, and Erie. This route departs Union Station, connects to US 287 at Broomfield, and arrives at 23rd
and Main Street only twice daily during evening peak hours. It departs peak stations hourly all day during the
week and weekend. The LD would provide a connection to the Downtown Longmont Station.
FLEX: FLEX provides express transit between Boulder, Longmont, Loveland, and Fort Collins. FLEX is operated
by TransFort and provides connections to the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station and the Downtown
Longmont Station. The FLEX Boulder Express services the following limited stops:
•

Fort Collins: Downtown Transit Center, All MAX Stations, Colorado State University, and South Transit
Center

•

Loveland: 8th Street

•

Longmont: Downtown Longmont and Village at the Peaks Mall

•

Boulder: Boulder Junction Bus Service Area, Downtown Boulder, and University of Colorado

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Regional Express Routes
The current regional bus routes that parallel the NWR Corridor are described below. There are patterns of the
Flatiron Flyer and Route LD to be reinstated with the SOP, as well as the change of the BOLT (and J) into the
CO119 BRT project. These routes are described in the following sub-section.

A one-way trip from Fort Collins to Boulder on this bus service takes approximately 90 minutes.

FlexRide Service
FlexRide provides extended bus service in specific Denver Metropolitan Area, delivering first- and last-mile
connections to other RTD Park-n-Rides and stations, medical centers, and business parks. Similar to a ride
share, FlexRide is available to the general public. Reservations can be made up to 30 days in advance and as
little as ten minutes prior to pick-up time, based on availability. Advanced reservations are recommended, as
space is available on a first-come, first-served basis. For timed meets at RTD stations or Park-n-Rides, no
reservations are needed. All 24 FlexRide zones operate Monday through Friday, generally from 5:30 a.m. to
7:00 p.m.
Routes Serving New NWR Rail Stations
Downtown Westminster Station: The Downtown Westminster Station is relatively well connected to
transit. The transit routes near the Downtown Westminster Station are shown in Figure 22 and Table 21.

Existing Ridership
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted transit ridership for RTD. In 2019, pre-pandemic, RTD saw an annual total
system transit ridership of 105,824,000. On April 19, 2020, service hours for all of RTD’s services were
reduced by approximately 40%, which was a result of a significant decline across all service types due to stayat-home orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a total annual transit system ridership of
52,617,000 in 2020. RTD saw a negative 56% change in total annual light rail ridership from 2019 to 2020 and
a negative 48% change in annual commuter rail ridership from 2019 to 2020.
In 2022, ridership demonstrated signs of recovery. RTD reports that the ridership between 2021 (January to
June) and 2022 (January to June) in all revenue services (bus, access-a-ride, light rail, and commuter rail)
rose by 39%. The Flatiron Flyer alone saw a positive 62% change in this same date range, and combined
commuter rail services saw a positive 40% change. This suggests that a return to higher ridership for RTD
services is likely, and an increase in demand for more regional connectivity could be expected.

Ridership in Northwest Area

Like many of the transit services in the region, the Flatiron Flyer saw a large decline in service hours and
routes. As mentioned previously, four of the seven routes have been suspended. In 2019, pre-pandemic, the
Flatiron Flyer had a total ridership of over 3 million, whereas in 2020, ridership was only just over 1 million. In
2021, Flatiron Flyer annual ridership was 817,000, and between January and June of 2021, it was 304,000.
Between January and June 2022, ridership on the Flatiron Flyer was 492,000, a 62% increase from 2021 in the
same period.

Corridor Conditions Report

In January 2022, Flatiron Flyer had 63,000 monthly boardings, a 55% increase from 2021. The N Line had
62,000 monthly boardings, and the B Line had 10,000 monthly boardings in January 2022. According to the
RTD Regional BRT Feasibility Study, the Flatiron Flyer had the second most annual boardings, surpassed only
by transit on the East Colfax corridor.

Future Transit Network

The Reimagine RTD effort includes the development of a SOP that the RTD Board of Directors adopted on July
26, 2022. The SOP outlines improvements to RTD service within the Denver Metropolitan Area, including the
northwest area.
A key feature of the SOP is categorizing routes into a new travel market-based network of services. The new
service categories are as follows:
•

Core Routes: Regional routes serving prominent employment centers and high-density housing that are
major trip generators with a demonstrated demand for frequent and extensive service hours; the Flatiron
Flyer is a prime example of a Core route

•

Connect Routes: Local bus routes with a minimum 14-hour span of service (6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.),
such as Route 100

•

Commute Routes: Regional routes with limited stops serving unique travel markets (SkyRide and LX are
examples)

•

Community Routes: Community-focused local routes with a custom-built span of service, frequency, and
days of service to meet local needs – examples of community routes are local routes, on-demand services,
and other services, such as the 16th Street Mall Ride

RTD’s SOP network is shown in Figure 28.

rtd-denver.com

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

In its first year of service, pre-pandemic, the N Line was projected to carry over two million riders annually. In
2021, ridership was only 763,000 riders annually. However, in the first half of 2022, ridership has increased. In
2021 and 2022, between January and June, the N Line had a ridership of 294,000 and 447,000, respectively, a
52% increase year over year from 2021 to 2022.

Service to the existing US 36 & Sheridan Station, which is proximate to the Downtown Westminster Station
and the NWR service, would be improved by:
•

The restoration of Route 53

•

Increased frequency to Route FF5, which would run every 30 minutes as opposed to limited trips

•

The restoration of Route FF4

The SOP states that there would be no change to Routes 92 or FF1, which already provide frequent service to
the future Downtown Westminster Station. Route 51 would no longer serve the US 36 & Sheridan Station and
thus would not serve the Downtown Westminster Station.
There may also be opportunities to add FlexRide service focused on providing connections to the bus and rail
stations for the residential neighborhoods surrounding the proposed Downtown Westminster Station during
peak period service and the existing US 36 & Sheridan Station during off-peak periods.

The Broomfield – 116th Station is close to the existing Main & 116th and the US 36 & Broomfield Station; it
would benefit from improved service to each station, as noted in the SOP recommendations. Service to the US
36 & Broomfield Station would benefit the future service improvements to Routes 112 and 120, as well as the
restoration of Routes FF2 and FF4. The US 36 & Broomfield Station would also benefit from the SOP’s
recommended improvements to Route 31, which include breaking up route 31 at the Clear Creek-Federal
Station, improving service reliability, and route operation in the north segment with headways of 30 minutes.
There may also be opportunities to add FlexRide service focused on providing connections to the bus and rail
stations for the residential neighborhoods surrounding the proposed Broomfield – 116th Station during peak
period service and the existing US 36 & Broomfield Station during off-peak periods.

service the same area. Service improvements stated in the SOP to restore the FF4 would directly enhance
service to the Flatiron Station and provide a connection to the NWR Corridor. As indicated in the SOP,
improvements to the AB include restoring Route AB2’s service to and from the Boulder Junction at Depot
Square Station and suggesting headway operating times be 60 minutes in the peak periods all days of the
week. Route AB from the existing Downtown Boulder Station would operate every 60 minutes daily and serve
the US 36 & Flatiron Station, resulting in 30-minute headways between Flatiron Station and Denver
International Airport. Improved service of Route 228 would also provide positive benefits to the Flatiron
Station.

location at 120th/Emma (Boulder County Willoughby Low-Income Housing).) Future service would include 15minute weekday headways along the entire route.
There may also be opportunities to add FlexRide service focused on providing connections to the Rail station
for the residential neighborhoods surrounding the proposed Downtown Louisville Station during peak period
service. Currently, the Louisville FlexRide serves this area.

The SOP outlines service improvements for Routes 324 and BOLT (future SH 119 BRT), which would provide a
close connection to the Downtown Longmont Station. The current LD routes would remain in service with rail
operations in place as the LD serves a separate ridership shed and purpose than the NWR Corridor. The LD
connects Longmont, Erie, Lafayette, and Broomfield, while the NWR Corridor connects Longmont, Boulder,

Corridor Conditions Report

As part of the Longmont ‘Fare-Buy-Up’ program, Routes 324 and 323 are being bought up and paid for by the
City of Longmont and included in the “Ride Free Longmont” program. This has increased ridership, as stated in
the North Team Service Analysis & State Highway 119 BRT Feeder Plan; however, it is unclear if this service
will remain once the SH 119 BRT is in place.
The North Team Service Analysis & State Highway 119 BRT Feeder Plan suggests splitting the existing 323
route into two distinct services to establish a more grid-like network in Longmont. The northern route would
operate 30-minute peak headways and 60-minute non-peak headways, while the southern route would
operate 30-minute headways all day and operate on Sundays, whereas the northern route would not. Both the
north and south routes would access the First & Main Station. This plan also suggests that the 324 would be
split at First & Main into a north and south segment. Both the north and south of this route would also access
the First & Main Station.
There may also be opportunities to add additional FlexRide service, focused on providing connections to the
Rail station for the residential neighborhoods surrounding the proposed Downtown Louisville Station during
Peak Service. Currently, the Longmont FlexRide serves this area.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Network

The US 36 Bikeway has become the backbone of the trail system extending from 80th Avenue in Westminster
to Table Mesa/Foothills Parkway in Boulder. The bikeway was completed in 2016 and offers a 12-foot-wide
concrete path with two-foot shoulders. The bikeway is located on the south side of US 36 from 80th Avenue in
Westminster to West Flatiron Crossing Circle. It crosses under US 36 and connects to Tape Drive near 88th
Street in Louisville and Superior. From there, it generally is located on the north side of US 36 to Table
Mesa/Foothills Parkway in Boulder
At 80th Avenue, the Bradburn Trail extends south to 72nd Avenue and connects with the Little Dry Creek Trail,
connecting to downtown Denver via the Clear Creek Trail and South Platte River Trail. Additionally, there are
connections from the US 36 Bikeway to other trails throughout the corridor.
All the communities along the NWR Corridor contribute to a network of on-street and off-street bicycle
facilities. Additionally, most streets have sidewalks around the stations in both directions to accommodate
pedestrian travel.

Downtown Westminster Station
The US 36 Bikeway begins south of 88th Avenue at Turnpike Drive. South of the US 36 Bikeway, the bike
route connects to other routes which lead to downtown Denver. North of this location, the US 36 Bikeway
provides a direct route to Table Mesa Park-n-Ride in Boulder. Westminster is also constructing an underpass
under Sheridan Boulevard to provide a bicycle and pedestrian connection between the downtown Westminster
development and the US 36 & Sheridan Station. Along 88th Avenue, there are bike lanes in both directions
between Harlan Street and Wadsworth Boulevard. Bike lanes have recently been added to Harlan Street
between 88th Avenue and West 92nd Avenue, which connect with Westminster Boulevard. The bike lanes
continue along Westminster Boulevard to just north of 98th Avenue, connecting to multi-use paths through the
Hyland Ponds Open Space. Figure 29 shows the bicycle routes around the Downtown Westminster Station.
The City of Westminster Transportation and Mobility Plan (City of Westminster, August 2021) shows future
upgrades to the bike lanes along 88th Avenue and West 92nd Avenue and bike lanes being implemented in
the downtown Westminster development. All these upgrades have taken place except for the upgrades along
88th Avenue between Harlan Street and Sheridan Boulevard. This and other connections would be
recommended for the City of Westminster to complete the implementation of the Downtown Westminster
Station as part of the NWR project.
The station offers good pedestrian access to the developing Downtown Westminster area. Sidewalks are on
both sides of 88th Avenue, Harlan Street, Westminster Boulevard, and other roadways within the downtown
Westminster development (Figure 30). Sidewalks along Sheridan Boulevard surround the US 36 & Sheridan
Station, and a pedestrian overpass for transit users and others connects both sides of US 36. Finally, a vacant
lot along 86th Avenue could connect to the station for residents in the neighborhood south of the existing rail
line. This area has a footpath, which also aligns with the station platform. Sidewalk improvements are along
88th Avenue as part of the City of Westminster Transportation and Mobility Plan (City of Westminster, August
2021).

Broomfield – 116th Station
The US 36 Bikeway travels along the south side of US 36 near the Broomfield Event Center and the Arista
Development. The bike route extends south to Westminster and north to the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride in
Boulder. Uptown Avenue and Parkland Street in the Arista development south of US 36 have bike lanes in both
directions. Other roadways through the development have multi-use paths along the roads. Nearer to the
station, bike lanes are located on 112th Avenue east of the rail line, Main Street, and along the southern
portion of Wadsworth Boulevard. However, there are no bike lanes for a stretch as there is significant
construction in the area. Bike lanes pick back up near the Harvest Station Apartments near Wadsworth
Boulevard and Colmans Way. Bike lanes would be completed along this stretch of Wadsworth Boulevard as
developments are completed. Figure 31 shows the bicycle routes around the Broomfield – 116th Station. Other
connections are also in this area's plans for the City and County of Broomfield.
The area closest to the station is a highly fragmented network. Significant sidewalk gaps exist in all directions
from the station, and the street network is not currently very pedestrian friendly. The sidewalk and street
network to the north are better formed to provide walkable access, but this needs to extend closer to the
station. There are sidewalks on both sides of the northern portion of Wadsworth Boulevard; development has
already occurred near the station and throughout the Arista Development south of US 36 (Figure 32). East of
the rail line in the Broomfield Industrial Park, sidewalks are on both sides of the street, especially near the
Broomfield Industrial Park Sports Complex. There is also a pedestrian overpass for transit users and others
that connect both sides of US 36. The side streets north of US 36 and west of Wadsworth Boulevard do not
have sidewalks. As development in this area continues, missing sidewalk links are likely to be completed.

Flatiron Station
The US 36 Bikeway travels along the south side of US 36 near the Flatiron Station. The bike route extends
south to Westminster and north to the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride in Boulder. There are bike lanes in both
directions along Flatiron Crossing Drive, Interlocken Boulevard, Midway Boulevard, and Via Varra. ). Though
the area is largely undeveloped to the northeast, the area west and south of the station and US 36 are not
pedestrian friendly. Routes exist almost solely on the arterial networks with limited crossings in this area, and
the internal neighborhoods (and parking aisles of the shopping center) are largely impenetrable to pedestrians.
However, there is a new crossing under Northwest Parkway near Rock Creek. A pedestrian underpass under
US 36 connects the east and west sides of the US 36 & Flatiron Station. Further, there are numerous
recreational paths through the open space north of Midway Boulevard near the station. Additionally, the City
and County of Broomfield have implemented a new bike path along Industrial Lane with a bicycle overpass
that connects Midway Boulevard, Industrial Lane, and the Interlocken development south of US 36. As
development in this area continues, missing sidewalk links are also likely to be completed.
Figure 33 shows the bicycle routes around the Flatiron Station. Additional routes are being planned by the City
and County of Broomfield around this potential station.
There are sidewalks or multi-use paths along Flatiron Crossing Drive, Interlocken Boulevard, Interlocken Loop/
96th Street, and most local roads throughout the Interlocken area and Flatiron Crossing Mall and Flatiron
Marketplace (Figure 34). Though the area is largely undeveloped to the northeast, the area west and south of

The area to the west of the station offers a very high-quality and permeable network that provides good
access to the station. The area to the east is largely undeveloped, but the developed sliver along the railroad
right of way has a partial network with gaps. There are sidewalks on both sides of the local roadways
throughout most of the downtown Louisville area (Figure 36). However, no sidewalks are near the station
along 96th Street/Courtesy Road. Louisville constructed a pedestrian underpass under the rail line in 2015 at
South Street.

There are sidewalks on both sides of all streets within the Boulder Junction area bound by Valmont Road on
the north, 30th Street on the west, Pearl Parkway on the south, and the rail line on the east; however, these
are not shown in Figure 38. This area is made up of shared-use streets where pedestrians have priority. Two
longer east-west routes connect downtown to the station area, but the north-south routes that flank the
station east and west are further away. This creates obstacles and indirect routing for pedestrians to and from
the station. The figure does show sidewalks along most of the roadways in the area of the Boulder Junction at
Depot Square Station.

Downtown Longmont Station
There are north-south bicycle lanes along Main Street, Terry Street, and Lashley Avenue north of Third
Avenue. There are east-west bicycle lanes along Boston Avenue and Fourth Avenue. There is also a multi-use
path on Third Avenue east of Main Street. Existing bicycle routes do not connect directly to the station area,
but the Coffman Street reconstruction project will add bicycle and improved pedestrian accessibility. Figure 39
shows bicycle routes around the Downtown Longmont Station. Other connections are also being planned by
the City of Longmont to connect multi-use paths and bike lanes to the Downtown Longmont Station as part of
the NWR project.
The downtown core has a high degree of permeability and a relatively continuous pedestrian network.
Connections will need to be made from the station. The area to the south of the rail corridor has several core
main routes and a network of trails, but local streets largely lack sidewalks, and significant gaps are present.
Redevelopment in the immediate station area may resolve the access challenges to the south of the railroad
right of way. There are sidewalks on both sides of Main Street, Boston Avenue, Second Avenue, and Third
Avenue in the immediate area surrounding the Downtown Longmont Station (Figure 40). However, there are
currently no sidewalks along First Avenue. Again, this area is expected to see a great deal of redevelopment in
the coming years, with sidewalks expected to be provided throughout the new development areas.

Existing First and Final Mile Options
The US 36 First and Final Mile Study (Commuting Solutions, 2013) identifies suitable modal options to begin

Recommendations are prepared to utilize a collaborative decision-making process. The Study concluded with
corridor recommendations to strategically implement cost-effective multimodal connectivity projects and
programs between employment locations, activity centers, residences, and future US 36 BRT stations.
The corridor strategies sought to identify ways to enhance transit accessibility in the US 36 corridor. The top
three identified corridor strategies included Bike-n-Ride secure bike parking, First and Final Mile wayfinding
signage, and First and Final Mile EcoPasses. The station area strategies focused on infrastructure
improvements to increase the safety and comfort of people biking or walking to and from the Park-n-Rides.
The strategies included grade-separated crossings of major roadways, connections to the future US 36
Bikeway, enhanced on-street bike facilities, trail extensions or conversions, intersection and midblock crossing
enhancements, and various programmatic and policy strategies.
The Study concluded by providing corridor-wide recommendations, several of which have already been
implemented:
•

•
•
•
•

•

Next Steps

Each of the six new stations is expected to generate new transit demand and interest from bicyclists and
pedestrians. Implementing the NWR Peak Period Service could impact existing transit use and bicycle and
pedestrian patterns, particularly during commuting hours, when NWR Peak Period Service would be
implemented. Potential impacts on the transit system include travel demand and geographic and temporal
transit coverage. The Study Team has started considering how existing and future transit routes may connect
to the new stations, and those recommendations are included in the Transit Corridor Context Report (Appendix
B). The Study Team will also consider how the existing and future bicycle and pedestrian networks can
connect to the stations as project development continues. The Planning and Environmental Study will include a
high-level description of potential impacts and environmental constraints, with further recommendations on
how to proceed during subsequent environmental and design project development steps, as applicable.

Cultural Resources

Historic resources include sites, buildings, structures, objects, and districts that are significant to local, state,
or national history. The significance of historic resources is usually determined by its eligibility for or listing in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), in the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties, or as
locally designated historic landmarks. Types of historic resources within the NWR Corridor include buildings
(single-family homes, commercial storefronts), structures (bridges, culverts, roads), and districts (residential
neighborhoods, commercial downtown areas). For the Study, sites such as building foundations, mines, precontact open camps, and refuse dumps, are discussed in the archaeological and paleontological resources
sections.

Agencies Involved

Multiple federal, state, and local agencies have management or regulatory responsibilities regarding historic
resources. Additional potential stakeholders, including community organizations and descendant groups, retain
an interest in the stewardship of these resources and contribute to the agency's decision-making process.
Potential agency and community stakeholders for historic resources within the planning area include:

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 requires federal agencies to consider the
effects on NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible properties when funding or permitting a project. Under Section 106 of
the NHPA, the lead federal agency determines whether a proposed activity or project constitutes an
undertaking. An undertaking is defined as any action requiring federal funds, permitting, or licensure or occurs
on federal property and has the potential to affect properties listed in or eligible for listing in the NRHP. If the
lead agency determines that a project constitutes an undertaking, the agency defines an Area of Potential
Effects (APE) or the area where an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or
use of historic resources in consultation with the SHPO and identified consulting parties. Once the APE has
been defined, the agency then consults with the SHPO and consulting parties on identifying and evaluating
resources in the APE and potential effects on NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible resources within the APE.

Corridor Conditions Report

NWR Corridor EE in 2010 identified known historic sites and preliminary effects along the corridor. This
assessment provides an updated database of known historic sites within the study area. A file search of site
and resource records at OAHP indicated that there are 116 previous historic resource inventories within the
planning area, mostly comprised of archaeological and architectural surveys. Many of the previous inventories
identified in the OAHP database are over 10 years old and may not meet current OAHP standards for the
recency of cultural resource surveys or did not include properties that may have reached 50 years of age since
then. Correspondence with local landmark commissions identified additional municipal historic resource
surveys that may not be included in OAHP records and site files database. In addition to federal requirements
for managing historic resources, local historic preservation ordinances are an important consideration in the
planning process. While the NHPA is procedural and does not impose substantive legal requirements on federal
agencies beyond considering means to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects on historic properties,
many local historic preservation ordinances impose more explicit preservation mandates for locally designated
landmarks.

Section 4(f) of the CDOT Act (DOT, 1966) prohibits the USDOT from using parks, recreation areas, wildlife and
waterfowl refuges, and historic properties unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative to that use and
the action, includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the property resulting from such use. A use
under Section 4(f) for historic properties is typically triggered by an adverse effect determination under Section
106 of the NHPA or occupancy of a historic property for a transportation purpose.

Corridor Conditions Report

A file search was conducted of records on file with the Colorado OAHP in October 2022 to collect information
on previous surveys and identify historic resources in the study area. Those data were used to identify existing
historic resources, related prior surveys, and NRHP eligibility status. Because the OAHP database can be
incomplete regarding recent surveys or information on local landmarks, seven local landmark commissions
with jurisdictions overlapping the planning area were identified and contacted for information on protected
local landmarks within the study area. The identified landmark commissions include the Boulder County
Historic Preservation Advisory Board, Longmont Historic Preservation Commission, Boulder Landmarks Board,
Louisville Historic Preservation Commission, City and County of Broomfield Historic Landmark Board, Jefferson
County Historical Commission, and Westminster Historic Landmark Board. Of these local historic preservation
authorities, Boulder, Louisville, the City and County of Broomfield, and Westminster contributed data to
supplement the historic resources recorded within the OAHP database.
The Study identifies cultural resources that may be within an Area of Potential Effect that would be determined
as part of the subsequent Section 106 compliance process. The study area for this analysis includes a 1,000foot buffer from the existing BNSF corridor centerline and a 0.5-mile buffer from each new station platform.
This study area captures cultural resources the new rail line would most influence.

Findings/Results

The OAHP file search identified 1,607 known historic resources in the study area. Local landmark data from
municipal historic preservation commissions contributed an additional 92 properties to the known historic
resources within the study area. These local landmarks are often recorded within OAHP records, but this is not
always the case. When a historic resource has been issued a Smithsonian number, documented in OAHP
records, but is also a designated landmark, both designations are counted in Table 35 to reflect the multiple
regulatory contexts (NHPA, local ordinance) under which the resource may be managed.
These historic resources include districts, residential and commercial buildings, roads, railroads, bridges,
transmission lines, culverts, ditches, and public spaces. Table 35 summarizes the NRHP eligibility statuses of
historic resources previously identified and documented in the planning area. Note that “Officially Eligible”
properties have been determined eligible with SHPO concurrence and require the same effects analysis under
Section 106 of the NHPA as NRHP-listed properties. Contributing and non-contributing apply to properties
within an NRHP-listed or Officially Eligible historic district. Field assessments without SHPO concurrence
typically require reevaluation, as do Officially Needs Data properties. Linear resources are treated as NRHPeligible unless the entire resource has been documented and evaluated. Segments of linear resources are
recorded in place of the entire resource and evaluated as supporting or not supporting the eligibility of the
overall linear resource. Historic resources and their relation to the study area are shown in Figure 44 through
Figure 48. Detail maps showing all historic resources within the planning area at 1:24,000 resolution are
available in Appendix C.

Data Collection/Methodology

The planning area includes NRHP-listed, NRHP-eligible, and potentially eligible properties, in addition to
previously identified properties but with no official determination. Several linear historic resources, including
the Burlington Northern Railroad and Colorado & Southern Railroad, run the length of the planning area.
Concentrations of known historic properties are found in the downtown areas of Longmont, Niwot, Louisville,
Broomfield, and Westminster.

Next Steps

During NEPA, the project would also require compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and Section 4(f) of the
CDOT Act, all of which consider effects on historic resources. If the lead federal agency determines a project is
an undertaking under Section 106 of the NHPA, an APE will be delineated specific to the parameters and scope
of that project. Identification and evaluation surveys of historic resources within a project-specific APE may be
conducted to determine what historic resources may be potentially affected by the project. If adverse effects
are determined during Section 106 of the NHPA, the lead agency, in consultation with stakeholders, will work
to avoid, minimize, or mitigate effects.
In addition to federal and state laws and regulations, local agencies have additional ordinances and regulations
that may require compliance or consideration. If possible, design solutions will seek ways to avoid or minimize
impacts on historic properties and designated local landmarks. For alternatives with significant impacts, the
lead agency will discuss practicable alternatives or mitigation. Where avoidance is not possible, effects on
historic resources could delay NEPA clearance and add time to a specific project schedule during and
subsequent to NEPA.

Archaeological and Paleontological Resources
Archaeological

Archaeological resources are defined as material evidence of human activity. They range in time from the precontact period to the modern day. Under current regulations, archaeological resources can be treated as
historic properties if they meet one of the four criteria needed for listing in the NRHP (36 CFR 60.4). For the
current Study, linear resources and their associated features, such as roads, bridges, culverts, and railroads,
are excluded from archaeological resources and discussed alongside historic resources. NWR Corridor EE in
2010 did not note any archaeological resources.
A file search was conducted of archaeological site records on file at OAHP in October 2022. The file search
identified nine known pre-contact archaeological resources and 33 historical archaeological resources within
the planning area. Six of the nine pre-contact resources are classified as isolated finds, and three are
documented as open-camp archaeological sites. Isolated finds are discrete occurrences representing a single
event or activity, typically consisting of individual artifacts or small quantities of artifacts, and are considered
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP by its definition. Of the remaining three archaeological sites, two are
officially not eligible, and one site is unevaluated. The 33 historical archaeological resources include mines,
refuse dumps, artifact scatters, and building foundations. Historic isolated finds and features considered not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP comprise 10 of these resources. Of the remaining historical archaeological
sites, 12 are officially not eligible for the NRHP, and 11 are unevaluated. The need and extent of archaeology
surveys will be determined in the future and based on the scope and design of future projects during
compliance with NEPA and Section 106 of the NHPA. Work will need to stop if an archaeological resource is
discovered during construction, and coordination with the state archaeologist will occur. This could delay the
construction schedule.

Paleontological

A paleontological records search specific to this study area was not conducted. However, OAHP records
contain some paleontological records, and the records search conducted in October 2022 identified one fossil
locality (5BF129) within the planning area. Fossils at the locality comprise Cretaceous-aged plant remains,
including leaves, wood, and stem fragments. No paleontological surveys were completed as part of this
assessment. During NEPA, the need and extent of paleontological surveys will be determined by the projectspecific scope and a review of the Potential Fossil Yield Classification, which classifies geological units based on
the likelihood of finding scientifically important fossils in each unit.
If scientifically important fossils are discovered, they need to be removed from the work site to a repository
museum for further study. Any discovery of a fossil may cause a delay to the schedule and additional
consideration of mitigation requirements.

Parklands, Recreation Resources, Section 4(f), and Section 6(f)
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Recreational resources, including parks, trails, open space areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges are
important community assets that provide environmental, aesthetic, and recreational benefits. Additionally,
these recreational resources may be eligible for protection under Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act and Section
6(f) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. Section 4(f) properties include publicly owned public parks,
recreation areas, wildlife or waterfowl refuges, or any publicly or privately owned historic site listed or eligible
for listing on the NRHP. Although not explicitly mentioned in the regulation, trails/multi-use paths and open
space areas qualify as Section 4(f) resources if they are publicly owned and its purpose is for park, recreation,
or refuge activities. Section 6(f) properties have been funded through Land and Water Conservation Funds,
which provides them special protections against converting their use from that investment.

Agencies Involved

Recreational resources within the corridor are generally owned and operated by local agencies. The USDOT is
responsible for implementing Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) regulations and coordinating with the applicable
local, state, or federal agencies if impacts occur. For Section 6(f) properties, the lead agency would coordinate
with Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW), which administers Section 6(f) coordination on behalf of the National
Parks Service.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Paleontological resources include fossils (the remains and traces of once-living organisms preserved in the rock
record) and the rocks surrounding those fossils that provide context. Because fossil organisms are mostly
extinct, no further fossils of those organisms will ever be formed; therefore, fossils are considered nonrenewable resources protected under various state and federal laws and regulations. NWR Corridor EE in 2010
did not note any paleontological resources.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Section 4(f) was created when the USDOT was formed in 1966. It is codified in Title 49 United States Code
(U.S.C.) Section 303 (Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act of 1966) and Title 23 U.S.C. Section 138, and in
implementing regulations 23 CFR 774. It states:

Section 6(f)(3) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 contains provisions to protect properties
purchased or improved with grants from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Section 6(f) applies to all
transportation projects that could involve the potential conversion of the use of these public outdoor
recreational properties (CDOT, 2017).

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area for this analysis encompasses a 300-foot buffer from the edge of the right of way of the BNSF
corridor and a 300-foot buffer around each station. Colorado Trail Explorer (CoTrex, 2020) trails and trailheads
were downloaded as shapefiles and uploaded into ArcGIS Pro to overlay with the study area. New trail
information was obtained from city and county comprehensive and master plans (City of Westminster
Comprehensive Plan, 2021; City of Louisville Transportation Master Plan, 2019; South Boulder Road Small Area
Plan, 2016; Southeast Longmont Urban Renewal Plan, 2006; Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, 2020; City
and County of Broomfield Comprehensive Plan, 2016). Parklands and open spaces, size, location, and
ownership were obtained from DRCOG Parks and Open Space Layer (DRCOG, 2021). Parks and recreational
resource descriptions were obtained using publicly available data from the respective county or city website.
Section 6(f) data were obtained from CDOT’s Online Transportation Information System database (CDOT,
2022), which tracks properties with Land and Water Conservation funding.

Findings/Results

Recreational resources, including parks, open space properties, conservation easements, trails, and assumed
Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) properties within the study area, are included in Table 36. Figure 46 through
Figure 50 show the locations of these resources.

New trail runs parallel to the track (on the
west side) and connects to more open
space further north (near 104th Avenue).
Lastly, there is a body of water, open
space, and more new trails where the
tracks intersect with US 36. This area is
nestled between Wadsworth Avenue and
the tracks/highway.

Corridor Conditions Report

Several recreational resources exist within the study area. The Planning and Environmental Study will include a
high-level description of potential impacts and environmental constraints, with further recommendations on
how to proceed during subsequent environmental and design project development steps, as applicable. For
the FasTracks program, RTD has mitigated impacts considered high-moderate or above. During NEPA,
additional study areas may be required to consider constructive use. Public parks and recreational facilities are
protected by Section 4(f), which requires that these properties be avoided unless there are no feasible or
practicable alternatives. As design advances, avoidance will be considered an initial option in the next
development phase. If the project cannot avoid using a Section 4(f) property, a Section 4(f) Evaluation will be
required, and concurrence on minimization and mitigation measures from the officials with jurisdiction over the
affected properties will be necessary. Early coordination with officials with jurisdiction will be required.
If it is determined that the project may impact a property protected under Section 6(f), similarly to Section
4(f), design considerations to avoid the property are required. If a conversion of the parkland from a
recreation to a transportation use is necessary, coordination between the CPW and the National Park Service /
US Department of Interior will be required, and replacement parkland will be identified.
To avoid delays, early coordination with applicable agencies and stakeholders will occur at the onset of
preliminary design and NEPA and continue through the alternatives selection process so that concurrence can
be achieved through the Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) processes as efficiently as possible.

Visual and Aesthetic Resources
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Visual resources are components of the visible natural or built environment with aesthetic value. They may be
formally identified by federal, state, or local agencies or be elements that contribute to a memorable or distinct
landscape. Aesthetics are considered in developing new infrastructure projects because they can result in
temporary and permanent changes to visual resources and influence the character of the communities in
which they exist.

Agencies Involved

As the lead agency, RTD coordinates with local and land management agencies to ensure consistency with
visual regulations and requirements applicable to the study area. During the pre-planning stage, RTD
coordinated with these agencies to confirm station locations and identify environmental concerns and
opportunities in the corridor; its engagement would continue throughout the development of the NWR
Corridor.

Next Steps

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

The following regulations and guidelines govern the assessment and consideration of visual quality and
aesthetic character in the study area:
•

•

FTA Circular 9400.1A, Design and Art in Transit Projects: Encourages the uses of design and artistic
considerations in transit projects. The FTA recognizes that specific types of transit projects require an
assessment of visual effects. The Circular guides opportunities for incorporating art and design into transit
projects.

•

The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (PL 109-59),
Sections 6002-6009: Places additional emphasis on environmental considerations such as mitigation,
enhancement activities, context-sensitive solutions, and Section 4(f). It also advances the idea of
coordinating public and agency involvement and promoting visualization techniques to improve stakeholder
understanding of the alternatives.

•

RTD’s Environmental Policies and Procedures Manual Volume I (RTD, 2021): Guides environmental work
on FasTracks projects. Section 3.0, Visual and Aesthetic Resources, informs the methodology for this
analysis.

•

The FHWA Visual Impact Assessment Guidelines (FHWA, 2015): Although developed for highway projects,
these guidelines are easily adaptable for transit and are the widely accepted approach to analyzing visual
impacts for transportation projects.

Local agencies regulate aesthetics through comprehensive plans, municipal codes, and zoning ordinances.
Comprehensive planning documents frequently address aesthetics through policies designed to protect and
promote community character. In turn, municipal code and zoning ordinances address infrastructure,
landscaping, fencing, and screening details, which are likely relevant for station design. Relevant,
comprehensive planning documents include:
•

2040 City of Westminster Comprehensive Plan (City of Westminster, 2021): Chapter 6, Identity and
Design, emphasizes a quality-built environment and strong identity that highlights views and amenities.

•

Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan (Boulder County, 2021): Includes site design specifications to protect
views and contribute to community character; emphasizes views of open space and the Rocky Mountains.

•

Boulder County Comprehensive Plan (Boulder County, 2020): Emphasizes the protection of prominent

natural landmarks and other scenic, visual, and aesthetic resources. Establishes context-sensitive design as
a policy for the design of transportation facilities. A View Protection Overlay District protects views of the
Front Range, although the study area does not currently overlap with the district.
•

Comprehensive Plan 2016 City of Broomfield (City of Broomfield, 2016): Establishes goals for community

adverse environmental impacts, including the destruction or disruption of aesthetic values.

aesthetics as a priority in planning and siting infrastructure. The study area passes through several
planning areas with goals related to the transit system, landscaping, and the aesthetics of new
development (US 36 Sub-Area Plan, Broomfield Interchange Sub-Area Plan, and 96th Street/NW Parkway
Sub-Area Plan).

Envision Longmont Multimodal & Comprehensive Plan (City of Longmont, 2016): Includes planning to

•

accommodate and avoid land use or visual conflicts with the future NWR Corridor and sets goals for
considering aesthetics in site design of transportation and related projects.

The study area for visual and aesthetic resources follows the existing BNSF corridor from Westminster to
Longmont. It extends to areas visible to and from the trackway or stations. Existing visual conditions in the
study area are characterized in terms of the built and natural environment, including land use, scenic features,
vegetation types, landforms, open spaces, and historically and culturally significant resources. The types of
viewers, users, and sensitive receptors in the study area are also defined. A desktop review informs the
analysis of readily available comprehensive planning documents from local agencies, aerial photography, GIS
data, Google Earth, and site visits to identify changes to viewsheds throughout the study area since the Final
NWR Corridor EE. The visual inventory of the study area documents existing conditions through photos and
written descriptions. The results are summarized in this section; details and photos are provided in Appendix

Visual quality is scored as low to high according to the visual harmony and vividness within the landscape.
Areas with high visual quality are associated with harmonious landscapes with a strong sense of unity, order,
and integrity. Areas with moderate visual quality are associated with moderately harmonious landscapes.
These areas include features that are out of scale, relative to each other, and the overall landscape
composition. Areas with low visual quality are associated with inharmonious landscapes reflecting disorderly
composition. Vividness in the landscape is created by visually distinctive or unique focal points and features of
interest that attract attention and create a memorable experience for the viewer.

Findings/Results

The visual character within the study area is variable and defined by industrial and railroad-related uses,
established and newly constructed residential and commercial developments, open space and natural areas,
recreational facilities, transportation infrastructure, and rural/agricultural landscapes and associated
development. The most prominent visual feature in the study area is the Rocky Mountains. In undeveloped
portions of Boulder and Longmont, views of the Rocky Mountains are highly intact. Visual quality ranges from
moderate in Westminster Section to high in portions of the Louisville, Boulder, and Longmont Sections. Viewer
types throughout the study area include workers, residents, recreational users, commuters, and visitors.
Viewer sensitivity is highest in more undeveloped areas between stations and lowest near stations in urban
areas. The analysis results are summarized in the Study section in Table 37. Detailed visual inventory and
representative photographs are provided in Appendix D.

Aesthetic features and visual quality along the BNSF corridor are generally consistent with what is presented in
the Final NWR Corridor EE. Notable changes in development occurred at several station locations where highdensity residential and commercial developments have been recently constructed. Local agencies may modify
station area plans in these areas.

Next Steps

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable.
During NEPA, the impact analysis will assess the degree of visual impact on existing visual quality based on an
evaluation of visual contrast. The focus will be on station areas where new infrastructure has the greatest
potential for visual change. The visual impact of improvements within the NWR Corridor, particularly
surrounding stations, is identified as a community concern through past studies. Continued stakeholder
involvement is recommended as station design evolves.

Air Quality
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Air quality issues are considered in infrastructure planning to determine regional and local transportation

Air quality was assessed within counties serviced by the NWR Corridor, including Adams, Boulder, Broomfield,
Denver, and Jefferson counties. The study area is located within DRCOG’s planning area.
Information on the latest NAAQS nonattainment, maintenance, and attainment designations for the study area
was obtained from the EPA online Green Book website (based on updates through October 31, 2022) (EPA,

the 20-year maintenance planning period unless the maintenance plan specifies that the transportation
conformity requirements apply for a more extended period. According to the EPA Greenbook and the State
Implementation Plan, the 20-year maintenance statuses for carbon monoxide and PM10 lapsed in 2022. As
such, transportation conformity requirements for these pollutants will no longer apply. Therefore, quantitative
carbon monoxide and PM10 hotspot analysis will not be required.

The Study does not intend to select a specific vehicle technology for the proposed service. However, it is
possible that Peak Service on the NWR Corridor could increase diesel trains in the region. At this time, no
vehicle technology is being eliminated from consideration other than overhead catenary system (OCS)
powered electric vehicles. If diesel trains are implemented, the increased mobile source air toxics (MSAT)
emissions from diesel trains could be offset by the vehicle mile travel reduction in the region. Per the 2016
FHWA’s MSAT guidance, NWR will be classified as Tier 1, Project with No Meaningful Potential MSAT Effects or
exempt project because the NWR Corridor will likely reduce traffic volume in the region. The interagency
consultation process for NEPA will confirm the MSAT analysis approaches.
Mitigation for long-term and construction-related air quality impacts will be developed on a project-to-project
basis during NEPA, as applicable. Air quality mitigation measures for construction activities typically involve
dust control measures and ensuring that equipment is properly maintained to eliminate any continuously
visible exhaust emissions.
CDOT’s Clean Transportation Strategic Policy Initiative (CDOT, 2022) will also be considered during the
Planning and Environmental Study and NEPA. Updated CDOT-specific requirements during NEPA will be
incorporated into projects and consistent with the future CDOT Performance Plan FY 2021-2022.
Finally, CDOT’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap pointed out that reducing vehicle miles traveled is
essential to achieving the statewide greenhouse gas target. The NWR Corridor will introduce a viable way to
change transportation from automobile to public transit. Therefore, the NEPA process can point out that the
NWR Corridor can contribute to regional greenhouse gas reduction.

Noise and Vibration
Brief Description of Resource Studied

This section discusses the noise and ground-borne vibration assessments performed to evaluate existing
conditions in the study area. Noise is typically defined as unwanted or excessive sound. Sound becomes
unwanted when it interferes with sleep, speech, or recreation activities. Sound is what we hear when
fluctuations in air pressure occur above and below the standard atmospheric pressure. Three variables define
noise characteristics: level (or amplitude), frequency, and time pattern. Ground-borne vibration consists of
rapidly fluctuating ground motions transmitted into a receptor (building) from a vibration source, such as
transit trains. FTA uses vibration velocity to describe vibration levels for transit projects.

National Ambient Air Quality Standard. However, a conformity demonstration for ozone does not require hot
spot analysis. Rather, it can be demonstrated for a project by documenting that it is included in the latest
approved long-range transportation plan and TIP. The interagency consultation process for NEPA will confirm
the transportation conformity approaches.

Agencies Involved

As the lead agency, RTD coordinates with federal agencies such as FTA and FRA, and state and local agencies
to ensure noise and vibration impacts are properly assessed, disclosed, and appropriate mitigation is
considered.

Corridor Conditions Report
Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Although the NWR Corridor is not in a formal environmental review phase, this analysis uses FTA’s Transit
Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Manual (FTA, 2018) methodology to evaluate noise and vibration.

Sound pressure level is expressed in decibels on a logarithmic scale. Typical sound levels generally fall
between 20 and 120 decibels, similar to the range of human hearing. A three-decibel change in sound level is
widely considered barely noticeable in outdoor environments. A 10-decibel change in sound level is perceived
as a doubling (or halving) of the loudness.
The frequency of sound is the rate at which fluctuations in air pressure occur and is expressed in cycles per
second or hertz. Most sounds consist of a broad range of sound frequencies. The average human ear does not
perceive all frequencies equally. The A-weighted decibel (dBA) scale was developed to approximate how the
human ear responds to sound levels; it mathematically applies less “weight” to frequencies we do not hear
well and more weight to frequencies we do hear well. Typical A-weighted noise levels for various types of
sound sources are summarized in Figure 51:.

Noise Assessment Overview

Packet Pg. 250

B.1.d

Corridor Conditions Report

Human reaction to environmental noise depends on the number of noise events, how long they last, and
whether they occur during the daytime or nighttime. While the maximum noise level provides information
about the amplitude of noise generated by a source, it does not explain how long the noise event lasted. The
sound exposure level is a noise metric that considers how loud a noise source is and how long the event
occurs. The sound exposure level of a noise event is also used to determine cumulative noise exposure over a
one-hour or 24-hour long period.
Analysts use two primary noise descriptors to assess noise impacts from transit projects. They are the
equivalent sound level (Leq) and the day-night sound level (Ldn). The Leq is a mean average noise level often
used to describe sound levels that vary over time, typically for one hour. It is possible to calculate daily
cumulative noise exposure using 24 consecutive one-hour Leq values. The Ldn is a 24-hour cumulative Aweighted noise level that includes all noise that occurs throughout 24 hours, with a 10 dBA penalty on noise
during nighttime (between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.), where sleep interference might be an issue. The 10 dBA
penalty makes the Ldn useful when assessing noise in residential areas, or other land uses where overnight
sleep occurs. The noise analysis performed for this phase of the Study uses the Ldn descriptor.

FTA Transit Noise Impact Criteria

The FTA noise impact criteria are based on well-documented studies regarding community response to noise.
These thresholds are based on the land use of the noise-sensitive receptor and the existing noise level. The Ldn
assesses transit-related noise for residential areas and land uses where overnight sleep occurs (Land Use
Category 2). The one-hour Leq (Leq(h)) assesses impacts at locations with daytime and/or evening use (Land
Use Category 1 or 3), as shown in Table 39.

Severe Impact: In the severe impact range, many people would be highly annoyed by the project noise.
Noise mitigation would normally be specified for severe impact areas unless it is not feasible or reasonable
(meaning there is no practical method of mitigating the impact or mitigation measures are cost-prohibitive).
Moderate Impact: In the moderate impact range, changes in the cumulative noise level are noticeable but
may not be sufficient to cause strong, adverse reactions from the community. In this range, other projectspecific factors are considered to determine the magnitude of the impact and the need for mitigation. Other
factors include the predicted increase over existing noise levels, the types and the number of noise-sensitive
land use affected, existing outdoor-indoor sound insulation, and the cost-effectiveness of mitigating noise to
more acceptable levels.

The FTA noise impact criteria are defined by two curves that allow a varying amount of noise based on the
existing noise level, as shown in Figure 52. Below the lower curve, a project is considered to have no impact
because introducing project noise would result in an insignificant increase in noise level and the number of
people highly annoyed. The two degrees of noise impact defined by the FTA criteria are defined as follows:

vibration. The vibration velocity level is expressed in vibration decibels (VdB) relative to a reference quantity of

Vibration frequency is also expressed in hertz, and the human response to vibration generally falls between six
and 200 hertz. Human response to vibration is a function of the average motion over a period of time, such as
one second. Human response to vibration also roughly correlates to the number of daytime vibration events.
The more events that occur, the more sensitive humans are to vibration. Figure 53 illustrates common
vibration sources and associated human and structural responses to ground-borne vibration.

vibration level in residential areas is usually 50 VdB or lower—well below the threshold of perception for
humans, around 65 VdB. Annoyance occurs for frequent transit events at vibration levels over 70 VdB.

a
Frequent events are defined as more than 70 vibration events of the same source per day. Most rapid transit projects
fall in this category.
b
Occasional events are defined as between 30 and 70 vibration events of the same source per day. Most commuter rail
trunk lines have this many operations.
c
Infrequent events are defined as fewer than 30 vibration events of the same kind per day. This category includes most
commuter rail branch lines.

The Category 1 criteria limits are based on acceptable levels for most moderately sensitive equipment, such as optical
microscopes. Vibration-sensitive manufacturing or research would require detailed evaluation to define acceptable
vibration levels. Vibration-sensitive equipment is generally not sensitive to ground-borne noise.

Data Collection/Methodology

The noise and vibration analyses performed for this project are based on FTA noise and vibration impact
assessment methods. FTA’s methodologies consist of a screening assessment in which analysts determine if
noise- or vibration-sensitive land uses are close enough to the new alignment to merit an impact assessment.
If so, the next step in FTA’s methodologies is a general noise and vibration analysis. There is also a third level
of FTA impact assessments, which examines noise and vibration in detail, but those were not applied to this
project.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

FTA identifies separate criteria for both ground-borne vibration and ground-borne noise. Ground-borne noise is
often masked by airborne noise; therefore, criteria are primarily applied to subway operations where airborne
noise is negligible (and would not be evaluated in this assessment). FTA differentiates vibration-sensitive land
uses into three distinct categories—similar but not identical to the noise-sensitive land use categories, as
shown in Table 40. The vibration thresholds vary based on land use and the frequency of the vibration events.

In the screening assessments, FTA directs analysts to select noise and vibration screening distances
corresponding to the type of transit vehicle a project proposes to implement. The noise screening distances
represent the distance at which each type of transit vehicle would result in a noise level of 50 dBA, so louder
diesel-electric locomotives have larger screening distances than quieter streetcars. This project has not yet
selected the transit vehicle type. The Study Team selected conservative screening distances and determined
that noise- and vibration-sensitive land uses exist close to the project corridor (the only goal of the screening

For this report, estimated existing noise levels using two FTA methods are reported. The Study Team also
calculated existing ground-borne vibration levels associated with freight train activity, plotted vibration
contours, and identified where existing ground-borne vibration levels are likely to exceed FTA thresholds for
residential land uses. That vibration assessment aims to provide project planners with a high-level review of
where project-related vibration impacts are most likely to occur. The analysis of project-related noise and
vibration will be reported in the next phase of this Study.

Noise Assessment

RTD has not finalized the type of transit vehicle likely to be procured. Therefore, the Study Team selected the
FTA default noise screening distance of 750 feet for a commuter rail mainline. Noise screening results
determined that there are Category 2 noise-sensitive land uses within that distance. On that basis, existing
noise levels are estimated for later comparison with project-related noise levels.
Within the study area, existing noise sources include the BNSF rail traffic along the existing railway and traffic
noise from major roads and highways, including US 36 and SH 119, which run parallel to the railway through
much of the NWR Corridor. Additional noise sources include general community noise (lawn mowing,
conversations between neighbors) and natural sounds (birds, insects, wind).
The Study Team estimated existing noise levels using two methods: noise exposure assessment according to
methodology from Table 4-17 of the FTA “Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment” manual, and an
analysis of freight rail noise using the FTA/FRA module in the Cadna-A three-dimensional noise modeling
software.
Table 4-17 of the FTA guidance document estimates existing Ldn at a receptor based on the receptor’s distance
from four-lane highways, other major roadways, and railways; and based on the area's population density.
The Study Team used Esri ArcMap GIS software to determine the distance to the nearest major road or
highway and railway for all locations within two miles of the NWR Corridor. Additionally, the Study Team
identified population density in the area using 2020 Census data from the United States Census Bureau. The
Study Team used this information to develop an existing noise estimate for each source category (roads,
railways, and population) for the entire study area, as well as an overall estimate that is the maximum
resulting estimated Ldn from the three sources.
The Study Team modeled existing freight rail traffic using Cadna-A. Cadna-A is a three-dimensional noise
modeling software that incorporates equations from ISO 9613-2 “Acoustics – Attenuation of Sound during
Propagation Outdoors” and equations for train noise from FTA’s Transit Noise and Vibration Impact
Assessment Manual (2018). The Study Team used Cadna-A to calculate sound propagation from the railway
and resulting noise levels throughout a Cartesian coordinate grid in the noise study area.

steps). Therefore, when project-related effects are evaluated, FTA’s general noise and vibration impact
assessments will be performed.

The FTA equations built into Cadna-A use the number of locomotives and railcars, train speed, train type, and
track construction to calculate a noise level associated with a passing train. The assumed values for each
parameter are as follows:
•
156

Train Type: Conventional Freight

Corridor Conditions Report

Locomotive horn use at public at-grade crossings is a major source of noise associated with rail traffic. To
accurately reflect the existing noise levels, the Study Team added horn noise to the modeled train at locations
where trains are within 20 seconds of an at-grade crossing, based on the train speed. The Study Team did not
model horn noise at crossings denoted as quiet zones by local jurisdictions and in the FRA’s Highway/Rail
Crossing Database (FRA, 2020).
After defining the train parameters, the Study Team input the number of trains per hour to account for the
fact that train noise is only audible intermittently when a train passes by a receptor. Six freight trains are
expected per day to pass through the NWR Corridor, or an average of 0.25 trains per hour.
Cadna-A can account for the acoustic characteristics of the ground cover and terrain shielding in the noise
propagation path. The Study Team configured the model to treat the ground as 60% acoustically absorptive
and imported a digital terrain model for this analysis. Based on the described inputs, Cadna-A calculated
existing freight rail traffic-related day-night noise levels at each intersection on a Cartesian coordinate grid and
then created noise contour lines representing the existing Ldn.
Finally, the Study Team overlayed the two existing Ldn maps created using the above methods and created a
new map showing the maximum estimated Ldn from the two data sets.

Vibration Assessment

Both locomotives and passenger vehicles create vibration. For commuter trains, the highest vibration levels are
typically created by the locomotives. Electric commuter rail vehicles create ground-borne vibration levels
comparable to electric rapid transit vehicles. The Study Team selected FTA’s default screening distance of 200
feet for a conventional commuter railroad and confirmed there is Category 2 vibration-sensitive land use within
that screening distance.
Therefore, the Study Team performed FTA’s general vibration assessment to evaluate existing ground-borne
vibration conditions associated with BNSF freight trains (the dominant source of ground-borne vibration) in the
NWR Corridor. The first step is determining the frequency of events and corresponding category, and
locomotives and railcars are evaluated separately. This analysis assumed there are six BNSF trains per day,
and each train has three locomotives and 100 railcars; therefore, there are 18 locomotives and 600 railcars
daily. Table 41 presents FTA’s event frequency definitions for Category 2 land uses.

The Study Team calculated ground-borne vibration velocities using FTA equations for freight locomotives and
railcars. Per FTA guidance, the Study Team adjusted the vibration levels from a reference speed of 50 mph to
the four freight train speeds in this corridor (20, 25, 30, and 49 mph). The Study Team applied a 5 VdB
adjustment accounting for jointed rail throughout the corridor. The Study Team applied a 10 VdB adjustment
where crossovers or turnouts (special trackwork) exist and limited the resulting contour to 200 feet per FTA
guidance. Analysis results determined that the distance to the vibration impact contour was greater for
locomotives with and without special trackwork than for railcars under either track condition. Table 43 shows
the resulting distances to the vibration impact contour for each speed regime for Category 2 land uses.

events. These definitions are then used to identify the corresponding vibration impact thresholds for each
frequency of event category and land use category. FTA’s general vibration assessment methodology uses the
following three land use categories.

Using GIS technology, the Study Team plotted vibration contours based on the distances shown above. Where
special trackwork exists, the Study Team plotted a circular contour (i.e., a point source) and merged it with
the other contours. Using GIS technology, the Study Team created figures that used color shading to indicate
where these contours overlapped residential parcels.

Findings/Results

Under FTA guidelines, as existing noise levels increase, the incremental amount of noise that projects can
make (before noise impact occurs) decreases. FTA’s noise impact thresholds utilize a sliding scale to limit
overall noise levels (existing plus project-related). Under FTA guidelines, if a project exceeds its allowable
incremental increase, noise impacts occur and are categorized as either moderate or severe depending upon
the overall level of project-related noise relative to the noise impact thresholds.
In the next phase of this Study, parcels where overnight sleep occurs are identified and project-related noise is
determined at those locations. Project-related noise is compared with existing noise levels, and potential noise
impacts are identified and categorized as moderate or severe per FTA. FTA guidance requires mitigation to be
considered for moderate noise impacts and implemented for severe noise impacts. Projects can define costeffectiveness thresholds or other performance criteria for noise mitigation. It is not uncommon for noise
impacts in the lower range of moderate noise impacts are not mitigated. This could occur if the margin of
noise impact is quite small, and the cost of mitigation per decibel reduced is determined to be unsatisfactory
or cost-prohibitive. Often the upper range of moderate noise impacts are mitigated. Figure 55 through Figure
59 show the existing vibration contours and where Category 2 land uses occur within those contours. In the
next phase of this Study, project-related vibration velocities are determined and used to evaluate the potential
increase above existing vibration levels. That information is then compared with FTA vibration impact
thresholds. The analysis would determine where vibration impacts, as defined by FTA, have the most potential
to occur when the NWR Corridor is implemented. The analysis would include discussing potential mitigation
measures for projected vibration impacts.
If the project advances into an environmental assessment phase, the noise and vibration analyses would
evaluate noise and vibration at parcels in all three FTA land use categories and at “special buildings” locations
like recording and broadcast studios. This analysis focused on lands where overnight sleep occurs to simplify
the assessments and provide an initial order of magnitude estimate of potential noise and vibration impacts on
a level commensurate with the amount of engineering detail available to decision-makers.

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable. During NEPA, noise and vibration will be evaluated at
parcels in all three FTA land use categories and at “special buildings” locations like recording and broadcast
studios. This analysis will focus on lands where overnight sleep occurs to simplify the assessments and provide
an initial order of magnitude estimate of potential noise and vibration impacts on a level commensurate with

Mineral Resources, Geology, and Soils
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Geologic resources are evaluated with a focus on the ability to withstand and support the NWR Corridor during
construction and operations. This section describes the existing soils, geologic resources, and seismicity within
the NWR Corridor.

Agencies Involved

RTD and BNSF are the two organizations with authority over the construction, operation, and maintenance of
new infrastructure within the existing soil and geology for all trackwork. Each of the local municipalities would
have similar authority for the station areas.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

Geotechnical investigations and design recommendations for the NWR Corridor would be completed in
accordance with the CDOT Geotechnical Design Manual (CDOT, 2021), FHWA Geotechnical Technical Guidance
Manual (FHWA, 2007), BNSF Standard Specifications (BNSF, 2019), and RTD Commuter Rail Design Criteria
(RTD, 2009).

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area for this analysis is a 1,000-foot buffer from the existing BNSF corridor centerline and a 0.5-mile
buffer from each new station platform. The assessment identifies known and potential mineral, soil, and
geology resources within the NWR Corridor, such as oil, gas, coal, aggregate, and other mineral commodities.

Findings/Results

The study area consists of broad mesas, linear ridges, and gently rolling hills interspersed with swales, ravines,
and flat terrain. The underlying bedrock varies from thick silty shale to interbedded and lenticular sandstone,
siltstone, claystone, shale, and lesser amounts of conglomerate. Depth to bedrock is variable, but areas of
shallow bedrock are common across the study area. The water table may occur in unconsolidated deposits or
bedrock. Groundwater seeps may occur in bedrock that is close to the ground surface. Depth to the water
table is highly variable across the study area, but it is generally shallow in the Louisville, Boulder, and
Longmont Sections.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Next Steps

The study area's soil is dominated by sandy and clay loams, locally with gravel or cobbles. Thin sandy deposits
are common in significant drainages. Thicker sand and gravel deposits line major drainages and cap mesas

across the area. Widely occurring soil problems include moderate to high shrink-swell potential (Figure 60),
moderate to high corrosivity to untreated steel (Figure 61), low to moderate corrosivity to concrete (Figure
62), shallow bedrock, susceptibility to differential settlement, susceptibility to piping, and low to moderate
erosion potential (Figure 63). Some soils are affected by very shallow seasonal water tables and flooding.

The risk of subsidence over shallow abandoned coal mines is limited to the western margin of the Broomfield
and Louisville Sections because the other areas are not undermined. Oil and gas resources are widely
distributed in the Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, and Longmont Sections.
Colorado recognizes separate ownership of surface and mineral estates, meaning that owners of mineral rights
can exercise its option to develop mineral resources, even where others own the surface land.

NEPA, soil or mineral impacts will be evaluated if soil or mineral impacts that could require mitigation could
occur. The impacts evaluated will include total acres of soil disturbance, impacts to prime farmland, and
effects that could prevent future access to mineral deposits. The assessment will focus on conditions that are
notable for consideration during subsequent environmental and design steps. Geologic and soil resources will
be evaluated with a focus on their susceptibility to erosion and ability to withstand and support the
infrastructure during construction and operations.

Hazardous Materials
Brief Description of Resource Studied

The acquisition of property right of way and potential construction disturbance requires the evaluation of
hazardous material concerns to protect worker health and safety and public health, to provide liability due
diligence for the purchasing entity, and improve the alternatives analysis based on potential hazardous
material impacts.
Hazardous material sites are those properties that have been impacted by a current or previous use that could
have resulted in a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products. These materials could include
pesticides, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, petroleum products (gasoline, diesel
fuel, lubricants), lead-based paint, and asbestos-containing building materials.

Agencies Involved

Agencies involved with the regulation of hazardous materials are:
•

United States EPA

•

CDPHE, Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division

•

Local agencies such as cities and counties that own right of way or sites

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans
•

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980

This assessment of existing conditions is focused on major hazardous material sites that may influence
alternative development or have major cost ramifications. Therefore, the following sites were not considered
an environmental concern:

A no action determination is given when the property owner indicates the existence of contamination that does
not exceed state standards or contamination that does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health and the
environment. A no action determination also indicates contamination originates from a source on, adjacent, or
nearby, and the entity responsible would take necessary action to address the contamination. For purposes of
the Study, these sites are not considered major sites.
The major hazardous materials sites evaluated included large federally listed sites, corrective action sites,
brownfield sites, designated VCRP sites, and historic landfills. Evaluation of these sites included site location
within the study area, type of database listing, present or historical status of the site, and professional
judgment.

The EDR database listed 2,545 mapped site identification locations with 3,537 separate database listings, as
sites may have more than one database listing. Each mapped site identification location may also contain
multiple site names and addresses due to historical name and address changes and address overlapping.
Because of the high number of sites, only the sites within the study area were evaluated. This resulted in

and design project development steps, as applicable. RTD will complete a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment (ESA) during NEPA. Based on the Phase I ESA findings, if a Phase II ESA (i.e., materials testing)
or remediation activities are required, there may be substantial delays for property acquisition or construction
in the vicinity. Also, a Phase II ESA and remedial activities could require additional funding. These activities are
associated with the acquisition of properties.
Hazardous materials concerns within the construction area will require specifications to guide contractors
regarding safety precautions, protocols, and environmental commitments. A Materials Management Plan will be
used if construction activities are anticipated to encounter hazardous materials.

Energy
Brief Description of Resource Studied

This section describes the existing energy consumption by RTD throughout its service area and provides the
basis for later determining the NWR Corridor’s long-term effects on energy consumption.

Agencies Involved

Information was gathered from RTD to determine the amount of energy expended by the existing bus and rail
service in the RTD Region.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

At the federal level, the Council on Environmental Quality regulations at 40 CFR 1502.16(e) requires the
consideration of “energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation
measures” of the proposed action.

Data Collection/Methodology

Transportation energy is generally discussed in terms of direct energy used to operate the NWR Corridor.
Direct energy involves the energy consumed by transit vehicles for propulsion (including trains and buses) and
automobiles in the corridor. This energy is a function of operating characteristics such as distance traveled or
operating hours and the fuel's thermal value. Data collection efforts focused on documenting the existing
energy needs in the corridor. Energy outputs in terms of fuel usage would be calculated in British Thermal
Units (BTUs). The study area for energy would begin at the RTD service area, including all bus and rail routes.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Next Steps

The Study Team assessed the existing energy conditions via a review of readily available documents and
utilized applicable information from RTD’s previous studies on the NWR Corridor. The information reviewed
included annual light rail, commuter rail, and bus operating miles calculated from RTD’s Quality of Life report
(2020) (Table 45), the National Transit Database, (and modeled output will be used for the year 2030 for the
Planning and Environmental Study). For comparison, it takes 3,906 BTUs to move a car one mile, assuming 32
miles per gallon.

Biological Resources

Biological resources include wildlife and vegetation that reside or use the study area and wildlife habitats.
Though largely under the direct or indirect influence of development, the study area includes rural and urban
wildlife habitats and natural and disturbed vegetation. This section presents the general habitat types and
common and special-status species that may occur. For the Study, habitat would serve to evaluate wildlife
presence and vegetation composition.

Agencies Involved

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and CPW are the primary regulatory agencies involved with
biological resources. The agencies guide special-status species, reviewing and authorizing impacts if
applicable, and administer federal and state policies. Some municipalities have wildlife management plans
specific to that local area administered at that level, e.g., Boulder County prairie dog management plan
(Boulder County, 2022), so local agencies may also be involved in biological resources.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

The following regulations and guidance are specific to special-status plants and wildlife and its habitats in the
study area:
•

Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-712)

•

Federal Executive Order 13186 – Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds

•

Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)

Corridor EE. General habitat types are not expected to differ greatly from those findings; however, updating
that dataset is recommended.

CPW maintains a list of special-status species tracked by the agency (CPW, 2022a) and makes a distribution of
select species available for review (CPW, 2022b). The data were reviewed for those species potentially present
within the habitats of the study area.

Findings/Results
Federally Listed Species

The IPaC report finds six federally listed species with the potential to occur within the study area (Table 47).
Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse is not known to occur within the study area south of Baseline Road (USFWS,
2004); however, suitable habitat is present to the north. Recent trapping data are not publicly available.
The study area contains watersheds known to contain Greenback Cutthroat Trout. The presence of the species
within the actual study area is unlikely. Ongoing efforts to restore Greenback Cutthroat Trout may include
waters within the study area; additional consultation with wildlife agencies would identify potential conflicts.
The Monarch Butterfly was proposed as a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act in
May 2022 (Department of the Interior, 2022). This species or its habitat (host plants) would likely occur within
the study area. Though not afforded the same full protection of the Endangered Species Act, Candidate
species are often treated as such for planning purposes. Additional consultation with the USFWS regarding the
Monarch Butterfly would be necessary.
Ute Ladies'-tresses and Western Prairie Fringed Orchid may occupy the study area’s moist meadows,
floodplains, and habitats. Further habitat evaluation is necessary to determine the potential presence, followed
by targeted surveys if warranted.
There are no designated critical habitats within the study area.

wildlife resources (e.g., listed species, critical habitats) that may be affected by a proposed activity. An IPaC
report was generated for those resources within the study area, and the species were evaluated for the
potential to occur (USFWS, 2022).

State-Listed Species

CPW list tracks state-sensitive species with some overlap of the Endangered Species Act-listed species. Public
distribution data for all state-listed species is incomplete. Available fish data indicate Common Shiner (Luxilus
cornutus, Threatened) and Iowa Darter (Etheostoma exile, Concern) may occur in study area watersheds.
Amphibian data show Northern Leopard Frog (Rana pipiens, Concern) is known within the Boulder Creek and
Left Hand Creek drainages.
Other state-listed species have the potential to occur, e.g., Burrowing Owl (Athene cuniculalria, Threatened;
Black-tailed Prairie Dog, Cynomys ludovicianus, Concern), but lack data to confirm. Additional consultation with
CPW is necessary to ensure the study tracks species or habitats of state concern.

Migratory Birds

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects most avian species from disturbance, including nesting. All but the most
developed industrialized areas of the study area offer some nesting, foraging, or resting habitats. Riparian and
shrub habitats are expected to support nesting birds, including raptors. Active nests would be protected from
disturbance, and active raptor nests have established avoidance buffers (CPW, 2020).

Habitat and Vegetation

The study area is dominated by developed lands (industrial/commercial and residential) and grasslands.
Smaller areas of aquatic habitats (wetlands and open water) are present throughout, as shown in Table 48. No
native prairie is present; all habitats have been modified by human activity to some degree. Several habitats
are primarily derived from human activities and lack quality wildlife habitat. The most natural areas occur
along streams, rivers, and other wet areas, including riparian shrub, riparian woodland, and marsh habitat.
Linear corridors of riparian vegetation that provide habitat and movement opportunities are relatively
uncommon in the overall developed setting of the study area and are considered sensitive.

South Platte River are considered high-priority habitat for white-tailed deer and moderate-priority habitat for
mule deer (URS, 2010). Mountain lion (Felis concolor) and black bear (Ursus americanus) may occasionally
travel through riparian corridors in the Boulder and Longmont Sections. Medium-sized mammals present in the
study area include American badger (Taxidea taxus), coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), gray fox
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon
(Procyon lotor) and common porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) (URS, 2010).

Next Steps

During NEPA, habitats will be confirmed with field verification; no substantial changes in the overall habitat
composition are expected. Additionally, sensitive resources such as prairie dog colonies and raptor nests will
be documented.
Consultation with the USFWS and CPW is necessary to determine those species and habitats likely to occur
within or be impacted by activities in the study area. Specifically, the need for further Preble's Meadow
Jumping Mouse analysis (habitat assessment, trapping surveys) and the Monarch Butterfly assessment
approach will be determined.
Potential habitats for Ute Ladies'- tresses and Western Prairie Fringed Orchid would be documented during
that survey. Consultation with USFWS may indicate the need for species-specific surveys for these species
during the July through August flowering period.
Effects on wildlife and its habitats would be assessed by overlaying impacts with documented resources.
Impacts, depending on its nature and extent, may require mitigation.

Farmlands
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Prime and unique farmland and farmland of statewide or local importance are protected under the Farmland
Protection Policy Act of 1981 to minimize the extent that federal programs contribute to the unnecessary and
irreversible conversion of farmland to non-agricultural uses. The three categories of protected farmland
include:
•

Prime Farmland. Land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for
producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops can economically produce sustained high yields of
these crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming practices

•

Unique Farmland. Land other than prime farmland used to produce specific high-value food and fiber
crops; it can economically produce sustained high yields of these specialized crops when treated and
managed according to acceptable farming practices

•

Farmland of Statewide or Local Importance. Land that has either been identified as having statewide
importance according to criteria determined by the Colorado State Experiment Station, the Colorado State
Department of Agriculture, or the Colorado State Soil Conservation Board, or land that may have local
significance based on the goals of the community and of the various agricultural enterprises that maintain
a viable agricultural community

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable.

Developed land or land already committed to development and land within the existing right of way is
excluded from protection under the Farmland Protection Policy Act because these lands are developed and
considered unavailable for agricultural production.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans
Farmland resources are governed by the following:
•

NEPA, 23 CFR 771, and 40 CFR 1500-1508): NEPA (42 U.S.C. Section 4231) requires that all actions
sponsored, funded, permitted, or approved by federal agencies undergo planning to ensure that
environmental considerations, such as impacts to farmland, are given due weight in decision-making. The
federal implementing regulations are 23 CFR 771 (FHWA) and 40 CFR 1500-1508 (Council on
Environmental Quality).

•

Farmland Protection Policy Act of 1981 (7 U.S.C. 4201-4209): The purpose of the Farmland
Protection Policy Act is to minimize impacts on farmlands and maximize compatibility with state and local
farmland programs. Farmlands are classified as prime, unique, or of statewide or local importance. Projects
completed by a federal agency or with assistance from a federal agency are subject to Farmland Protection
Policy Act requirements if they may irreversibly convert farmland (directly or indirectly) to non-agricultural
use.

•

7 CFR § 658: Guidelines for Implementing the Final Rule of the Farmland Protection Policy Act
for Utility Line, Highway, Railroad, Stream Improvement, and Flood Control System Projects:
The guidelines were developed by the Secretary of Agriculture in cooperation with other federal agencies,
pursuant to Section 1541(a) of the Farmland Protection Policy Act 7 U.S.C. 4202(a). As required by Section
1541(b) of the Farmland Protection Policy Act and 7 U.S.C. 4202(b), federal agencies are (a) to use the
criteria to identify and take into account the adverse effects of its programs on the preservation of
farmland, (b) to consider alternative actions, as appropriate, that could lessen adverse effects, and (c) to
ensure that its programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with state and units of local agencies
and private programs and policies to protect farmland.

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area to calculate farmland impacts is a 1,000-foot buffer from the centerline of the corridor and a
1,000-foot buffer from stations.
Before farmlands are used for a federal project, an assessment would be completed to determine if prime,
unique, statewide, or locally important farmlands would be converted to non-agricultural uses. If the
assessment determines that farmland use exceeds the parameters set by the Natural Resources Conservation
Service, then the federal agency would take measures to minimize the impacts on these farmlands.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The following agencies are involved in the evaluation of farmland within the study area:

Lands committed to urban development are not considered farmland under the Farmland Protection Policy Act
because they are generally developed with impermeable (paved) surfaces unavailable for agricultural
production. These lands are identified in the Census 2020 “urbanized areas” (United States Census Bureau,
2020). In addition, local plans were reviewed to determine the areas in the study area that are considered

urban based on land use and zoning ordinances. Land identified in the plan as commercial, high-density
residential, or industrial land use was considered urban.
The data used to calculate the potentially impacted farmland was the US Soil Survey Geographic Database
from the National Cooperative Soil Survey, completed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Natural Resources Conservation Service soil data is used to identify protected farmland within the study area.
As shown in Figure 65, the Denver, Adams, and Westminster Sections are highly urbanized, with no prime,
unique, or statewide or locally important farmland. There is farmland in the remaining four Sections
considered either prime if certain conditions are met (i.e., are irrigated, drained, or protected from flooding) or
farmland of statewide importance.
There are approximately 1,000 acres of prime farmland within the study area and approximately 150 acres of
farmland of statewide importance. There is no unique farmland or farmland of local importance within the
study area.

Next Steps

During NEPA, a Form CPA-106 will be completed and submitted to the Natural Resources Conservation Service
field offices that serve the study area. This form calculates impacts on farmlands under two methods. The first
identifies the total amount of prime, unique, or statewide or locally important farmland within the study area;
it compares the converted amount of farmland to the total available farmland. The second method addresses
the type of farmland impacts that could occur. The result is a score of up to 260 points representing the value
of the impacted farmland. If the score is less than 160, no further action is required. For projects where the
total points are equal to or exceed 160, the Farmland Protection Policy Act suggests the agency consider
alternative actions, as appropriate, that could reduce impacts.

Wetlands and Waters of the United States
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Aquatic resources are surface waterbodies and wetlands, both constructed and natural. These include streams,
ponds, and roadside ditches, as well as any adjacent wetlands, and are collectively referred to as ‘waters.’
Within the largely urbanized study area, waters provide stormwater conveyance and retention, recreation,
ecological functions, agricultural use, and wildlife habitat.
Wetlands are defined by the USACE (33 CFR 328.3, 1986) and EPA (40 CFR 230.3, 1980) as “areas that are
inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and that
under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions.” State and federal agencies regulate wetlands and other waters of the U.S.

Agencies Involved

The primary regulatory agencies involved with aquatic resources are the USACE, in cooperation with the EPA.
CDPHE oversees state water quality concerns. CPW advises on the ecological and wildlife habitat aspects of
waters.

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

The following regulations and guidelines govern the assessment and consideration of aquatic resources in the
study area:
•

Section 404 Clean Water Act – Administered by the EPA and USACE, the Clean Water Act regulates the
discharge and dredging of materials within waters of the U.S.; impacts to waters would be authorized
pursuant to the Clean Water Act

•

Section 401 Clean Water Act – Administered by CDPHE, Section 401 provides a state review of actions
proposed under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act

Corridor Conditions Report

The study area for wetlands and other water features is a 300-foot-wide buffer on each side of the edge of the
existing BNSF right of way and new station locations. The study area was surveyed in 2006 and 2008 for
wetlands and waters (URS, 2010) used for the Final NWR Corridor EE. The National Wetland Inventory
(USFWS, 2022) was reviewed relative to the 2010 data and current aerial images; however, it is ineffective at
the required scale. Though dated, the 2010 survey remains the most current inventory of waters. The 2010
evaluation did not survey the NWR maintenance facility sites. These areas likely contain wetlands. A field
survey would be required to confirm wetlands at the NWR maintenance facility sites.

Findings/Results

The results of the 2010 survey are shown in Figure 66 through Figure 70 and summarized in Table 49 and
Table 50 (URS, 2010). Current National Wetland Inventory data locate larger waterbodies and its adjacent
wetlands (e.g., Dry Creek and Boulder Creek); however, smaller features captured by the survey are absent
and would underrepresent the resource. Therefore, the 2010 data is carried forward for this Study. A
comparison of this data to current aerial imagery suggests that a few small wetlands have been impacted in
the intervening years. Several small wetlands around Louisville, Broomfield, and Longmont appear to have
been filled, totaling about half an acre.

Corridor Conditions Report

During the completion of the Planning and Environmental Study, an aquatic resources survey will be conducted
to bring the 2010 baseline data to current delineation standards and provide data for the NWR maintenance
facility sites. Methods will follow the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental
Laboratory, 1987) and the Great Plains Supplement (USACE, 2010a). A portion of the study area around
Boulder lies within the Western Mountains, Valleys, and Coast Region (USACE, 2010b). The USACE will be
consulted regarding the appropriate survey methodology. Wetlands are identified by field indicators
(hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetland hydrology). Wetlands meeting the criteria will be
documented on wetland determination data forms and mapped with sub-meter GPS. Non-wetland waters will
be mapped using ordinary high watermark guidance applicable to the region, e.g., Mersel and Lichvar 2014, or
similar as directed by the USACE. Consultation with the USACE will direct methodologies, including the
application of Functional Assessment of Colorado Wetlands to some wetlands. An Approved Jurisdictional
Determination may be prepared following the aquatic resources survey, depending on USACE consultation.
In 2010, the USACE requested a wetland functional assessment of a subset of wetlands in the study area. The
Functional Assessment of Colorado Wetlands Methodology was applied to 11 wetlands (Johnson et al., 2013).
The USACE will be consulted to confirm if wetland analysis will be required for the aquatic resources survey
and subsequent impact assessment.
During NEPA, the assessment will rely on the overlay of potential impacts on the aquatic survey results. Early
collaboration with design will enable the identification of opportunities for avoidance and minimization of
impacts. Any remaining impacts will require Clean Water Act compliance with the USACE.

Water Resources and Water Quality
Brief Description of Resource Studied

Water resources include surface water and groundwater features such as rivers, lakes, streams, creeks, wells,
and aquifers. Transit and transportation projects have the potential to impact drainage, water quality, and
water resources used for drinking, recreation, agriculture, and habitat. These impacts can occur during both
the construction and maintenance/operation phases. Although wetlands and floodplains are also considered
water resources, they are discussed separately in the Wetlands and Waters of the United States and
Floodplains Sections, respectively.

Agencies Involved

The primary agency involved in assessing water resources and quality is the CDPHE Water Quality Control
Division, which oversees state water quality concerns in cooperation with federal standards, including the
Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act established by the EPA. Local agencies also regulate water
quality resources through permitting and development reviews.

Corridor Conditions Report

The study area contains approximately eight Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System permittees:
Westminster, Adams County, City and County of Broomfield, Louisville, CDOT, Boulder, Boulder County, and
Longmont. The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System permit holders convey runoff directly to state waters
and therefore are responsible for water quality and maintenance of its system under CDPHE.

The BNSF corridor utilizes existing structures to cross natural drainages, such as creeks, streams, and
manufactured drainages, such as ditches. The BNSF corridor crosses 13 natural drainages with bridges or large
concrete box culverts and 17 major ditches with concrete box culverts. Along with the open channel features
within the NWR Corridor, there are closed or storm sewer systems near the at-grade crossings and stations.
The drainage at the at-grade crossings are collected and conveyed away from the track in storm sewer
systems. Most station locations are currently within developed areas with existing drainage systems. Additional
resource-specific information regarding surface water crossings and drainage patterns is located in the Water
Resources and Water Quality section.

Groundwater

The study area has two main aquifers: the South Platte River alluvial aquifer and the Denver Basin aquifer
system. The South Platte River alluvial aquifer is associated with the major streams in the study area and
generally ranges from 20 to 100 feet below ground surface level. The Denver Basin aquifer system consists of
five separate aquifers, the Denver Aquifer, Arapahoe Aquifer, the Laramie Formation, the Laramie Fox-Hills
Aquifer, and the Boulder Complex-Area. These aquifers lie beneath the southern portion of the study area and
have depths of up to 2,000 feet. There is no main aquifer in the northwestern portion of the study area.
Regional groundwater flow is generally to the east toward the South Platte River (Colorado Division of Water
Resources, 2022). Groundwater resources in the study area are shown in Figure 71.
A total of 221 wells are mapped within the study area; of these, 80 are classified as abandoned (Colorado
Division of Water Resources, 2022). Half of the remaining wells (70) are used for domestic supply, with the
remaining 71 wells divided between other uses, such as commercial, industrial, irrigation, and monitoring wells
associated with contaminated properties throughout the study area. Well records do not indicate whether
these wells are in use.

Next Steps

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable. During NEPA, an impact assessment will focus on areas
where station locations intersect with surface and ground waters in the study area, especially those which are
303(d) listed as impaired waters for one or more items. Any temporary, construction-related impacts to
surface water and runoff will also be considered. Any changes in impervious surface area, such as the
construction of concrete parking lots or structures, will be calculated. Once design files are available,
groundwater well data will be analyzed to understand the proximity of new infrastructure and construction to
active or inactive wells within the study area.

Floodplains

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines a flood as a temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or two or more properties, at least one of
which is the policyholder's property, from an overflow of inland or tidal waters, unusual and rapid
accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, or mudflow (FEMA, 2022). FEMA defines a base
flood as a 100-year flood or flood event with a one-percent chance of occurring or being exceeded during a
given year. Special Flood Hazard Areas, Regulatory Floodplains, or locally designated floodplains that FEMA
does not map are the designated areas subject to inundation during the base flood.

Agencies Involved

The following agencies are responsible for regulating floodplains within the NWR Corridor:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

FEMA
USACE District Office, Denver Regulatory Office
Colorado Department of Natural Resources, Colorado Water Conservation Board
Mile High Flood District
Adams County, Engineering Department
City and County of Boulder, Planning and Development Department
City and County of Broomfield, Engineering Department
Jefferson County, Planning and Zoning Department
City of Arvada, Engineering Department
City of Lafayette, Planning and Building Department
City of Longmont, Public Works & Natural Resources Department
City of Louisville, Planning Department
City of Westminster, Engineering Department

Relevant Regulations, Guidance, Studies, and Plans

FEMA regulates floodplains and floodways at the federal level under the National Flood Insurance Program.
Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, established standards for designing highways. Floodplains are
regulated at the local level by floodplain ordinances of cities or counties for both FEMA and non-FEMA
floodplains.
Floodplains are also regulated at the federal level by the USDOT Order DOT 5650.2, which prescribes policies
and procedures for ensuring proper consideration to avoid and mitigate adverse floodplain impacts in agency
actions, planning programs, and budget requests.

Brief Description of Resource Studied

The Colorado Water Conservation Board Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado (CWCB,
2022) provides uniform standards for regulatory floodplains (or floodplains) in Colorado, standards for
activities that may impact regulatory floodplains, and stipulates the process by which floodplains would be
designated and approved.

Data Collection/Methodology

Finding/Results

The study area crosses Boulder, Broomfield, Jefferson, and Adams counties. Within those counties, the study
area passes through Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, Longmont, Lafayette, and Arvada. The NWR
Corridor crosses over the 100-year floodplain in approximately 17 locations and over regulated floodways in
approximately seven locations, as shown in Figure 72. Table 52 describes the number of floodplains and
regulated floodways crossings associated with each county and the corresponding sub-watershed boundary
and major waterways.

The study area for this floodplain analysis includes a 300-foot buffer from the edge of the right of way of the
BNSF corridor and a 300-foot buffer around each station. Several streams and other water features identified
within the study area were obtained from the National Wetlands Inventory, FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer,
and the USGS Watershed Boundary Data. County and other local floodplain administrator’s offices were
obtained from the county's or municipality’s website.

Next Steps

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and
environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental
and design project development steps, as applicable. Encroachment of any floodplains in the study area will be
subject to the requirements of federal and local agencies. Correspondence with local agencies and FEMA will
be required to ensure that the NWR Corridor is developed consistent with local floodway plans and floodplain
management programs. This coordination effort will be documented in subsequent documents, including
NEPA. An additional requirement is coordination with the appropriate USACE district regulatory office. A
resource specialist will need to contact the local floodplain authority early in the planning process to enable
USACE’s floodplain management concerns to be addressed and incorporated into the initial design.

Traffic Corridor Context Report

RTD is conducting the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (Study) for a 35-mile extension of the B Line
commuter rail service from the existing Westminster – 72nd Station to Boulder and Longmont. The extension
would include six new stations with infrastructure to support the commuter rail service (Downtown
Westminster, Broomfield–116th, Flatiron, Downtown Louisville, Boulder Junction at Depot Square, and
Downtown Longmont) (Figure 1). The Study will evaluate how to best provide ‘rush-hour’ service (Peak
Service) on the existing BNSF Railway (BNSF) tracks: three weekday morning trips from Longmont to Denver
and three weekday evening trips from Denver to Longmont. The Study will update capital, operations, and
maintenance costs to implement the Peak Service on the Northwest Rail Corridor (NWR Corridor) in a manner
to not preclude a future buildout.

cross the roadway network (railway crossings) along the NWR Corridor and in the areas surrounding the new
stations. The study area for the existing traffic conditions includes the six new stations, 14 existing gradeseparated crossings, 37 existing at-grade crossings, and four new sidings. For purposes of this report, Peak
Service weekday morning trips are assumed to run three times departing between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., and
three times in the afternoon departing between 4:15 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. This report provides the foundation
for a future Traffic Operations Analysis Report to be prepared as part of the Northwest Rail Peak Service
Study.

Methodology/Data Sources
Data for the existing traffic conditions was derived from online sources, including Google Maps, Google Earth,
and Replica HQ. Google Earth satellite imagery was used to identify at-grade crossings, then the crossing
locations were mapped with the most current NWR Corridor alignment.
Google Streetview images were reviewed at the at-grade crossing locations to assess the number of lanes,
crossing control arms, pedestrian crossing conditions, and lighting at the crossing. Next, the roadway
classification at the crossing was noted. Traffic volume estimates at the crossings come from Replica HQ, a big
data software that provides regional volume data similar to a travel demand model. Replica HQ simulates the
movements and trips of a ‘synthetic population’ and uses this data to predict traffic volumes over the region’s
roadway network. This study used data from Replica HQ’s fall 2019 Thursday model run, which was chosen to
represent typical weekday traffic. The volumes were used to give an approximate estimate of expected traffic
on the railway crossings.
Google Earth was used to identify the nearest signalized and unsignalized intersections in both directions from
the at-grade crossing. Locations where the tracks cross in close proximity to a signalized intersection have the
greatest potential to cause wider traffic disruptions to the surrounding network. Adjacent cross streets also
have the potential to be affected by backups caused by rail crossing activity. This work lays the foundation for
a future traffic impact analysis, where these potential impacts will be studied in more detail.

At-Grade Crossing Characteristics
Railway crossings were categorized by at-grade crossings and grade-separated crossings.

Cross Streets and Signalized Intersections
Near At-Grade Crossings
Turning movements on streets that cross the roads impacted by at-grade crossings have the potential to be
disrupted by the queue of vehicles backed up by the at-grade crossing. Existing conditions for these cross
streets near the at-grade crossings were identified because these streets have the highest potential for
disruption due to the traffic caused by the at-grade crossing. Two sets of data are listed: the nearest cross
streets of any kind in both directions from the crossing, and the two nearest signalized intersections in both
directions from the crossing. The control type and the classification of the nearest cross street are also listed.
Types of control include signalized intersections, one-way stop control (OWSC), two-way stop control (TWSC),
all-way stop control (AWSC), and yield signs. This data is summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

Traffic Corridor Context Report

Existing traffic congestion levels for the areas near at-grade crossings were approximated using Google Maps
typical traffic data for a typical weekday, in this case a Thursday, during the times the train is projected to
pass. These congestion levels have not been verified by a field visit. A field visit to the at-grade crossings
where there are higher levels of congestion is advised and could be conducted as part of the future traffic
operations analysis.
Google Maps uses a color scheme to indicate levels of traffic congestion—green represents little traffic
congestion, orange represents mild traffic congestion, red represents heavy traffic congestion, and dark red
represents extremely heavy traffic congestion. Typical traffic conditions at all at-grade crossings fell under
either green or orange conditions, suggesting little to mild traffic congestion exists currently on the typical
weekday.
Traffic conditions at the nearest cross streets to the at-grade crossings were observed using Google Maps
traffic data. Congestion at an intersection near an at-grade crossing has the potential to be indirectly worsened
by traffic conditions at the at-grade crossing and may contribute to the need for further study. The conditions
at the nearest intersections to the crossings are included in the generalized congestion levels listed for each
crossing.
Business activity can be potentially affected by traffic impacts at the crossings, and business activity can also
contribute to the congestion at the crossings. Satellite imagery and Google Street views of areas surrounding
the at-grade crossings were used to rate the level of business activity surrounding the crossings. Each crossing
was subjectively assigned a Commerce Index rating based on observed land use, ranging from 1 to 5. A rating
of 1 signifies a crossing in a low-density, rural setting with no surrounding business activity; a rating of 3
signifies a low-to-medium density of businesses served by low-volume driveways and parking lots; and a
rating of 5 signifies a dense, urban business landscape. The ratings are meant only to indicate where further
investigation may be necessary.
Table 4 lists the observed Google Maps traffic congestion levels at the at-grade crossings and the Commerce
Index ratings.

Gate closure times at the at-grade crossings impact traffic flow and congestion levels. Currently, gate closures
occur when the BNSF freight trains pass. Current gate closure times for the freight trains are uncertain
because the BNSF schedule is not readily available or routinely predictable. Estimated gate closure time for
three-car passenger trains is approximately 30 to 60 seconds. Gate closure times for freight trains are
substantially longer because the trains are significantly longer than passenger trains and travel at slower
speeds. RTD estimates that there are between eight and ten freight trains per day, and some of these trains
may operate during peak times, including the Peak Service timeframes.

It is possible that traffic impacts at the at-grade crossings would be reduced with the regularity of the
passenger train schedule and because freight trains are not planned to operate when passenger trains are

running during Peak Service times. The comparison between existing gate closure times and projected gate
closure times during the Peak Service periods will be made in future traffic operations analysis.

The approximate existing traffic volumes and congestion levels at the at-grade crossings and at nearby cross
streets and signalized intersections paints a picture of which at-grade crossings may have an impact on
surrounding roadway operations under future conditions. High-volume, congested at-grade crossings that are
close to other high-volume cross streets may see increased congestion due to increased train traffic. Other
factors that may cause traffic impacts include high speeds approaching stopped traffic, complex intersection
geometry, and low roadway storage in advance of crossings.
One factor alone will not significantly impact traffic congestion in the area surrounding the at-grade crossings
because the crossing arm closure time is relatively short for the passenger trains. It is combinations of existing
conditions that would cause potential traffic concerns at crossings. For example, a crossing being in proximity
to a nearby intersection is not enough on its own to cause significant impacts. If the volume is low at the atgrade crossing or on the cross street near the at-grade crossing, it is unlikely that there would be traffic
impacts due to a short gate closure. However, if this proximity is combined with high traffic volumes or
complex intersection geometry, then the at-grade crossing warrants further study to identify potential traffic
impacts.
Existing conditions features for the at-grade crossings were compiled to help determine what combination of
factors could potentially contribute to traffic impacts from the NWR and their relative level of concern. Concern
levels were assigned to the at-grade crossings, as follows:
•

At-grade crossings that have no concerning existing conditions were given a concern level of 0.

•

At-grade crossings that have one concerning existing factor, such as high volume or nearby cross streets,
were given a concern score of 1; these intersections are not expected to be impacted by the new Peak
Service.

•

At-grade crossings given a concern score of 2 may have combinations of factors, such as high volumes and
existing congestion, but generally have enough storage or distance from other cross streets to not
anticipate major impacts.

•

The most complex and crowded at-grade crossings that are in close proximity to other cross streets are
given a concern score of 3, and potential traffic impacts due to the Peak Service will be studied in more
depth in a traffic operations analysis.

Traffic Corridor Context Report

Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) guidelines require trains to blow locomotive horns in advance of all atgrade rail crossings for between 15 and 20 seconds. A local municipality can apply for a quiet zone, which
removes the requirement for conductors to sound the horn at the crossing. Roadway improvements at
crossings, such as quad gates, median extensions, and additional signage, are required in order for the
crossing to be eligible for a quiet zone. Municipalities along the NWR Corridor have recently made
improvements to crossings or planned projects in order for their at-grade crossings to become quiet zones.
Much of this improved crossing infrastructure is documented in previous sections in this report, as
municipalities are required to have safety features such as quad gates and medians in place before applying
for a quiet zone from the FRA. Figure 3 illustrates designated quiet zones as of October 2022.
The Northwest Rail alignment includes an approximately 19-mile stretch of continuous quiet zones between
112th Avenue in Broomfield/Westminster and 63rd Street north of Boulder. Every at-grade crossing in this part
of the alignment is designated as a quiet zone, leading to a continuous zone where no train horns are required
to be sounded.

Planned Station Areas

Study areas for the stations include the station access driveway and surrounding intersections expected to
experience traffic increases due to parking demand and Kiss-n-Ride drop-off trips. The study area defined in
this report is based on expected daily parking demand forecasts. Parking demand is one indicator of potential
trips to the stations, and trips generated by the new stations are expected to be somewhat proportional to
parking demand. In a future traffic operations analysis, the expected new trips due to the NWR station will be
distributed over intersections in the study area to determine the traffic impacts of building the new station.
Study areas will encompass larger areas at stations with higher parking demand because the demand will take
more intersections to dissipate.
The Downtown Longmont Station would experience the highest parking demand as the terminal station. The
Downtown Louisville Station is projected to have the next highest parking demand.
Alternate modes are accounted for in the parking demand forecasts, such as transit service, cyclists,
pedestrian trips, and Kiss-n-Ride drop-offs. While transit, bicycle, and pedestrian trips are expected to have
little to no impact on trip generation, Kiss-n-Ride trips would because they generate two AM and two PM trips
per rider, rather than one AM and one PM trip for those who park at the station. These Kiss-n-Ride trips will be
accounted for in trip generation estimates in addition to the parking demand projections.
More refined estimates of trip generation will be provided in a future traffic operations analysis using Peak
Service ridership estimates. The most recent parking demand estimates used to predict study area size for this
report are listed in Table 6.

Traffic Corridor Context Report

The areas surrounding all the stations currently experience mild to moderate traffic congestion on a typical
weekday during the peak periods. Existing conditions can be further quantified by peak hour turning
movement counts at key intersections. The project team has requested nearby existing turning movement
counts from the municipalities where the stations are planned. If turning movement counts are made available
at the suggested study area intersections, or at intersections near the study area, the project team will review
this data and use it to quantify existing traffic conditions. In the absence of existing counts, the project team
may order counts or use big data software, such as Replica HQ or Streetlight, to generate approximate turning
movement counts at the study area intersections as part of the future conditions analysis.

Summary
The existing BNSF corridor to be used for the NWR Peak Service has 51 roadway crossings along its
alignment—14 crossings are grade separated, and 37 are at-grade. Based on a review of the data collected,
most of the at-grade crossings have existing conditions that do not give cause for concern about traffic
impacts due to the Peak Service.
At-grade crossings that were assigned a concern level of 3 (At-Grade Crossings Potential for Concern)
generally feature a combination of factors, such as high volume, low storage, and proximity to existing
intersections, and will likely require further study in a future traffic operations analysis. These seven crossings
are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Nickel Street
Pine Street
South Boulder Road
Independence Road
Jay Road
Niwot Road
Ken Pratt Boulevard

The 11 at-grade crossings with a concern level of 2 may need to be investigated further based on the findings
of the future traffic operations analysis but are not expected to have traffic impacts as severe as those with a
concern level of 3.
The remaining at-grade crossings have a concern level of 1 or less, meaning that they are unlikely to
experience traffic impacts due to the Peak Service.

Each of the six new stations is expected to generate new roadway trips to and from the station. Exact trip
generation numbers will be refined further in the future traffic operations analysis. The intersections suggested
for further study listed in the Planned Station Areas Section are based on the existing congestion levels per
Google Maps and the forecasted parking demand. Each station access driveway will be studied in more depth,
along with nearby intersections based on congestion and expected trips.
All existing conditions in this report were derived from review of online sources, such as Google Maps, Google
Earth, and Replica HQ. Field observation of the seven crossings at concern level 3 is suggested to verify the

Transit Corridor Context Report

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is conducting the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (Study) for a
35-mile extension of the B Line commuter rail service from the existing Westminster-72nd Station to Boulder
and Longmont. The extension would include six new stations with infrastructure to support the commuter rail
service (Downtown Westminster, Broomfield – 116th, Flatiron, Downtown Louisville, Boulder Junction at Depot
Square, and Downtown Longmont; Figure 1). The Study will evaluate how to best provide ‘rush-hour’ service
(Peak Service) on the existing BNSF Railway (BNSF) tracks: three weekday morning trips from Longmont to
Denver and three weekday evening trips from Denver to Longmont. The Study will update capital, operations,
and maintenance costs to implement the Peak Service on the Northwest Rail (NWR) Corridor in a manner to
not preclude a future buildout configuration, which is future expansion of service beyond peak service.
It is reasonable to expect that transit services in RTD’s northwest service area (northwest area) will see
increased travel demands—RTD provides that “by 2050 population in the Denver area is expected to grow by
approximately 31%, resulting in increased congestion and an even greater need for transportation
options.”1 Furthermore, the Regional Bus Rapid Transit Feasibility study states that transit demand within the
region could double by 2040.2 In a region that is experiencing rapid and significant population and economic
growth, the worsening effects of climate change, along with federal and local governmental policy decisions
that are driving programs to seek environmentally conscious decisions, promotion of transit will continue to be
an increasing priority.
Even with increased traffic congestion and worsening environmental conditions, travel demands are not
decreasing. RTD’s Quality of Life State of the System report states that in 2018, 21% of lane miles on major
roadways in the Denver metropolitan area (1,489 miles) were congested for three or more hours on an
average weekday. A typical vehicle spent 16% of its travel time in delayed conditions, and in 2019, there were
over 77 million vehicle hours of delay.3 Transit investments such as Northwest Rail provide options for
travelers and reduce trips along the roadway system.
This report outlines the past, current, and future conditions of transit service surrounding the six proposed
NWR stations and how current and future transit conditions would interact with the NWR Peak Service.

Transit Corridor Context Report
Northwest Rail Background

This phased approach has been used successfully in other major urban regions, particularly in the western
United States over the past 40 years. Examples include Salt Lake City, Utah, with the Front Runner; Dallas/Fort
Worth, Texas, with the Trinity Railway Expressway; San Diego, California, with the Coaster; and
Everette/Seattle/Tacoma, Washington, with the Sounder. These services are examples of commuter rail that
started with limited service and funding and then were expanded as ridership and funding grew. The NWR can
be implemented with a phased approach similar to the cities mentioned, growing and adjusting as service
demand changes, presumably increasing.

Existing Transit Services
Overview of Transit Network
Regionally, the greater Longmont, Boulder, and Denver areas have an extensive transit system (Figure 2). The
areas along the NWR Corridor have experienced significant growth in the last decade, which is predicted to
continue. The area also sees high levels of people commuting by car as people drive to work and home along
US 36 and I-25, which contributes to undesirable traffic congestion in peak commuting times. With increased
population and travel demand in the region, one of RTD’s FasTracks program goals is to balance transit needs
with regional growth.4

In recent years, RTD has been coordinating with BNSF to develop an operating plan for passenger rail service
on the NWR Corridor, while maintaining BNSF’s flexibility to continue to operate freight service. A NWR
operating plan that focuses on peak commuting times may offer opportunities for passenger rail service that
can be implemented in the near term and expanded over time as ridership grows and additional capital and
operating funds are secured.

Transit Corridor Context Report

The following sections outline the existing transit services and routes in the northwest area that would support
the Northwest Rail Peak Service.

Regional Express Routes

The regional bus routes that parallel the NWR Corridor that can be considered comparable or competing
services are described below. The stations highlighted in red in the tables below indicate that the station either
directly connects to a NWR station or would provide potential transfer possibilities through a variety of modes.

Flatiron Flyer6

The RTD Flatiron Flyer (FF) is one of the most successful bus services in terms of regional connectivity and
ridership in the northwest area and connects Boulder to Denver. The family of routes (Table 1) are in
proximity to the NWR Corridor and could allow for connectivity via local service or other modes to several of
the NWR stations (Downtown Westminster, Broomfield – 116th, and the existing Boulder Junction at Depot
Square bus station). The Flatiron Flyer runs seven routes; however, four of those routes are currently
suspended due to COVID with plans to restore some service in the immediate future, as will be outlined in
later sections. The three routes currently in service are:


FF1. Runs all stations all day every 15 minutes at peak periods and every 30 minutes at non-peak periods.
FF1 also operates on Saturdays every 15 minutes mid-day, and on Sundays/Holidays every 30 minutes
midday.



FF5. Runs from Downtown Boulder Station to Anschutz at a.m. and p.m. peak periods.



FF3. Suspended except for some limited Sunday and weekend service.

The FF currently serves three stations in close proximity to the NWR Corridor, the US 36 & Broomfield station
which is within a half mile of the Broomfield – 116th, the US 36 & Sheridan station within a half mile of
Downtown Westminster Station, and US 36 & Flatiron Station, which would serve as the Flatiron Station for
NWR.

First- and last-mile connections provide important links to transit. Electronic bikes and scooters have helped fill
first- and last-mile gaps, and these services are expected to expand in the service area and the metropolitan
Denver area. In addition, many communities along the NWR Corridor have FlexRide, which is a first- and lastmile RTD service that provides connections between RTD stations, medical centers, and business parks and is
available on a first-come-first-served basis within specific FlexRide Zones.

Commuter Rail Routes

The existing geographically relevant commuter rail network includes the RTD N Line and the RTD B Line. The
B Line currently runs from Denver to South Westminster and would extend north as the NWR.

B Line

The B Line is the existing portion of the proposed NWR line and runs every hour with stops at Union Station,
41st & Fox Station, Pecos Junction Station, and Westminster-72nd Station both during the week and on
weekends. The first portion of this line, which is the first portion of the NWR, opened in July of 2016 and is
currently 5.7 miles long and serves the four stops listed above. In 2019, annual ridership on the B Line was
477,2868.

The N Line provides regional north-south connectivity. Currently, this line runs every 30 minutes both on
weekdays and weekends all day with stops at Union Station, 48th & Brighton at NWC, Commerce City & 72nd,
Original Thornton & 88th, Thornton Crossroads & 104th, Northglenn & 112th, and Eastlake & 124th. This is
RTD’s most recent commuter rail addition. The N Line opened in September of 2020 and is 13 miles long. The
N Line utilizes electric commuter rail technology and connects Denver to Commerce City and Thornton. In
2021, this line had an annual ridership of 763,000, a 339.2% increase/change in ridership from 2020, which is
the year it first opened.9

Existing Bus Service to Proposed NWR Stations/Connecting and Surrounding
Routes and Service
This section outlines the routes that connect to each of the proposed NWR stations as well as the peak
headways for each route. Only peak headways are described here because the NWR in its initial stages would
run during peak periods.

Downtown Westminster Station

The Downtown Westminster Station is currently relatively well connected to transit, as there are six routes that
service stops that are within a quarter mile of the Downtown Westminster Station. The routes near the
Downtown Westminster Station are shown in Figure 3 and Table 5.

Downtown Longmont Station
Similar to the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station, the land use surrounding Downtown Longmont
Station is relatively dense with several established existing stops and routes. The proposed station in
Longmont planned for Northwest Rail is called “Longmont Station” in accordance with past planning efforts. In
more recent planning efforts, this station has been renamed “1st and Main Station”. However, in this report
and other Northwest Rail Peak Service Study documents, the station name “Downtown Longmont” will be
retained.
Longmont is also served by RTD’s FlexRide service, which provides on-demand transit service to customers
within a 48-square-mile zone.10 Route 324 does not officially go into the Longmont Park-n-Ride, and instead
uses the on-street stop at Main & Jersey. The routes near the 1st & Main Station are shown in Figure 8 and

Ridership & Service Pre- & Post-COVID-19
Ridership Changes
Transit ridership for RTD was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, pre-pandemic, RTD saw an
annual total system transit ridership that was 105,824,000.11 On April 19, 2020, service hours for all of RTD’s
services were reduced by approximately 40%, which was a result of a significant decline across all service
types due to stay at home orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a total annual transit
system ridership of 52,617,000 in 2020.12 RTD saw a negative 56% change in total annual light rail ridership
from 2019 to 2020 and a negative 48% change in annual commuter rail ridership from 2019 to 2020.13
In 2022, ridership demonstrated signs of recovery. RTD reports that the ridership between 2021 (January to
June) and 2022 (January to June) in all revenue service (Bus, Access-a-Ride, Light Rail, and Commuter Rail)
rose by 39%. The Flatiron Flyer alone saw a positive 62% change in this same date range and combined
commuter rail services saw a positive 40% change. This suggests a return to higher ridership for RTD services
is likely and increase in demand for more regional connectivity could be expected.14
This section provides an overview of COVID-19 impacts on the RTD system overall and the northwest area
specifically.

COVID-19 Impacts to the RTD System

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

8th & Coffman Park-n-Ride

RTD reports that in January of 2022 there were 518,000 monthly commuter rail boardings and in June of
2022, commuter rail had 728,000 monthly boardings. There were 3,016,000 monthly boardings for bus service
in June 2022 and 2,540,000 monthly boardings in January 2022, as seen in Figure 9 and Figure 10. This
analysis shows a slight increase in both rail and bus ridership just within the first six months of 2022, which is
approximately the period when City and County of Denver lowered many of the mandates that had been in

Ridership Changes in Northwest Area

Like many of the transit services in the region, the Flatiron Flyer saw a large decline in service hours and
routes. As mentioned previously, four of the seven routes have been suspended. In 2019, pre-pandemic, the
Flatiron Flyer had a total ridership of over 3 million, whereas in 2020 ridership was only just over 1 million.16 In
2021, Flatiron Flyer annual ridership was 817,000,17 and between January and June of 2021 it was 304,000.18
Between January and June 2022, ridership on the Flatiron Flyer was 492,000, a 62% increase from 2021 in the
same period.19
In its first year of service, pre-pandemic, the N Line was projected to carry over 2 million riders annually. In
2021, ridership was only 763,000 riders annually.20 However, in the first half of 2022, ridership has increased.
In 2021 and 2022, between January and June, the N Line had a ridership of 294,000 and 447,000 respectively,
a 52% increase year over year from 2021 to 2022.21
In January of 2022, Flatiron Flyer had 63,000 monthly boardings, which was a 55% increase from 2021. The N
Line had 62,000 monthly boardings, and the B Line had 10,000 monthly boardings in January of 2022.
According to the RTD Regional Bus Rapid Transit Feasibility Study22, the Flatiron Flyer had the second most
annual boardings, surpassed only by transit on the East Colfax corridor.23

Future Conditions
Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan

A key feature of the SOP is the categorization of routes into a new travel market-based network of services.
The new service categories are as follows:


Core routes. Regional routes serving prominent employment centers, high density housing, that are major
trip generators with a demonstrated demand for frequent and extensive service hours; Routes 0 and 15
are examples of Core Routes.



Connect routes. Local bus routes with a minimum 14-hour span of service (6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.), such
as Route 100.



Commute routes. Regional routes with limited stops serving unique travel markets (SkyRide and Route LD
are examples).



Community routes. Community-focused local routes with custom-built span of service, frequency, and
days of service to meet local needs. Examples of community routes are local routes, on-demand services,
and other services, such as the 16th Street Mall Ride.

RTD’s SOP network is shown in Figure 11.

The existing US 36 & Flatiron Station and the NWR Flatiron Station would be generally service the same area.
Service improvements stated in the SOP to restore the FF4 would directly enhance service to the Flatiron
Station and provide connection to NWR. The improvements to Route AB, as indicated in the SOP, include
restoring Route AB2’s service to and from the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station and suggests headway
operating times to be 60 minutes in the peak periods all days of the week. Between both Routes AB1 and AB2
patterns, the Route AB from the existing Downtown Boulder Station would operate every 30 minutes allday and would serve the US 36 & Flatiron Station. Improved service of Route 228 would also provide positive
benefits to the Flatiron Station, including increased frequency to 30 minutes and better connections.

The SOP outlines service improvements for Routes 324 and BOLT (future CO 119 BRT) which both would
provide a connection near the Downtown Longmont Station. The current LD routes will remain in service with
rail operations in place as the LD serves a separate ridership shed and purpose than the proposed NWR. The
LD provides connectivity between Longmont, Erie, Lafayette, and Broomfield while NWR connects Longmont,
Boulder, Louisville, Broomfield, Westminster/Arvada, and Denver. The LD routes are slated to become the
future US 287 BRT, as is indicated by the SOP. The CO 119 BRT will operate at 15-minute headways during
peak weekday service hours and 30-minute headways on the weekends.
As part of the Longmont ‘Fare-Buy-Up’ program, Routes 324 and 323 are being bought up and will be paid for
by the City of Longmont and will be included in the “Ride Free Longmont” program. This has increased
boardings as stated in the North Team Service Analysis & State Highway 119 BRT Feeder Plan; however, it is
unclear if this service will remain once CO 119 BRT is in place. Furthermore, the ‘Fare-Buy-Up' program is
reviewed on a bi-annual basis without guarantee to continue, based on funds available from the City of
Longmont as well as outcomes of the fare study. It will remain in place as long as the city has adequate funds
to pay for it; it is anticipated that there will be adequate funds, especially with the implementation of CO 119
BRT service.

Route

The North Team Service Analysis & State Highway 119 BRT Feeder Plan suggests splitting the existing 323
route into two distinct services to establish a more grid-like network in Longmont. The northern route would

operate 30-minute peak headways and 60-minute non-peak headways while the southern route would operate
30-minute headways all day and would operate on Sundays whereas the northern route would not. Both the
north and south routes would access the Downtown Longmont Station. This plan also suggests that Route 324
would be split near the Downtown Longmont Station into a north and south segment as well.

BRT is a growing service within the region and can be categorized into two main types. The RTD Regional Bus
Rapid Transit Study26 describes how BRT service is categorized according to the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA). These two categories are corridor-based BRT and fixed guideway BRT, the latter of which is preferred
by RTD because it has higher potential for travel time savings.
The RTD Regional Bus Rapid Transit Feasibility Study also outlines the minimum service frequency for Local,
Regional to Central Business District, Rail and Enhanced Bus, and SkyRide, as shown in Figure 12.

The northwest area has been experiencing rapid growth, in terms of population, economy, and infrastructure.
There are several commuter rail and BRT projects that are proposed and planned. The municipalities along the
corridor have published several plans, many of which include assumptions about future development as it
relates to the Northwest Rail.

This section outlines key BRT and commuter rail projects that are being planned. The North Area Mobility
Study (NAMS) report outlines several key BRT corridors including routes along CO 119, US 287, 120th Avenue,
South Boulder Road, CO 7, and CO 42.

Of the BRT routes proposed in the NAMS report, the CO 119 corridor is most relevant to the NWR Downtown
Longmont Station. The North Team Service Analysis & State Highway 119 BRT Feeder Plan 27 identified four
options for this service, of which Option B is RTD’s preferred option. Under Option B, CO 119 corridor would
have two routes as shown in Figure 13—Blue and Orange—both of which would stop at the Downtown
Longmont Station.

The CO 119 Safety and Mobility Improvements Project is a joint project between CDOT and RTD. The project
entails operational improvements, signing and striping, geometric improvements at intersections, and BRT
improvements. The preliminary design for this project began in late 2021. Final design began in mid-2022. The
project is projected to be completed in mid-2023.28 In its full implementation, the CO 119 Blue Route will run
15 minutes all day (weekday) in both directions and 15-to-30-minute (weekend) service in both directions,
whereas the Orange Route will run at 30-minute frequencies all day during the week with no weekend service.

Transit Corridor Context Report

The Boulder County Transportation Master Plan32 outlines the importance of BRT in providing regional transit
service and connectivity and the role it plays in connecting people to other bus services and to future rail
services.
Both the CO 119 and US 287 BRT services would support the feeder system connecting to future rail stations.

The CO 119 BRT corridor would also provide connection to the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station via
the Orange Route.

Downtown Louisville Station

The CO 42 BRT corridor would provide connection between Louisville and Broomfield. This route would start
at roughly Arapahoe (CO 7) and US 287 where it would use Arapahoe/SH7 and then head south on CO 42,
connecting to major destinations in the areas and terminate at US 36 & Broomfield Station.”33 The route would
be approximately 13 miles long, serve 27 stations, and would take 38 minutes from the US 287 & Arapahoe
Station to the US 36 & Broomfield Station. The NAMS report estimates that daily boardings incorporating
exclusive lanes for CO 42 in 2035 would be 900 for both BRT and local services.34
The NAMS report also outlines plans for BRT along S. Boulder Road, which would provide possible
connection and transfer opportunities to the NWR at the Downtown Louisville Station.

Flatiron Station

The SH 42 BRT corridor could provide connection to the Flatiron Station and allow connections to US 36
services and Routes AB, FF, and 228.

Broomfield – 116th Station

As stated earlier, the US 287 BRT corridor could connect to the US 36 & Broomfield Station which is in
proximity of the Broomfield – 116th Station, providing opportunity for transfers and for greater access to the
NWR service.
The SH 42 corridor’s southernmost station could connect to the US 36 & Broomfield Station on the east side
of US 36, opening up possible future connection to the Broomfield – 116th Station.
The 120th Avenue BRT corridor would connect to the US 36 & Broomfield Station, similarly opening up a
possible future connection to between the US 36 & Broomfield and Broomfield – 116th Stations.

Transit Corridor Context Report

The Arapahoe Road/CO 7 BRT corridor, being developed by Boulder County and its partners, does not
connect to a NWR station. It is documented here to provide a complete understanding of concurrent transit
planning in the region. The proposed route would be over 17 miles long providing a key east-west connection
and a connection to the I-25 corridor, as well as connect to City of Brighton on the east and Downtown
Boulder Station to the west. Depending on the operating scenario, BRT ridership forecasts vary from 8,5009,800 daily boardings with a dedicated lane (bus on shoulder) and from 6,400 to 7,350 daily boardings in

Conclusions & Recommendations
Efforts are underway to improve transit service in the northwest area. Boulder County is working to fill gaps in
transit service and restore transit service using American Rescue Planning Act funds and other on demand
services such as FreeRide Lafyette are being utilized to provide greater local and regional connectivity filling
gaps where fixed route service is unavailable or unfeasible.
The following outlines the recommendations for connecting existing and planned bus routes to each of the six
NWR stations.

Downtown Westminster Station
Routes 92 and 100 would service the Downtown Westminster Station. Recommendations include providing
bicycle and pedestrian access to the station, as well as bike storage, to encourage people to bike, roll, or walk
to the station instead of driving. The City of Westminster has already begun the construction of a tunnel and
bike path extension to the park-n-ride. Emphasis should be put on multimodal connections between US 36 &
Sheridan and Gold Strike Stations. Future recommendations could include branching Route 53, which will be
flipped with the current Route 51, to serve the Downtown Westminster Station.

Other BRT Corridors Planned in Region

Broomfield – 116th Station
Focus should be given to providing safe and comfortable bike and pedestrian facilities to this station
connecting the Broomfield – 116th Station to the US 36 & Broomfield Station and the US 36 Bikeway.
Consideration should also be given to providing a fixed route on-demand service during peak periods to
connect from the transit station to the rail station. It is not feasible to divert Routes 112 and 120. Both routes

provide key connections, and diverting them would result in degraded service. Future consideration should be
given to looking to Broomfield FlexRide to provide direct access to the Broomfield – 116th Station.

No recommendations are proposed for service to this station, as it is already well served by surrounding bus
routes as well as the RTD FlexRide service, which is a first-come-first-served on-demand door-to-door bus
service providing first-and last-mile connections and access to RTD stations, medical centers, and business
parks. Other considerations for this station include the addition of a High-Intensity Activated Crosswalk Beacon
(HAWK) signal, as there is a high traffic volume on Via Vara, which makes it an undesirable and unsafe
crossing for bicyclists and pedestrians.

Downtown Louisville Station
Route 228 will have future increased frequency on weekdays and should not be diverted from its future route
to directly serve the Downtown Louisville Station. The Downtown Louisville Station should be given high bike
and pedestrian access priority. The DASH cannot be feasibly diverted to directly serve the Downtown Louisville
Station, as Front Street is not wide enough to accommodate transit vehicles and thus transit cannot directly
access the station. However, the DASH has two stops (Main St & Spruce St and Main St & Short) in proximity
to the Downtown Louisville Station within a quarter mile. Focus should be given to improving bike and
pedestrian facilities and looking to FlexRide to provide first- and last-mile connections when multimodal
transportation is not possible between the existing DASH stops and the Downtown Louisville Station.

Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station
The City of Boulder could divert the HOP to serve the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station. Diverting the
208 to the Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station has been deemed undesirable as it would take service
away from low-income areas. Consideration could be given to branching Route 208 in the future; however,
this would require finding an on-street/layover option for the routing of this bus service. Routes JUMP and
DASH cannot be rerouted either, as both would require an entirely new routing and would change service to
those routes.

Downtown Longmont Station
As noted earlier in the report, The proposed station in Longmont planned for Northwest Rail is called
“Longmont Station” in accordance with past planning efforts. In more recent planning efforts, this station has
been renamed “1st and Main Station”. However, in this report and other Northwest Rail Peak Service Study
documents, the station name “Downtown Longmont” will be retained.

Attachment: MS-2 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Flatiron Station

The CO 119 BRT will directly serve the Downtown Longmont Station. The CO 119 BRT and Route LD will
access the station via Coffman Bus Way, between 9th Ave and 1st Ave along Coffman. Route LX may have a
few trips that provide access to the Downtown Longmont Station. The North Team Service Analysis & State
Highway 119 BRT Feeder Plan36 also identifies Route 328 as a new route in Longmont, which will serve the
Downtown Longmont Station. This plan also proposes Route 329, which would stop at the Downtown
Longmont. It also proposes to split Routes 323 and 324 into northern and southern routes which would access

The existing BNSF Corridor through the Westminster Section is surrounded by residences in the south (Photo
A1), which transitions to open space and larger lot residential developments in the north. Near the Downtown
Westminster Station at 88th and Harlan Street, residential and commercial uses dominate the foreground
(Photo A2). Background views of the Rocky Mountains are available to westbound travelers along 88th
Avenue, and large trees, cottonwoods, pines, and spruce line both sides of the roadway near the station area
(Photo A3). Views of the Rocky Mountains and natural landscapes, for example Big Dry Creek, are generally
fragmented by commercial and residential developments (Photo A4).
Viewers in this area include residents, workers/neighbors, visitors, and commuters/travelers along 88th
Avenue. These viewers have low sensitivity to views as the area is highly developed, with natural features only
visible in the background. Some views of the mountains remain, especially from 88th Avenue, as depicted in

Throughout the Broomfield Section, views of the Rocky Mountains are interrupted by recently constructed
residential developments. Land use at the Broomfield Station near West 116th Avenue and Main Street is
discontinuous with various visual characteristics, including commercial, residential, industrial, agricultural, and
vacant lots (Photo B1). To the west of the existing BNSF Corridor are low-density residential areas, several
small offices, US 36, and a small agricultural lot. US 36 dominates the foreground in this area (Photo B2).
Directly adjacent to the railway are large high-density apartment complexes currently under construction
(Photo B3). Large industrial facilities dominate the area east of the railway. The Broomfield Industrial Park is
located southeast of the station. This facility includes several baseball fields owned and managed by
Broomfield Parks and Trails. While there are various land use types, the foreground and midground views
indicate a typical mixed-use area.
The station at Flatiron Crossing has been partially constructed with the US 36 & Flatiron Station Westside Parkn-Ride (Photo B4). Most of the surrounding land use visible in the foreground is commercial (west of the
station) and undeveloped or open space (east of the station). US 36 separates the station from the Flatiron
Marketplace, with several commercial businesses. Views to the west include the Flatiron Crossing Mall in the
middle ground and the Flatirons of the Rocky Mountains in the background. Views to the east are primarily
open space, comprised of rolling hills with sparse vegetation typical of Front Range prairie landscapes.
Viewers in this area include residents, workers/neighbors, recreationists, and commuters/travelers who have a
lower sensitivity to views in areas dominated by light industrial, commercial, and higher-density residential
land uses. Neighbors and recreationists are moderately sensitive to foreground views, including open space.
Transit-oriented development associated with the Flatiron Station affords limited open space views and the
Rocky Mountains in the background.

The Louisville Section provides a variety of landforms, providing views of small-scale historic and cultural
resources in the foreground and natural landscapes in the background. The Corridor passes through
undeveloped lands and open space, with several sweeping, unobstructed views of the Rocky Mountains (Photo
C1). The Downtown Louisville Station is located adjacent to historic downtown Louisville and newly
constructed commercial development and high-density residential complexes that span the existing railway
(Photos C2 and C3). Historic downtown Louisville is located west of the existing rail line and exhibits a mixture
of recreation, commercial, and medium-density single-family residential uses. Walking paths, shops,
restaurants, historic homes, a public library, and a pavilion for outdoor entertainment line Front Street and are
clearly visible in the foreground. The South Street Pedestrian Gateway, constructed in 2017, travels
underneath the existing tracks, connecting these two distinct areas. Other nearby features include recreation
areas and large lots of agricultural land to the east (Photo C4).
Viewers in this area include residents, workers/neighbors, and recreationists on both sides of the BNSF
railway, as well as visitors to the downtown Louisville area. Viewers in this area are moderately sensitive with
views of the harmonious downtown character and historic district as well as the views of unique natural
features.

D. Boulder Section
The Corridor passes through both urban and rural settings in the Boulder Section. The easternmost and
northernmost portions of the Boulder Section, which are also the most rural, provide sweeping views in the
middle ground and background of the Flatirons and the greater Rocky Mountains (Photos D1 and D2). Within
urbanized Boulder and Boulder County, views of the Flatirons are less dominant and blend with the more
developed surrounding natural landscapes.
The station near Foothills Parkway and Valmont Road is predominantly surrounded by high-density residential,
commercial, and industrial land uses. To the west of the existing BNSF corridor is a recently constructed highdensity residential and commercial complex known as Transit Village (Photos D3 and D4). Directly adjacent to
the rail tracks are large office complexes. A narrow multi-use pedestrian and cycling path runs between the
buildings and the tracks. To the east of the tracks are large industrial buildings. The lack of vegetation or
natural elements amplifies the foreground's high-density residential and industrial use and character.

Unobstructed views of the Rocky Mountains

Viewers, including workers/neighbors, residents, visitors, commuters/travelers, and recreationists in urbanized
areas, have low sensitivity as background views of the mountains or other natural features are limited by the
high-density residential and industrial development within the area. In the less developed areas between
stations, viewer sensitivity is high as views of the open space and Flatirons remain intact.

The Corridor passes through sparsely developed land between Boulder and Longmont along SH 119, where
views of the agricultural lands and the Rocky Mountains are intact (Photos E1 and E2). Within Longmont,
where larger-scale developments are present, foreground and middle ground views are limited (Photo E3).
The Downtown Longmont Station is located at First Street and Main Street and is surrounded by a mix of
industrial, commercial, residential, transportation, and utility land uses. Directly adjacent to the station are
several small businesses. West of the station is Longmont’s utility plant. Views west include fragmented views
of the Rocky Mountains in the background, which vary in quality based on viewer location and are partially
obstructed by the Price Road Bridge structure (Photo E4).

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report

Regional Transportation District (RTD) is conducting the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (Study) for a 39mile extension of the B Line commuter rail service from the existing Westminster – 72nd Station to Boulder
and Longmont. The extension would include six new stations with infrastructure to support the commuter rail
service: Downtown Westminster, Broomfield – 116th, Flatiron, Downtown Louisville, Boulder Junction at Depot
Square, and Downtown Longmont (Figure 1). The Study will evaluate how to implement the Peak Service
Concept on the existing BNSF Railway (BNSF) tracks: three weekday morning trips from Longmont to Denver
and three weekday evening trips from Denver to Longmont.

Introduction

B.1.e

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report

Purpose of Study
The purpose of the Study is to identify the necessary infrastructure requirements, operational considerations,
and costs to enable peak period commuter rail service between Denver, Boulder, and Longmont within the
BNSF freight corridor. The peak period service must be planned to consider the potential full build-out of
infrastructure that would allow for all-day commuter rail service as presented in the FasTracks Plan, envisioned
in the 2010 Environmental Evaluation and the 2014 Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). While not part of
this Study, consideration for potential intercity rail was also considered.
The Study is being conducted to provide the technical information, informed through public and stakeholder
input, for the RTD Board of Directors to determine the feasibility of implementing peak rail service in the
corridor. The Study closely follows the traditional steps for transit infrastructure project development but is
designed to produce a Common Set of Facts that serves as a decision-making tool for the next steps of the
project. The methods and processes followed in the Study are consistent with the requirements of federal and
state requirements, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) policies and procedures, and RTD FasTracks alternatives
analysis and environmental evaluation guidelines embodied in the FasTracks Environmental Resource Guidance
and the Environmental Methodology Manual.
Although RTD has previously evaluated rail service for the Northwest corridor in prior studies, the current
Study is unique in that it is being planned concurrently with a separate study for intercity passenger rail along
the Front Range of Colorado. CDOT is preparing a Service Development Plan as required by the FRA to outline
the requirements for a passenger service between Fort Collins through Denver and Colorado Springs to
Pueblo, including the proposed alignment on the BNSF railway tracks between Longmont and Denver Union
Station (DUS) alongside the Peak Service Concept. The Study Team worked closely with CDOT and the Front
Range Passenger Rail District (FRPRD) to ensure that the two projects are complementary.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The Milestone 3 Base Configuration Confirmation Report identifies the minimum requirements (Base
Configuration) for infrastructure, operations, and maintenance to implement the Peak Service Concept on the
Northwest Rail (NWR) Corridor. The Base Configuration and the costs to build, operate, and maintain the
Peak Service Concept are critical components of the Common Set of Facts that will serve as the decisionmaking basis for future implementation of the study. Preliminary design completed by BNSF is also
incorporated into the Base Configuration. Costs to implement the Base Configuration are provided in the
Milestone 5 Report.

Peak Service Concept Definition
Peak Service Concept
The Peak Service Concept for the NWR Corridor consists of three southbound peak period trains in the
morning and three northbound peak period trains in the afternoon each weekday. The morning trains will run
from the NWR Rail Maintenance Facility (RMF) near Downtown Longmont to DUS, replacing the B Line service

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report

Alignment
The NWR corridor spans from DUS to Downtown Longmont within the existing BNSF right of way, an
alignment that has remained consistent and supported since the release of the NWR Corridor EE in 2010. The
alignment would utilize the existing BNSF freight rail track along this corridor but require the construction of
three new freight rail sidings, or double tracking, to support freight and commuter rail operations on the same
track. The corridor would continue from Downtown Longmont on BNSF and Great Western (Omnitrax) tracks
to the NWR RMF in non-revenue service.

Stations
RTD identified six new stations between Westminster – 72nd and Downtown Longmont to support an initial
peak service proposal that arose from the 2014 NAMS study. RTD developed a 2030 ridership forecast in 2017
for a service very similar in concept to the Peak Service Concept evaluated in this Study, and this Study refined
the ridership forecast to 2045 using 2019 data. This section provides a high-level summary of the proposed
stations and development conditions near the stations. Figure 1 (Introduction) shows the locations of the
stations. Appendix A provides additional information about the platform area, bus facilities, bicycle and
pedestrian access, surrounding development, and the potential for TOD.

Common Station Elements

The Peak Service Concept is unique, in comparison to other RTD commuter rail lines in that it would operate
on the tracks of an operating freight railroad. While many of the station components would be similar, such as
shelters and station furniture, ticket vending machines, and station access infrastructure and connections, one
major point of difference involves level platform boarding from freight rail tracks. RTD also evaluated other
components, such as the sizes and types of Park-N-Ride lots that would be significantly smaller for the Peak
Service Concept than those at other commuter rail stations.

Stations Served

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

for those runs into and out of DUS operated by Denver Transit Operators (DTO). Due to train storage issues at
DUS, trains operating peak service would return in revenue service to an expanded train storage location near
the existing Westminster – 72nd Station where they would be stored during the day until they returned to
service for the afternoon peak. Similarly, the afternoon trains would replace the B Line service run from
Westminster – 72nd Station to Union Station and then return to the RMF in revenue service to Longmont.
Once the trains return to the RMF site, the trains will be serviced, cleaned, and staged for use for the next
weekday.

The Peak Service Concept includes service to ten stations, including four existing stations on the B Line
(Westminster – 72nd, Pecos Junction, 41st & Fox, and the B Line Track 8 at DUS) and six new stations on the
Northwest Rail extension (Downtown Longmont, Boulder Junction at Depot Square, Downtown Louisville,
Flatiron, Broomfield – 116th, and Downtown Westminster). The four existing stations on the B Line have high
platforms with level boarding, requiring that the six new rail stations also be constructed with high platforms
since ADA accessibility cannot feasibly be maintained on a corridor with mixed platform heights. New stations
would be located on station siding tracks to meet BNSF freight clearance requirements.

B.1.e

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
The Base Configuration concept includes level platform boarding with high-floor railcars and high-platform
boarding at all stations, similar to the arrangement in Figure 2. Level boarding refers to a level interface
between the boarding platform and the train interior with no steps. Level boarding maximizes equity of access
for customers of all abilities and ensures a maximum level of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) requirements for commuter rail stations and vehicles (Federal Transit Administration Standard
Operating Practice 35, or FTA SOP-35). This interface type means wheelchairs, walkers, strollers, luggage, and
bicycles can all roll directly onto the vehicle without lifting or ramps. Level boarding has been shown to
decrease boarding, de-boarding, and dwell times at each station. Level boarding is the RTD standard for
commuter rail stations across the system. In identifying high-floor railcars and high platforms as the
recommended option for the Northwest Rail line, RTD evaluated multiple options, including high platforms, low
platforms, and mixed platform heights.

Figure 2. High-floor vehicle and high-platform boarding with ADA-compliant level
boarding at all side doors

BNSF’s freight main line track clearance requirements mean high platforms cannot be built on the main line
BNSF track. Inline station sidings would be constructed for the platforms at the six new stations to comply with
this requirement. Constructing inline station sidings at the stations to facilitate high-platform level boarding
does add cost to the Base Configuration of NWR Peak Service. However, it was determined to be the best
option from a long-term perspective. It aligns with RTD’s Community Value priority with initial investments
toward long-term double-tracking of the corridor, supports a greater range of commuter rail vehicles that can
operate on the corridor, simplifies operations, and provides the best accessibility to trains for persons with
disabilities, a key Customer Excellence priority.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
The existing Westminster Station, referred to in this Study as Westminster – 72nd Station is the end-of-line
station for the B Line, and a train storage area for EMUs operating on the B Line is located just north of the
station. To provide continuous service, a track connection would be constructed to link the existing RTD
electrified segment to the BNSF freight track. One of the two existing EMU storage tracks would be utilized for
this connection, and the train storage area would be expanded to provide storage for both EMUs operating B
Line service and NWR trains during the midday period.

New Stations

Six new stations would be built as part of the Peak Service Concept.

Downtown Westminster Station

This station area is located in Westminster, north of the BNSF trackway, south of 88th Avenue, and bordered
by Arvada to the south. The station would connect to the new downtown Westminster development, where an
increase in residents and employees is expected as redevelopment of the site progresses. Much of the parking
area in the NWR Corridor EE is now developed. The Base Configuration concept for this station is to acquire
land located south of 88th Avenue at the station site. A connection to the Discovery Trail south of the
proposed station in Arvada’s Far Horizons neighborhood is proposed along the BNSF right-of-way to make an
at-grade pedestrian crossing at 88th Avenue, while security fencing would be installed along the trail extension
to unsafe and illegal pedestrian crossings over railroad tracks. The new station would serve the downtown
Westminster area, which is expected to have over two million square feet of office space; 750,000 square feet
of retail, entertainment, and dining; 2,300 residential apartments, condominiums, and townhomes; and 300
hotel rooms. Buses would stop along 88th Avenue, a short distance from the proposed platform location.

This station area is located in Broomfield on both sides of the BNSF trackway, approximately 600 feet north
and south of 116th Avenue. The Broomfield – 116th Station is located approximately 0.25 miles east of the US
36 & Broomfield Station. The area has seen considerable recent development, with more forecasted in the
coming years. The area between US 36 and the BNSF track will likely see the most residential development as
east of the rail line comprises baseball fields and light industrial/warehousing. An important consideration is
connecting west to the existing US 36 & Flatiron BRT station and the adjacent Arista/1STBANK Center
development. An east-west connection under the railroad would also expand bicycle and pedestrian
opportunities. Some parking would likely be located on both sides of the rail line, with the potential for a
platted cul-de-sac adjacent to the new apartment complex west of the rail line, potentially allowing for a bus
turnaround. Figures 5 and 6 show the station area and concept plans, respectively.

Flatiron Station

This station area is located in the City and County of Broomfield, west of West Midway Boulevard,
approximately between West Flatiron Crossing Drive and Via Varra. This station is partially constructed with
the US 36 & Flatiron Station and Park-n-Ride already serving Flatiron Flyer BRT routes. There is Boulder
County open space north of US 36 in this area, with development potential within the limits of the City and
County of Broomfield. To the south of US 36, redevelopment of the Flatiron Crossing commercial district is
underway, with several new multi-family projects in process or planned.
As services are restored consistent with the RTD System Optimization Plan (SOP), this station would likely
require additional parking, as this station is served by Route AB with service to Denver International Airport, as
well as frequent service on the Flatiron Flyer. RTD owns parcels east and west of the existing Park-n-Ride on
the north side of US 36. Buses currently only serve the south side of the station, but FlexRide could potentially
serve the rail station in the future. Figures 7 and 8 show the station area and concept plans, respectively.

This station area is located in Louisville east of the BNSF trackway north of the South Street pedestrian tunnel.
Since the NWR Corridor EE, several developments have been completed surrounding the Downtown Louisville
Station area, including the first two phases of the Downtown East Louisville (DELO) development. The new
developments have constrained the space available for the proposed station site, requiring further evaluation
of potential station locations after the completion of this study. Concept designs considered where the
platform would be located as originally planned and forms the basis of cost estimates. Shared parking is being
considered on east side of the BNSF trackway at a city-owned parking lot, and bus stops may be
accommodated if the parking area is modified. Additional shared parking opportunities are under consideration
as the City of Louisville continues planning for redevelopment in the station area. Figures 9 and 10 show the
station area and concept plans, respectively.

Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station

This station area is located in the City of Boulder, on the east side of the BNSF trackway, between Goose
Creek Path and Valmont Road. The area west of the tracks and proposed platform has been redeveloped as a
Transit Oriented Development (TOD) with residential, retail, and office development. Boulder is beginning to
develop the second phase of its plan for the area east of the tracks (Transit Village Area Plan, Phase 1
completed in 2007).
The multi-level Boulder Junction at Depot Square has six bus bays and structured parking at the southern
edge of the development along Pearl Parkway, providing 75 parking spaces for transit use. A small parking and
passenger drop-off area has been recommended to be closer to the rail platform for the area around Bluff
Street, for accessible parking, as the existing parking is about a quarter mile away from the rail platform.
Further development would integrate the transition plaza to accommodate bicycle and pedestrian connections
and provide bike storage and ticket vending machines while maintaining the viability of the existing multi-use
path in this urban center. Figures 11 and 12 show the station area and concept plans, respectively.

This station area is located in Longmont, south of First Street, between South Pratt Parkway and Coffman
Street. There has been some new development around this station site, including the northeast corner of the
US 287 and Main Street and First Avenue intersection. Additionally, the area on the northwest quadrant is also
planned for redevelopment. This area has been planned as a TOD and would likely continue adding multifamily residential in the coming years. Longmont has worked with RTD for the past decade, and the multi-level
bus station and parking structure for transit customers would be located between the extended Coffman Street
and US 287 and Main Street. With funding from RTD, the station and TOD area are expected to become the
transit hub in the downtown area where local bus routes, BRT, commuter rail, and potentially FRPR could
connect one day. The remaining area is to be redeveloped with multi-level, multi-family residential units, with
the rail platform located on First Avenue, which is planned for closure. Figures 13 and 14 show the station
area and concept plans, respectively.

Freight Passing Sidings
Freight passing sidings are typically low-speed track sections connected to the main line typically used for
storage, loading/unloading, or facilitating passing trains in the same or opposite directions. The NWR
alignment currently consists of a single main line track requiring sidings to allow passenger trains to pass
freight trains that may be operating near scheduled passenger service runs. A representation of a freight
siding is presented in Figure 16. In this illustration, the freight train (right) is idled in the siding while the
commuter train (left) uses the main line.
During the commuter rail operating periods, referred to as time blocks, freight trains within the corridor would
be directed to and held in one of the freight sidings until commuter services were completed. The freight train
would occupy the siding while passenger trains operate on the route. Early in the Study process, BNSF
identified four freight passing sidings required to maintain freight rail service in the corridor. The four sidings
were consolidated into three sidings with capacity to hold four freight trains to minimize roadway crossing
impacts as BNSF developed its concept designs. Three freight passing sidings are required along the corridor
and will range from approximately 6,000 to 25,000 feet in length.

The general location of the three freight passing sidings proposed by BNSF is shown in Figure 16. Evaluation
and analysis of these proposed siding locations identified potential impacts on the community and surrounding
infrastructure. Surrounding communities also shared concerns regarding potential noise and air quality impacts
to residential neighborhoods adjacent to the sidings and blockages of critical roadways and neighborhood
access points. To reduce local impacts, freight passing sidings would be located and designed to:

19

•

Maintain a relatively flat profile grade to manage freight train acceleration and braking (reduces noise
and emissions impacts on adjacent properties)

•

Minimize or eliminate storage tracks at roadway crossings

•

Minimize impacts from noise, vibration, and emissions to adjacent sensitive uses such as residential,
schools, healthcare, or other sensitive uses

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
Rolling stock selection is driven by ridership, infrastructure requirements (platform height), propulsion
type, Buy America compliance, FRA requirements, and procurement considerations. The Study Team
evaluated various constraints (regulatory, operational, RTD requirements), physical configurations
(boarding height, floor height, and platform height), propulsion type (fuel, power), and commuter rail
vehicle offerings available in the North American market. Two primary rolling stock types were
considered: locomotive-hauled passenger train and self-propelled multiple unit (MU) trains.

Vehicle Types and Propulsion
Locomotives carry no passengers but are paired with non-powered passenger coaches to form a train.
The end passenger coach has an operator-control cab that allows remote locomotive control during
reverse or cab-leading “push” operations. Intermediate coaches only carry passengers. A fleet of five
locomotive-hauled passenger trains would each consist of a locomotive, a passenger coach, and a cab
car and serves as the basis for the cost estimate in the Study.
MU rolling stock types refer to trains with one operator who controls multiple power units distributed
throughout a train. In practice, an MU trainset is composed of multiple powered passenger vehicles that
form a single train operated by an operator in the lead cab. Single-mode MU vehicles use only one
onboard propulsion technology completely contained in the vehicle, such as a diesel-electric power unit
or a hydrogen-electric power unit. The most common types of single-mode MU fleets are electric
multiple units (EMUs) and diesel multiple units (DMUs). RTD operates EMUs on its A, G, N, and B lines.
Dual-mode MU vehicles have onboard propulsion technology and an electric current collection system
compatible with the wayside infrastructure.
Few options for DMU or dual-mode MUs are available in the North American market, and none are
currently in production. The only compliant fleet currently available in the North American market that
meet the requirements of the NWR corridor are diesel-electric locomotives with passenger and cab cars.
This configuration is readily available and meets the capacity and configuration requirements of the
corridor, but the rail vehicle market continues to evolve. Different fleet options may become available
when the project is implemented.

Constraints and Considerations
The NWR Corridor’s unique constraints require commuter rail trains to:

21

•

Have off-wire propulsion capability between Westminster – 72nd and Downtown Longmont; shared
tracks are not planned to be electrified due to clearance envelope height requirements

•

Not to exceed the maximum axle design loadings of the B Line undergrade bridges

•

Have at least 12 axles, as required by BNSF, for signal shunting (track sensor control) reliability

•

Provide level boarding compliant with the ADA at all stations in the corridor, including the existing high
platform stations

•

Include 5 trainsets: three in revenue service, one maintenance spare, and one operational spare

Under the operating plan to run three trains from Downtown Longmont to DUS during the weekday morning
peak period and three trains from DUS to Downtown Longmont during the weekday evening peak period, past
and current studies identified the need for a rail maintenance facility (RMF) in Longmont to repair, maintain,
clean, fuel, and store the new rail car fleet overnight. Unlike other RTD commuter rail lines, the NWR
commuter rail service would operate on freight rail tracks, which eliminates OCS-powered vehicles from
consideration due to clearance issues with existing structures. Due to differing vehicle types from the existing
RTD commuter rail fleet, NWR would need its own specialized RMF. RTD conducted a programming exercise
defining the RMF maintenance, storage, and administration requirements (Appendix B). The RMF in Longmont
would include a maintenance shop, employee facilities, administrative offices, and parking, among other
amenities. The following text summarizes steps taken for the site selection process for the RMF by RTD as part
of the Study:
•

Nine potentially viable RMF sites were identified. An alternatives analysis was conducted to determine
which would best serve the NWR Corridor.

•

Level 1 Screening: A fatal flaw analysis identified concerns from a preliminary investigation. It
narrowed the number of potential site candidates from nine to three due to a lack of ability to
accommodate the rail line, environmental concerns, or inconsistency with local planning.

•

Level 2 Screening: The remaining three sites (Sites 2, 8, and 9) were carried through a more detailed
screening to identify specific environmental and community resource concerns. In the Level 2
Screening, resource-specific environmental and community data was reviewed to determine the
presence of nearby resources and identify the RMF site with the least potential to cause impacts on
these resources.

Through this analysis, RTD confirmed all three remaining sites as viable locations for the RMF. The analysis
identified similar concerns at each site, including the need for right of way acquisition, wetlands mitigation,
historic preservation, and hazardous material testing. Because all three sites are in the same vicinity and
require private railroad tracks to access, RTD will consider different solutions to possibly operate on multiple
freight companies’ tracks. Regardless of the RMF location, the cost and impacts of the solution should be
similar between the three sites and will be considered moving forward.
RTD is concluding this effort with three potential sites and will not recommend a specific site placement of the
RMF at the conclusion of the Peak Service Study. Through the various analyses, it is determined that the three
remaining sites are all viable options and present similar obstacles and costs associated with these obstacles.

Rail Maintenance Facility

In addition to a newly constructed RMF, RTD continues exploring outsourcing fleet maintenance to a third
party for Peak Service. This option would reduce capital costs but increase annual operational costs. In this
scenario, RTD would still likely require the purchase of one of the sites for storage track, crew changes, light
cleaning, and maintenance facilities and to preserve the option to construct an RMF for a Full-Service scenario.
An additional operation or hand-off agreement may be required for this scenario and will not be determined
through the Peak Service Study.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
Roadway Crossings
There are a total of 37 at-grade crossings within the 39-mile NWR Corridor. An additional 1.35 miles to an
end-of-line proposed RMF requires four more at-grade crossings, including the US 287 and Main Street
crossing, to a total of 41 crossings. The crossings are grouped by jurisdiction in Table 2.

Jurisdictions along the corridor have improved the at-grade crossings over several years. Field inventories
were conducted to confirm existing conditions, which were used to propose improvements.
To date, there are 29 crossings that have been upgraded to a Quiet Zone or are scheduled to be upgraded.
Field inventories were conducted to confirm existing conditions, which were used to propose improvements.
Quiet Zones are implemented to eliminate the requirement for the train to blow the whistle as it approaches a
crossing. To qualify for a Quiet Zone, improvements must ensure the crossing will operate safely to protect
crossing vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
Potential improvements include gates, visual and audio warning devices, and civil infrastructure such as
extended medians and pedestrian pathways or sidewalks. Additional radar-based equipment and closed-circuit
television cameras are required by RTD to detect anyone trapped between the downed gates and to record
each crossing event.

Identification of Proposed Crossing Improvements

Using the field inventory and assessment in the Crossing Condition Inventory (Appendix C), a set of
improvements was identified for each crossing. The process of selecting improvements for each crossing is
documented in the “Traffic Operations Analysis Technical Report”; HDR; December, 2023.
Table 2 presents the improvements for the 41 crossings along the corridor. The crossing at Terry Street in
Longmont is scheduled to be closed permanently as a part of TOD in that area; that location is not included. A
new crossing is proposed by the city at Boston Street, subject to approval by BNSF and regulatory agencies.
The new crossing would be designed as a Quiet Zone. Columns including RTD indicate that those
improvements have been included within the Base Configuration design. Columns, including other
designations, indicate that the improvement already exists at that location or is anticipated to be implemented
by the local jurisdiction. Columns with blank spaces indicate that the improvement is not required at that
location.
To develop the improvements shown in Table 2, the following assumptions were used:

23

•

Radar and cameras are required at all crossings; only five locations have radar in place, and all will
need cameras

•

Additional safety modifications may be required near schools and other sensitive land uses

•

Cities will be implementing Quiet Zones before Peak Service begins in 2030 such that those locations
are designated as “City,” and those projects would carry those costs

•

Some civil infrastructure improvements are likely at most locations; improvements include adding or
extending the median to 100 feet to prohibit vehicles from avoiding the gates

B Line commuter rail service (solid line). NWR peak trains are proposed to serve along the combined NWR and
B Line route from Downtown Longmont to DUS.

Transit System Changes

Because the Peak Service Plan would be limited to the three trains in each peak period, there would be no
significant changes to the existing transit system. Bus routes would continue to operate as they would
throughout the day. Adjustments to provide feeder bus connections would be considered as commuter rail
ridership grows.
The existing bus system would support the initial Peak Service Plan even without redirecting buses to the
commuter rail stations. Table 3 shows the bus routes and any proposed changes for each of the six stations
along the route.

FlexRide is a successful paratransit service in Boulder, Broomfield, and Jefferson Counties. Consistent with its
name brand, FlexRide could be operated in a more focused approach during morning and evening Peak
Service. In certain locations, such as the area around the Downtown Louisville or Broomfield – 116th stations,
FlexRide could operate as a subscription service to pick up and shuttle patrons to and from the train within the
windows of departure or arrival. Once the subscription riders are served, FlexRide could go back to its
scheduled services.

Midday Storage Facility

A key goal of facility locations is to minimize non-revenue train movements to reduce system operating costs
and to avoid unnecessary impacts on DTO, the current operator of the B Line. DTO is the operating concession
of RTD’s Eagle P3 and is contracted by RTD to operate and maintain service on the A, B, and G Lines, along
with fleet maintenance for the N Line. The existing Commuter RMF is designed to accommodate only RTD’s
electric multiple unit (EMU) train fleet; therefore, a primary RMF has been identified as an overnight facility
near the origin of service (Downtown Longmont Station). Since trains operate in only one direction each peak,
a midday storage area near the service destination (DUS) is required. Two options were evaluated for the
midday storage facility:
•

Near Union Station at an existing Amtrak storage track (referred to as the “Greenbox Option” for its
adjacency to the Greenbox self-storage facility)

•

Northwest of the existing Westminster – 72nd Station in Westminster (on BNSF property between
Lowell and 72nd, referred to as the “Westminster Option”)

RTD conducted a simulation of Peak Service for both midday storage options. The simulation concluded that
both are viable under current freight and passenger service operations between Union Station and each of the
two layover options.
RTD staff evaluated the conclusions from the simulation and identified that the Greenbox Option created an
impact under the existing operating scenario (B and G Line service into Union Station) that requires trains to
utilize three platform edges at DUS for revenue service instead of two; the third platform edge is currently
used to stage a train in case of a service disruption. Its use as a revenue platform would eliminate the
possibility of staging a spare train at DUS, where it can quickly serve any RTD commuter rail line Further
complicating the Greenbox option are unknown future service changes for RTD’s commuter rail service
combined with the potential for schedule changes in on Amtrak’s California Zephyr and FRPR that could impair
the non-revenue terminal movements of NWR service between Union Station and the Greenbox Option.
Amtrak occasionally uses the storage track and may not grant RTD permission to utilize it.

RTD staff concluded that the Westminster Option provides several minor advantages under existing operating
conditions and poses fewer potential risks of future operating conflicts with Amtrak and FRPR than the

B.1.e

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
Greenbox Option. The resolution requires working with BNSF and DTO to secure the use of the Westminster
Option for midday train storage as the preferred midday storage location.

Operations staffing

Regardless of what organization is responsible for operations, staffing will remain consistent across the
management options. Facility staffing levels determine the number of parking spaces, the size of support
facilities, and occupancy levels. Table 4 summarizes the projected staffing levels for each group/department
to be located at the RMF to implement the Peak Service Concept.

Operations Control

Because NWR Peak Service trains will be running on BNSF tracks, BNSF will likely control the dispatch of
trains. In other locations, BNSF provides the dispatch from a central location, such as their Fort Worth, TX
facility. Because of the intricate interface at DUS with other commuter rail lines and Amtrak, a hand-off will
probably be made between the NWR dispatch and the operations of all trains in and out of Union Station. The
dispatch function by BNSF will also facilitate the movement of freight trains off the main line on freight sidings
for the periods in which the commuter rail trains are operating.
As part of their work to develop the preliminary design for the different track changes necessary to run joint
operations, BNSF and RTD will need to form an agreement to implement and operate Positive Train Control.
This process will take place as design elements are clarified.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

RTD prefers to be the operator of the services they provide. This is true for their commuter rail system, which
they own and operate. RTD procured DTO to operate those services for the A Line, B Line, and G Line
commuter rail routes. For NWR Peak Service, RTD may consider procuring operations from a private operator.

DTO operates the A, B, and G commuter rail lines. As part of their operations, DTO manages operations into
and out of DUS daily. Coordination with BNSF to hand off the NWR Peak Service trains will be necessary for
that program.

Overview of Ridership Forecasts
The regional travel model utilized by RTD, uses a coded network of roads and transit routes to generate future
travel demand forecasts for vehicle trips and transit mode share assignment. These forecasts are based on
primary inputs of estimated future socioeconomic, geographical data of population, and employment. Travel
models are calibrated at the regional metropolitan level based on observed roadway volumes and transit route
boardings. As such, regional models have inherent limitations when considering local travel behaviors specific
to corridors, areas, or segments. For example, it is important that the future socioeconomic data is up to date.
Because the model is built to produce a regional forecast, characteristics of local travel networks and travel
behaviors are not always accurately captured.

Current Ridership Forecast
The regional travel model developed by DRCOG and utilized by RTD was used to produce 2030 ridership
forecasts for the NWR Peak Service Study. The limited Peak Service consisted of three trains in the inbound
direction (Longmont to Denver) during the A.M. Peak period and three trains in the outbound direction
(Denver to Longmont) during the P.M. Peak period. The model indicated a forecast of 1,100 riders per
weekday in 2030. The forecasted ridership of this start-up service is modest, with each train operating at
about 60-65% of seated capacity.

Comparison of Travel Times Between NWR Station Pairs
Table 6 provides a comparison of the travel times for the proposed commuter rail service in comparison to the
current bus service between and among station pairs in the NWR Corridor.

Current bus travel times were provided by the RTD Trip Planner application by providing the trip pair and
choosing the fastest travel time if there was more than one estimate
Table 6 shows longer rail travel times at Longmont and then along US 287, where the LD1 operates with few
intermediate stops. Shorter trip times on the train are possible from Boulder and Louisville because of the
transfer requirement on the bus from local to the Flatiron Flyer. However, bus travel time to DUS is about 10
minutes shorter when considering only the Flatiron Flyer departing from downtown Boulder Transit Center,
even with the Flyer making each of the intermediate stops along US 36.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
To better understand the current context of the NWR corridor and the communities it would serve, a Study
Advisory Team (SAT) was established as part of the Study to guide the RTD team; assisting in identifying
technical team members, key stakeholders, and community members; establishing coordinated
communications outreach plans; and providing insight and guidance during key Study milestones. The SAT
includes leaders and representatives from RTD, CDOT, DRCOG, FRPR, and local communities and
organizations, including the City of Arvada, City of Westminster, City and County of Broomfield, City of
Louisville, City and County of Boulder, Boulder Transportation Connections/Boulder Chamber, and the City of
Longmont. SAT members also serve as liaisons between the Study team and their organizations.

Activities

The SAT met throughout the development of the Study to discuss specific items of importance. Five workshops
were held during the development of the Base Configuration, in which the SAT reviewed plans and
commitments, prepared for public outreach, and discussed Initial and Base Configurations, station planning
considerations, and partnership opportunities. During these workshops, members provided unique input on
Study topics from the perspectives of their local communities. In addition to meetings, the team also had the
opportunity to review RTD deliverables and submit feedback that helped refine concepts during key
milestones, including completing the Initial and Base Configurations.

SAT Input

In SAT meetings throughout the development of the Base Configuration, common points of emphasis included
station configuration, refinement of siding locations, ridership forecasts, and collaboration with the intercity rail
planning effort. Additionally, the SAT expressed general interest about the benefits of NWR beyond the
ridership potential, including improvements in multimodal access and economic benefits in TOD and downtown
areas. Overall, the SAT expressed support for Peak Service implementation and extent to which the Peak
Service concept and Base Configuration can be modified or expanded upon to include additional trips, reverse
commutes or coordination with intercity rail service in the long term. After this Study concludes, RTD will
continue working with FRPR on the potential for joint implementation of commuter and intercity rail in the
corridor.

Public Outreach
Public outreach conducted as part of developing the Base Configuration of the NWR Peak Service Study
included pop-up events, public open houses, and a self-guided online public meeting. The primary goals of
outreach were to notify the public about events and opportunities to participate in the Study and to share
refined draft concepts of the NWR alignment, stations, facilities, and service characteristics. Outreach events
provided opportunities for members of the public to share their thoughts, questions, and concerns or provide
general feedback about the Study.

others within the community. Non-traditional commuters (service industries and healthcare, for example)
expressed a need for different services. With many details still unknown, more than 200 people signed up for
email updates on the Study, which is expected to generate more public interest and participation during future
milestone opportunities. Appendix E provides greater detail about outreach activities undertaken for this
project.

To define the Base Configuration for Peak Service, the Study has utilized the significant volume of previous
work, the foundational investments in policies, programs, and infrastructure by the local jurisdictions, and
concept planning and design for the requirements that will allow RTD to operate commuter rail in the corridor.
The Base Configuration provides Study participants with a series of findings and outcomes for review and
comments relative to two other important efforts: the preliminary design by BNSF and the Service
Development Plan by the FRPR District

BNSF Railway Coordination

BNSF, through its consulting engineer, prepared the preliminary design plans and rough order of magnitude
cost estimates for the Peak Service Concept. The plans were compared to work RTD has done on the Study
and informed the Base Configuration.

Front Range Passenger Rail District Service Development Plan Coordination

The FRPR team is preparing a Service Development Plan (SDP) under FRA requirements that includes
alternatives development and analysis, governance, refinement, and implementation considerations. Frequent
coordination with CDOT and FRPRD allowed the Study Team to develop the Base Configuration in a way that
would support intercity rail improvements in the future.

Denver Transit Partners (DTO) Coordination

DTO is the operator of three of the four existing RTD commuter rail lines consisting of the A Line to Denver
International Airport, the B Line to Westminster Station, and the G Line to Wheat Ridge. The N Line to
Thornton/Northglenn is operated by RTD.
The proposed operating plan would have RTD assume responsibility for operating the three roundtrip trains
between Union Station and Westminster – 72nd each peak period (6 daily roundtrips). The reasons to
consolidate the train operations in this segment include the fact that expected ridership demands do not
require added trains at this time. In addition, operations into and out of the Union Station track configuration
would be significantly impacted by increased train congestion and the lack of available platform space at DUS
during the busy peak periods. This is especially true in considering the potential for added service from the
FRPR proposals and Amtrak. Continued coordination with DTO to develop and agree to an operating plan will
be needed throughout the following phases of any Peak Service project.

Other Considerations

Packet Pg. 452

B.1.e

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report

Potential Impacts
Potential Traffic Impacts

Station Area Access

Given the levels of ridership forecast, overall traffic impacts due to the NWR Peak Service are expected to be
minimal. Traffic volumes for this analysis are estimates based on the forecasted 2030 peak period transit
ridership presented in the previous section.
To conduct the assessment of potential impacts from traffic that will access the stations, a threshold of 100
peak period vehicles that would be generated by station activity was selected as the level at which impacts
could become significant. The level was established using requirements from corridor jurisdictions and
standard traffic impact assessment experience. Five of the six proposed stations fall below 100 vehicles per
hour in the peak hour, indicating that impacts from traffic accessing the stations are not expected. Only the
Downtown Longmont Station exceeds the threshold. That station has been considered as part of a larger study
and resulting project to establish a Transit Center for bus, rail, and parking integrated with a TOD
redevelopment project that is moving forward.

Traffic Delay for At-grade Crossings During Passenger Service

The NWR Peak Service will use the same tracks as the existing BNSF freight service. Freight service will be
suspended during passenger rail operations. Due to the shorter trains used in the passenger rail service, it is
anticipated that gate closures would occur for much less time than they would for freight operations.
Therefore, the passenger rail service is not expected to worsen traffic conditions during peak traffic
congestion. Furthermore, simulations using estimated traffic data showed that existing crossings would not
experience excess queuing during passenger rail gate closures.
As presented previously, the majority of the at-grade crossings have been or will be improved to serve as
Quiet Zones. Upgrades at each location would be made to be consistent with RTD policies and with
requirements for FRA and Colorado PUC regulations. Additional information on potential traffic impacts for the
at-grade crossings is included in the “Traffic Operational Analysis” Technical Report; HDR; December, 2023.

Environmental Scan Results

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Traffic operations impacts were assessed for station access, at-grade crossings under passenger rail service,
and at-grade crossings while freight sidings are in use.

The environmental scan for the Baseline Configuration focused on differentiator resources. Differentiator
resources have the highest potential to influence decisions during the planning process, may require additional
scoping ahead of NEPA, and potentially require longer lead times and a larger level of effort during NEPA to
determine impacts and commit to mitigations. The rationale for which resources are considered differentiators
is provided in Appendix D. Please note that the environmental scan is not a substitute for RTD’s Environmental
Evaluation process or the NEPA process. All resources would be considered during scoping for the NEPA phase,
as appropriate. Table 6 provides a summary of the environmental screening results.

B.1.e

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
Table 5. Screening Results for Differentiator Resources
Air Quality

Description
Based on a qualitative analysis of potential air quality impacts, if diesel
locomotives or DMUs are employed for passenger service, minimal emissions
would be expected during the operation. These emissions would primarily occur
during two peak periods: A.M. Peak for approximately 2 hours and P.M. Peak for
approximately 2 hours. Freight sidings, which would hold the idling freight trains
during passenger service, are expected to produce diesel emissions near
residential areas. The potential pollutants from diesel engines would include the
criteria air pollutants such as Particulate Matter, Nitrogen Oxides, Carbon
Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, and Volatile Organic Compounds, and mobile source
air toxics such as Benzene, 1,3-Butadiene, Formaldehyde, Acetaldehyde,
Naphthalene, and Polycyclic Organic Matters. A schedule or operations plan for
using the sidings is not known at this conceptual stage. Each siding is not
expected to be used during every passenger service session. Calculating the
distance of the emissions would require dispersion modeling analysis, which
considers meteorological and engine conditions. No modeling was completed
during this planning phase.
It is assumed that the locomotives or DMUs would be shut down overnight and
during midday layovers, avoiding extensive idling. As a result, even if diesel
locomotives or DMUs are used, air emissions from the maintenance facility in
Longmont and midday layover in Westminster would be minimal.
Ozone is a regional pollutant. Colorado is currently in violation of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone as established by the EPA in 2008 and
2015, being classified as severe nonattainment and moderate attainment,
respectively. Despite the Region’s violation, DRCOG’s Regional Transportation
Plan and Transportation Improvement Program will need to be updated to
ensure that transportation conformity requirements are met at the regional level.
Utilizing an electric locomotive for operations on the NWR ensures that no
emissions are produced.

Cultural Resources

39

Historic properties in the design footprint consist of 12 sites and seven linear
segments. In addition, nine cultural resources are listed as “needs data” and will
require evaluation to determine if they are eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places and are considered historic properties.
If the Section 106 process is initiated for a future associated undertaking, and
historic properties are within the area of potential effects, consultation may be
required with the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation to
avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects to these cultural resources. Analysis
of indirect effects, such as visual or auditory impacts, may also be required for
historic properties outside the direct footprint. If impacts cannot be avoided,
early coordination with federal, state, and local officials is recommended, as
applicable.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
Recreational Resources

Description
Several recreational resources exist within the study area. For the FasTracks
program, RTD has mitigated impacts considered high-moderate or above.
Additionally, if U.S. Department of Transportation funding or decisions are
involved, the resources could be subject to Section 4(f) or Section 6(f)
regulations.
Potential impacts on recreational resources occur primarily in two ways:
BNSF right of way linework overlaps with recreational parcel boundaries. It is
assumed that no impact would happen here, but the linework would be cleaned
up to confirm no overlap.
BNSF main line crosses an existing recreational trail or property. This occurs at
the following resources:
• Lowell Boulevard Trail
• Farmers’ High Line Canal Trail
• Big Dry Creek Trail
• US 36 Bikeway Trail
• Carolyn Holmberg Preserve at Rock Creek Farm – Hewit
• Coal Creek Trail
• Lewis Open Space
• South Boulder Creek Path
• Boulder Creek Path
• Foothills Parkway Path
• Pearl Parkway Path
• Goose Creek Path
• Cottonwood Trail
• 63rd St Path
• IBM Connector Trail
• St. Vrain Greenway
Additional analysis is required to confirm Section 4(f) and Section 6(f)
applicability for these resources and determine if impacts would occur. For
example, a trail alignment may pass over or under a section of the BNSF main
line with no proposed construction activities or improvements and, therefore,
have no notable impacts.
As design advances, avoidance will be considered an initial option in the next
development phase. If impacts cannot be avoided, early coordination with
federal, state, and local officials is recommended, as applicable.

Noise and Vibration

40

Noise analysis results from the model indicate that noise impacts, as defined by
FTA, are not projected to occur at residential parcels in the study area. Noise
levels associated with all three candidate transit vehicle types (locomotive, DMU,
and EMU) and freight train idling at proposed sidings remain below moderate
and severe noise impact thresholds at all modeled parcels.
Vibration analysis results from the model indicate that vibration impacts, as
defined by FTA, are not projected to occur at residential parcels in the study
area. Vibration levels associated with all three candidate transit vehicle types
(locomotive, DMU, and EMU) and freight train operations below FTA vibration
impact thresholds at all modeled parcels in the study area.
Note: Proposed Alternative Siding Locations #1 and #2 were not modeled for
noise and vibration impacts at the time of this analysis.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
Wetlands and Waters of the US

Description
Though dated, the 2010 survey data remains the best available. In the
intervening period since the survey, wetlands may have been filled or expanded,
and rivers and drainages may have shifted course. It is expected that current
conditions differ from 2010, but not to such a degree to undermine the
usefulness of this Study. Comparing the 2010 data to current (2022) aerial
imagery confirms this. Nonetheless, a current waters delineation would be
required to proceed with formal impact determination and eventual impact
permitting. The following potential wetlands impacts were identified:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Broomfield Station: Wetlands, 0.56 acres
Longmont Station: Open Water, 0.05 acres; Wetlands, 0.02 acres
Alternative Siding #2: Open Water, 0.04; Wetlands, (BNSF design)
Siding #3: Open Water, 0.23 acres; Wetlands, 0.83 acres
Siding #4: Open Water, 0.01 acres; Wetlands, 0.19 acres
Alternative Siding #1: Open Water, 0.03; Wetlands, 0.12 acres

This Study does not consider the connectivity of waters to downstream receiving
waters. Isolated waters may be considered non-jurisdictional pursuant to the
Clean Water Act (CWA), therefore obviating the need for CWA compliance for
their impacts.
Hazardous Materials

Based on the research and review of properties along the alignment and
proposed Base Configuration design, only two sites were identified to potentially
impact construction activities. Only one property was evaluated for mitigation
costs since it is an adjoining site to the NWR alignment. The second site was not
evaluated for mitigation costs because it was a potential maintenance facility site
that was not carried forward as part of the Base Configuration design.

Environmental Justice

The Study Team has identified environmental justice communities throughout
the corridor. Appendix DG provides maps showing the location of Environmental
Justice communities.
Direct impacts, such as temporary or permanent right of way acquisitions, are
expected to be limited to the acquisition of property for the maintenance facility
and station areas, as the Base Configuration is utilizing existing BNSF railroad
right of way for the passenger service and freight train sidings. Indirect impacts,
such as development pressure, may also occur around train stations. Proximity
impacts such as noise and vibration are not anticipated to occur at moderate or
high levels.
In fall 2023, the Study Team held an impacts and benefits workshop with
partners to discuss potential disproportionately high and adverse impacts. The
final report will include the workshop results in the Planning and Environmental
Study. During NEPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation will formally
determine if a project has disproportionately high and adverse human health
and environmental effects on low-income and minority communities.

Preliminary Right of Way
Expectations

Right of way acquisitions are not expected along the main line track alignment
and freight siding alignments for the Base Configuration, as these are assumed
to be within the BNSF right of way and would be included in an agreement
between BNSF and RTD. Station areas may require some right of way
acquisition for constructing and operating the rail platforms and ancillary
infrastructure.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report

Summary of the Base Configuration
Overview of Peak Service Operating Plan: The Peak Service Concept is an initial commuter rail service
along the Northwest Corridor, operating three trips in the morning and three trips in the evening during
weekday peak periods. The morning service would run from Longmont inbound to Denver Union Station
(DUS), and the evening service would run outbound from DUS to Longmont.
The commuter rail passenger service would operate on BNSF Railway freight tracks from Longmont to the
separate RTD trackway that carries the B Line Commuter Rail service between the Westminster Station at
72nd Avenue and Lowell Boulevard and DUS. The distance of the new alignment is 39 miles. Freight trains that
may be in the segment during those peak periods would be shunted to passing sidings for the duration of the
Peak Service operating windows.
Commuter rail vehicles would need to be different from the current RTD fleet because the overhead catenary
system to deliver electric power lacks height clearance for freight operations. Therefore, a different type of
vehicle that uses a different motive source or a hybrid of sources would be deployed.
RTD continues to assess operating scenarios, preferring to own and operate the service. Other options that
may include outsourcing are under review.
Station Locations: There will be six new stations between the existing Westminster Station on the B Line at
72nd and Lowell and Downtown Longmont. Table 7 lists the existing B Line stations and the proposed six new
stations.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report

Freight Passing Sidings: The Operating Plan for Peak Service will require any freight trains in the corridor to
pull into a freight passing siding located along the corridor. BNSF requires three freight passing sidings with a
capacity to hold four freight trains during when passenger service is operating.
Total Siding Lengths: Where possible, the new track needed for the Base Configuration would be built to
serve as a future second track. Slightly over 10% of the trackway is already double tracked. With the addition
of freight passing sidings the total double trackway segments would equal about 35%. This includes eight
bridges that would be widened or rebuilt to accommodate the second track.
Roadway Crossings: There are 41 existing at-grade roadway crossings along the Peak Service route. Of
these, the cities and counties along the route have upgraded or planned to upgrade 30 crossings to serve as a
Quiet Zone. The improvements include gated vehicle protection, bicycle and pedestrian safety improvements,
additional detection and safety systems, and civil infrastructure. One crossing will be closed as part of the
Downtown Longmont TOD plan. These are invested costs from the corridor jurisdictions and savings to the
overall required Peak Service commuter rail improvements.
Operations: There are several options available to RTD to operate and maintain the new Peak Service. A
summary of those options follows:
RTD plans to operate and maintain the commuter rail fleet for the NWR Corridor. Operations, vehicle
maintenance, right of way maintenance (as required by BNSF), and administrative functions will be staffed by
RTD or outsourced to one or more providers.
It is anticipated that BNSF Railway will require its staff to control train operations and dispatch trains through
the segment. RTD coordinates its current commuter rail operations with BNSF and other railroads such that
the Peak Service will be an extension of those relationships.
Two new facilities will be needed to operate and maintain the Peak Service trains:

43

•

Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility – Three candidate sites have been evaluated in Longmont as the
end of the line. This facility would provide heavy and light maintenance, store trains overnight, and
provide space for administration and other services. Expansion space would be included in the site.

•

Midday Layover Facility – Following an analysis of the space available and the operating requirements
into and out of Denver Union Station, the preferred operation would be to replace the Denver Transit
Partners B-Line runs both into and out of Union Station each peak with Peak Service trains. Those
trains would layover near the existing B Line Westminster Station in the vicinity of 72nd Avenue and
Lowell Boulevard. A layover facility to perform limited duties like cleaning and inspection would be
constructed in this area.
rtd-denver.com

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Level Platform Stations: The RTD commuter rail standard station layout uses a boarding platform that is
level with the floor of the rail car. This requires the platform’s top to be 50.5 inches above the top of the rail
on the adjacent rail line. The higher-level platform requires the station to be offset from the existing BNSF
mainline tracks for dynamic clearances for the freight train. The separation would be accomplished by using a
siding from the mainline that only passenger trains would use. The siding would be accessed through a pair of
switches, one at each end that connects to the mainline. Freight trains would remain on the mainline when
operating through the corridor.

Milestone 3 - Base Configuration Confirmation Report
RTD evaluated vehicles that are currently on the market, can serve high platform stations, and are both FRA
and Buy-America compliant. RTD determined that no vehicle option could serve both high (50.5” ATOR) and
low (8” or 22” ATOR) platforms and fully provide accessibility to all cars and doors on a train. One dieselelectric locomotive-hauled train was identified that falls below the maximum axle weight to operate on RTD’s
existing system, and the same manufacturer offers high-floor trains compatible with existing RTD platforms.
For purposes of this report, a diesel-electric locomotive with one coach and one cab car was assumed for this
study. This fleet option may also be compatible with the fleet used in intercity service.

Introduction

Project Overview
In November 2004, voters in the Denver Area RTD approved the FasTracks initiative through a sales tax
increase. The FasTracks Plan (RTD 2004) is a comprehensive program to construct and operate new rail
infrastructure and improve elements of bus rapid transit (BRT), bus service, and Park-n-Rides throughout the
region. The NWR is a 41-mile segment of the FasTracks Plan. Six miles of NWR are in operation as the B-line
from Denver to Westminster and 35 miles have not been constructed due to financial constraints.
RTD completed an Environmental Evaluation Study of NWR in 2010 and the Northwest Area Mobility Study in
2014. Since then, conceptual details have changed. RTD developed an intermediate Peak Service Concept for
NWR in 2016 and in 2021 the RTD Board of Directors authorized funding to conduct the Northwest Rail Peak
Service Study. The PSS will analyze various factors such as infrastructure improvements, train operations, and
service options. Subsequently, socioeconomic, physical, and environmental impacts associated with
implementing the Peak Service Plan for NWR will be completed following consultation with local communities
and stakeholders. The PSS will determine the Preferred Configuration for the Peak Service Plan, determine at a
high-level what impacts could occur during construction and operation, and provide a cost estimate to the RTD
Board. High level environmental and planning assumptions will be used in the decision-making process. More
detailed environmental planning and permitting information will be included in any future National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) clearances, if the RTD Board decides to advance the Plan.

Study Area
The study areas used for the establishment of existing conditions and impacts analysis of resources is
consistent with RTD’s FasTracks Environmental Resource Manual (FERG) (2021). In the event that an alternate
study area is developed, it will be documented in the resource-specific analysis. The general NWR Corridor
study area is illustrated in Figure 1.

The RTD Board directed staff to conduct the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (NWR PSS) to analyze various
factors for implementing peak period commuter rail service in the NWR corridor. The NWR Corridor would be
extended from the Westminster 72nd Station (current end-of-line station for the B-line) to Downtown
Longmont.

Roadway Network/Traffic
The FERG states that the Study Area for the Roadway Network/Traffic is the alternatives under consideration
and intersections on either side of the alternative or adjacent to Park-n-Rides. While only adjacent roadways/
intersections will be evaluated, mapping will show a one-half mile radius from the center of the proposed
platform.

The FERG states that the Study Area for Transit and Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities is the existing and
proposed corridor. While the focus of impacts will focus on these corridors, mapping will show a one-half mile
radius from the center of the proposed platform.

Existing and Future Land Use
The Study area for Land Use is a one-half mile radius from the center of the proposed platform.

Station Planning History
This memorandum provides a summary of previous station planning that has occurred along the 41-mile NWR
Line. As summarized in Figure 2, planning studies for the NWR Corridor have been conducted over the past
two decades, and RTD has continued efforts to enable NWR development.

2001 Major Investment Study
RTD conducted a Major Investment Study (MIS) between 1998 and 2001 for the corridor, which recommended
a set of multimodal transportation improvements including 28 miles of Regional Rail Service on one new track
and one track shared with BNSF Railway. The line would include stations at Denver Union Station, near US 36
at 104th Avenue/Church Ranch Boulevard in Westminster, Flatiron/96th Street (also called Interlocken
Loop/Storage Tek Drive) in Broomfield, Downtown Louisville, and 30th Street/Pearl Street (in Boulder). Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) was also proposed along US 36 as well.

customer parking, station canopies, ticket vending machines, and facilities for bus connections. Specific
numbers of parking spaces were not included at individual stations.

For the 2004 FasTracks Plan1, the US 36 Corridor/Longmont Extension included a 38.1-mile commuter rail
corridor between downtown Denver, Boulder, and downtown Longmont. The FasTracks line was proposed to
have seven stations at Denver Union Station, 71st Avenue and Lowell Boulevard, Westminster Promenade/
Mandalay Town Center (Church Ranch/104th), Flatiron/96th Street, Downtown Louisville, 30th Street/Pearl
Street in Boulder, IBM (Diagonal Highway), and Twin Peaks Mall (Diagonal Highway) in Longmont. The
number of proposed parking spaces from the FasTracks Plan is included in Table 1.

subsequent planning.

2005-06 Longmont Diagonal Rail Feasibility Study
The Longmont Diagonal Rail Feasibility Study2 discusses RTD’s proposal to add commuter rail service to the
Longmont corridor by using the BNSF track and right-of-way as part of RTD’s FasTracks Plan. The new
Longmont corridor service would extend the proposed Denver-to-Boulder commuter rail service from its
terminus at the 30th Street/Pearl Street Station in Boulder, to a Longmont Station proposed near Hover Road
and SH 119, near the Twin Peaks Mall. However, the Longmont Diagonal Rail Feasibility Study determined that
due to existing high traffic volumes, along with other issues, the 1st Avenue and Terry Street site in downtown
Longmont would be a more suitable end-of-line station site. Additional analysis found that the costs for the
extension of the corridor to 1st Avenue and Terry Street were similar to the costs associated with mitigating
the traffic impacts created by a station at Hover Road and SH 119.
A second downtown station was also evaluated. This would require an extension of service across US 287 to
the proposed Sugar Mill Station site. An examination of estimated capital costs and impacts associated with
extending the line to the Sugar Mill showed that this extension would be unlikely. FasTracks funds would likely
be insufficient to cover the Sugar Mill extension, so the focus in downtown Longmont became the 1st Avenue
and Terry Street site.

2004 RTD FasTracks Initiative

The intermediate station between Boulder and Longmont was also evaluated as part of the Longmont Diagonal
Rail Feasibility Study. RTD originally evaluated three intermediate station location sites but eliminated the two

sites proposed near Niwot and near SH 52. The report stated that RTD would continue to evaluate Boulder’s
Gunbarrel neighborhood station options near the intersection of SH 119 and 63rd Street.

2009 US 36 Corridor Environmental Impact Statement

In November 2004, following the initial development of the packages, the voters in the Denver metropolitan
area approved the FasTracks Program through an increase in the sales tax for transit purposes. FasTracks
provides funding for a program of transit improvements, such as rail transit and BRT improvements
throughout the Denver metropolitan area, including the US 36 project area. Due to this availability of local
funding for commuter rail improvements, CDOT and RTD agreed with FTA and FHWA to move forward
separately with rail and highway improvements in the US 36 project area. Once the US 36 project got to the
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), the proposed rail improvements were included in the No Build
Alternative, as they had a dedicated funding source (FasTracks) and were included in the conforming 2025
Metro Vision Regional Transportation Plan (Denver Regional Council of Governments [DRCOG] 2002) and were
therefore considered planned and funded improvements.
The No Build Alternative used in the US 36 FEIS included the seven rail stations contained in the FasTracks
Plan (South Westminster, Church Ranch Boulevard, Flatiron in Broomfield, Downtown Louisville, Boulder
Transit Village, Gunbarrel, and Twin Peaks Mall in Longmont). Additional rail stations at 88th Avenue/Sheridan
Boulevard in Westminster (now downtown Westminster), 116th Avenue in Broomfield (linked to the Arista/1st
Bank Center and BRT station), and 63rd Avenue/Arapahoe Road in Boulder, were added in the early planning
stages of the US 36 EIS process at the request of corridor stakeholders when the NWR Corridor and US 36
projects were one combined project. The FEIS concluded that the exact station locations and amenities at
each station will be determined in RTD’s Northwest Rail Environmental Evaluation, which was the separate
study that split off from the US 36 project.

Denver and Adams Segment
Denver Union Station has become the railroad terminal for passenger service in the Denver metropolitan area
handling RTD light rail and Amtrak services. Denver Union Station was to be upgraded as part of the
FasTracks Program, so it was included in the No Build Alternative. Improvements assumed consisted of the
consolidation of existing and future light rail tracks; the 16th Street Mall shuttle turnaround; commuter rail
tracks from the Gold Line Corridor, NWR Corridor, North Metro Corridor, and East Corridor; regional bus
(including the relocation of Market Street Station); and the future downtown circulator and pedestrian
circulation into one multimodal transportation center.

Westminster and Broomfield Segment

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

From 2003 to 2009, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and RTD, in partnership with the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), studied multimodal
transportation improvements for the US 36 corridor between Denver and Boulder3. During the project
development phase, both rail and highway elements were evaluated and combined into alternatives (or
packages of improvements).

There are three rail stations in this segment: Church Ranch/104th Avenue, 116th Avenue (linked to Arista/1st
Bank Center), and Flatiron.
All of the Park-n-Ride/rail stations for the Westminster and Broomfield segments would have parking on both
sides of US 36, except the 116th Avenue Park-n-Ride. The 116th Avenue Park-n-Ride would have parking on the

south side of US 36, a pedestrian crossing to connect the parking areas, and would be accessed by BRT on US
36 via bus pull-outs. Rail stations would also have a boarding platform to access the NWR Line.

There are three stations in this segment consisting of the Downtown Louisville, Boulder Transit Village and
Gunbarrel West (also referred to as IBM). Boulder Transit Village would have both bus and rail service. The
Downtown Louisville and Gunbarrel rail stations would be constructed as part of the NWR Corridor Project. The
exact location and number of parking spaces associated with these stations would be determined as part of
that project. The City of Boulder prepared a redevelopment plan for the Boulder Transit Village, which would
be located at 33rd Street and Valmont Road in Boulder, west of the NWR Corridor Project. The number of
proposed parking spaces from the US 36 FEIS is shown in Table 2.

As part of FasTracks and as a result of the separation of the rail component from the US 36 EIS, RTD initiated
the Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation (NWR Corridor EE)4 to identify and evaluate impacts of
implementing a fixed-guideway, commuter rail transit service between Denver, Boulder, and Longmont. The
project was planned to be phased. The first phase, from Denver Union Station to the South Westminster/71st
Avenue Station, would use Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) technology. Phase 2 would use Diesel Multiple Unit
(DMU) technology from Denver Union Station to Longmont and would share tracks used by the EMU vehicles
in the Phase 1 segment between Denver Union Station and the South Westminster/71st Avenue Station.
There were 11 stations included as part of the Preferred Alternative, located at: South Westminster/ 71st
Avenue, Westminster/88th Avenue, Walnut Creek (Church Ranch/104th), Broomfield/116th Avenue, Flatiron,
Downtown Louisville, East Boulder, Boulder Transit Village, Gunbarrel, Twin Peaks, and Downtown Longmont.
Four of the 11 stations (Westminster/88th Avenue, Broomfield/116th Avenue, East Boulder, and Twin Peaks)
would not be funded by FasTracks and would require additional funding sources in order to be constructed.
The number of proposed parking spaces is shown in Table 3.

2013 Northwest Area Mobility Study

The study stated that the NWR Corridor was an original element of the 2004 FasTracks Plan with commuter
rail service utilizing the existing BNSF freight corridor between Denver Union Station and Longmont. This
element of the NAMS Study evaluated operational/service and construction phasing options along the NWR
Line from the existing South Westminster/71st station to Longmont as possible early implementation options.
The Westminster/71st Station is the existing end-of-line station constructed as part of the Eagle P3 project that
built the A Line to the Airport, G Line to Golden, and this initial segment of the B Line to Boulder. Phasing
segments evaluated included Westminster Center/88th Avenue, Church Ranch, Broomfield/116th Avenue,
Louisville, Boulder Junction and Downtown Longmont.
The purpose of the study was to evaluate operational/service and construction phasing options. A key
assumption in terms of the potential segmenting of NWR commuter service was the need for BNSF to
“chamber” freight trains during those times that RTD’s commuter trains would be utilizing the corridor. To
prevent these “waiting” freight trains from blocking vehicle traffic for significant amounts of time at street
crossings, BNSF would require 10,000 feet of track without at-grade highway-rail crossings (unobstructed) to
the north of the segment’s “end-of-line” station.
The following chambering track criteria were used to determine the location of the track:






10,000 feet of unobstructed track
Double track
Avoiding grade crossings and/or minimizing the need for grade separations
Stage freight trains as close to Denver as possible while avoiding impacts to commuter rail operations
Chambering track would be incorporated into future segments of commuter rail

BNSF’s track charts and the previously submitted 30% drawings that BNSF developed in response to the RTD’s
operating scenario were reviewed to establish end-of-line sketches. Those sketches were utilized to evaluate
the feasibility of a particular segment to accommodate an end-of-line station location capable of meeting
BNSF’s 10,000-foot chambering track requirement.
Construction phasing was evaluated assuming possible phasing to the following locations:

In 2013, RTD conducted the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)5, a collaborative effort with CDOT,
DRCOG, northwest area cities and counties, and the public to develop a prioritized list of mobility
improvements for RTD’s NWR service area. The study evaluated transit options in the northwest region,
including the feasibility of extending RTD’s North Metro Rail Line to Longmont, adding new and confirming
existing plans for BRT lines, as well as service, operational, construction, and phasing options for a full-service
NWR Line with nine stations along the corridor.

In addition, the study team analyzed the remaining features of the NWR Line from Boulder Junction to
the end-of-line in Longmont.

Stations included in Northwest Area Mobility Study
The NAMS project focused on constructing the NWR Line in segments and would construct the associated
stations within each of the proposed future segments as they are constructed. The study included a total of 12
stations (including the existing stations at Denver Union Station, 41st Avenue, Pecos Junction, and 71st
Avenue/Lowell Boulevard, all of which are already built as part of the initial B Line configuration). The number
phasing by segment is shown in Table 4.

The study showed that Phases 1 and 2 could be implemented rather easily in terms of being able to make the
BNSF allowances work to chamber a freight train north of the end-of-line station in these phases. However, for
Phase 3 to Boulder Junction, the 10,000 feet of additional track would extend near SH 119 at Jay Road past
the proposed Gunbarrel Station location and require a new grade separation of North 63rd Street to cross over
the BNSF tracks and the northbound lanes of SH 119. Station layouts and parking numbers were not updated
as part of the NAMS analysis, as this study only focused on the potential implementation of the system.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The criteria described above to accommodate BNSF to chamber freight trains were applied to the potential
phasing locations. This analysis led to the specific identification of recommended phases for more detailed
analysis. The following phasing recommendation was approved by the Policy Committee for further analysis:

The study concluded by stating that for the NWR corridor, reasonable phases (or segments) exist for building
the NW Rail project at some point in the future. As owner of the corridor and operator of the existing freight
rail service in the corridor, BNSF has listed the conditions for their further engagement in regard to allowing
for the necessary rail infrastructure construction and agreements that would allow RTD to provide commuter
rail service on the BNSF alignment to Longmont at some point in the future.
Considering the costs of the proposed project, RTD’s current lack of FasTracks funds, ridership projections,
BNSF’s conditions, and other challenges within the corridor, the completion of NW Rail was considered to be a
long-term goal. RTD and the stakeholders agreed to monitor the various future implementation strategies on

an annual basis, as circumstances affecting costs, ridership, the status of BNSF’s freight operations, etc.,
continue to evolve. This conclusion was reached with RTD and the Northwest Area Stakeholders as part of the
Final Consensus Statement, dated May 1, 2014.

RTD recommended six stations between Westminster and downtown Longmont to support its NWR Peak
Service Plan (2017). The proposed stations for the NWR Peak Service Plan include: Denver Union Station
(already constructed), Westminster/71st Avenue (already constructed), Westminster/88th (Downtown
Westminster), Broomfield/116th, Flatiron (partially constructed with BRT and Park-n-Ride services), Downtown
Louisville, Boulder Junction, and Downtown Longmont. All stations would include bus drop-off lanes,
multimodal connections, and parking areas for Park-n-Rides that serve NWR, bus service, and BRT. In June
2021, RTD confirmed these station locations with local jurisdictions. Similar to NAMS, the NWR Peak Service
Plan did not update station layouts and parking numbers.

2022 RTD Northwest Rail Peak Service
Study
RTD is conducting this NWR PSS to better understand how peak period, peak direction commuter rail service
would work in the NWR Corridor. RTD Recently completed its Reimagine RTD project to better connect
residents throughout the region to be places that they want to go.

Reimagine RTD
RTD is facing many challenges, including dramatic reductions in ridership and funding resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, by 2050, population in the Denver area is expected to grow by
approximately 31%, resulting in increased congestion and an even greater need for transportation options.
These challenges, combined with the introduction of new technologies and limited options for increasing
transportation funding, is driving the need to reimagine RTD by looking at the transit network, services, and
business practices to meet the transportation needs of the future. Reimagine RTD identifies strategies to
better connect people to the places they want and need to go. Reimagine RTD redefines routes as Core,
Connector, or Commuter routes:




Core Route: Routes serving the region's largest employment centers, highest density housing, and
major trip generators with a demonstrated demand for a minimum of an 18-hour span of service, 15minute peak period and midday frequency, and service seven days per week
Connector Route: Local bus routes with a minimum 14-hour span of service (6AM to 8PM)
Commuter Route: Regional bus with limited stop spacing focused on serving a unique travel market
(e.g., downtown workforce, Denver International Airport workforce, and travelers)

The Downtown Westminster Station would be located about a half-mile west of Sheridan Boulevard, on the
south side of West 88th Avenue at Westminster Boulevard. Previous work in 2010 designated a shared parking
lot with 1,055 available spaces that was originally proposed with most of these spaces north of West 88th
Avenue. Further, a bus loop and a passenger drop-off area were proposed south of West 88th Avenue adjacent
to the rail tracks. These features were proposed to be accessed via the new Westminster Boulevard at West
88th Avenue. Since the original station planning was completed, the Downtown Westminster development has

Bus Routes Serving Station
The Downtown Westminster Station would be located on the south side of the street at West 88th Avenue and
Westminster Boulevard, approximately one-half mile west of the RTD US 36 & Sheridan Bus Station. The
existing station serving US 36 commuters has 1,310 parking spaces (mostly on the east side of US 36 within a
parking structure). The Park-n-Ride provides service to the FF1, FF3, and FF5 routes, and provides
connections to Routes 51, 92, and 100. See Figure 17 for existing bus routes serving the proposed
Downtown Westminster Station area.




Route 51: Sheridan Boulevard – Route 51 operates north-south service along Sheridan Boulevard.
The route provides 30-minute service throughout the day (with hourly service for evening hours).
Route 92: 92nd Avenue – Route 92 operates east-west service generally along West 88th Avenue and
92nd Avenue. The route provides 30-minute service throughout the day (with hourly service for early
morning and evening hours).
Route 100: Kipling Street – Route 100 operates north-south service generally along Kipling Street
(and terminating at the RTD US 36 & Sheridan Bus Station, where it operates along West 88th Avenue).
The route provides hourly service between 5:00 AM and 6:00 PM.

All three routes could likely be re-routed to serve both the existing RTD US 36 & Sheridan Bus Station and the
proposed Downtown Westminster Station, although likely only Routes 92 and 100 would serve the proposed
rail station.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
The US 36 Bikeway begins just south of West 88th Avenue at Turnpike Drive. South of the US 36 Bikeway, the
bike route connects to other routes which lead to downtown Denver. North of this location, the US 36 Bikeway
provides a direct route all the way to the Table Mesa Park-n-Ride in Boulder. The City of Westminster is also
constructing an underpass under Sheridan Boulevard to provide a bicycle and pedestrian connection between
the Downtown Westminster development and the RTD US 36 & Sheridan Bus Station. Along West 88th Avenue,
there are lanes from just west of Harlan Street on the east to Wadsworth in both directions. Bike lanes have
recently been added to Harlan Street between West 88th Avenue and West 92nd Avenue where it connects with
Westminster Boulevard. The bike lanes continue along Westminster Boulevard to just north of 98th Avenue
where they connect to multi-use paths through the Hyland Ponds Open Space. See Figure 18 for the bicycle
routes around the proposed Downtown Westminster Station. The City of Westminster Transportation and
Mobility Plan (August 2021) shows planned upgrades to the bike lanes along West 88th Avenue and West 92nd

In 2009, the City of Westminster began the process to transform the Westminster Mall, an auto-oriented
shopping mall, into a mixed-use urban downtown. The result of this process is a long-term development vision
that will guide the redevelopment of this 105-acre site into an urban center.
In 2013, the City approved the Downtown Westminster Framework Plan. This initial framework plan set forth a
framework of streets, public spaces, and land use that has served as the basis for the Downtown Specific Plan
approved on November 14, 2014 (and updated September 28, 2015).
The Westminster Downtown Specific Plan then intended to realize the vision of a high-density, urban-scale,

along West 88th Avenue, this once available surface parking area has been partially developed, and much of
the remaining nearby parking is dedicated for hotel guests and short-term parking for the Downtown
Westminster Development.

The City of Westminster controls the entire 105-acre former Westminster Mall site and there have been zoning
changes made to ensure that the development of the property occurs within parameters set forth in the
Downtown Specific Plan. South of West 88th Avenue adjacent to the proposed station platform, there are
several property owners where the station would likely be focused. Table 5 shows the property owners for the

Future Development
The 2040 City of Westminster Comprehensive Plan calls the area south of West 88th Avenue part of the
Downtown Westminster Vicinity Transition Area. In this area, Downtown Westminster Station is planned south
of West 88th Avenue at Westminster Boulevard. The Downtown Westminster Focus Area and portions of the
Vicinity Transition Area to the west of US 36 are located within a 10-minute walk of the planned station. The
plan notes that the pace of build out of the Downtown Westminster development and the timing of RTD’s
extension of commuter rail service will be determining factors for land use changes in these areas. Premature
land use changes could undermine the integrity of the immense public investments in Downtown Westminster,
while thoughtful extensions of Downtown Westminster to the south and west would complement the buildout
of Downtown Westminster and support the proposed Downtown Westminster Station with transit-oriented
development.

In meetings with the City of Westminster and the City of Arvada in October 2022, both communities expressed
interest in a connection to the station for Arvada residents just south of the proposed station site. Additionally,
there may be opportunities to connect residents in both communities with RTD Flex Route service for Peak
Period Service.

The land parcel bound by West 120th Avenue on the north, Commerce Street on the west, Wadsworth
Boulevard on the east, and West 118th Avenue on the south is proposed as Harvest Station Affordable
Housing. This is proposed as a 152-unit apartment complex that will be offered between 30-60% area
median income (AMI). The building will have a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, ranging in
size from 600 square feet to 1,200 square feet.
The land parcel bound by West 120th Avenue on the north, Wadsworth Boulevard on the south and
west, and Colmans Way on the east is proposed as senior housing. The Olivia at Harvest Station
proposes two senior, independent living apartment buildings with on-site parking and a public park.
The six-story building on the north portion of the site will house 160 senior housing units, ranging in
size from 750 square-feet for a one-bedroom, to 1,250 square-feet for a two-bedroom unit. The second
building is proposed as a three-story apartment building to be located at the southeastern portion of
the site. That three-story 60,000 square-foot building is proposed for 72 units that will be offered at
40%-80% AMI.
On the west side of Wadsworth Boulevard across from the Wadsworth Station Apartments there is a
planned multi-family development proposed to have 227 unites called Wadsworth Junction. Plans show
a combination of 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom units located within three apartment buildings. Buildings 1 and

Existing Land Use
The largest change near the proposed Flatiron Station is the Flatiron Marketplace Redevelopment located
approximately a half-mile southwest of the station site at the southeast corner of US 36 and East Flatiron
Crossing Drive. The project converted several vacant big-box retail sites into approximately 1,200 multi-family
residential units and 14,000 square feet of commercial uses at build out, to be developed in three phases.
Currently about 325 of the units have been completed, as part of the first phase.

The Downtown Louisville Station was proposed to be located between the rail corridor and SH 42 in the city of
Louisville. The 2010 EE illustrated access to the Park-n-Ride that would be provided from South Street and
Short Street from SH 42. At that time, the Park-n-Ride was proposed to provide 425 spaces. Approximately
one-third of the spaces would be located west of SH 42; the remainder of the spaces would be located east of
SH 42 at the shared recreational fields parking lot. The rail station was planned to provide passenger drop-off
and bus loop facilities adjacent to the station platform on the east side of the tracks. A pedestrian tunnel that

The Downtown Louisville Station was proposed to have 410-440 parking spaces between two lots in the 2010
Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation. However, much of the land that was previously proposed
for parking (160-170 spaces) between Short Street and South Street east of the rail line to Lee Street, has
been developed. The proposed shared parking spaces at the Louisville Sports Complex are still used as parking
and could still likely be used as a shared facility, as these spaces are largely used on weekends when there are
generally far fewer transit trips taken. However, it is likely that a new location for the station platform will be
required, as the development of the DELO Apartments has taken nearly all of the available land where the
station platform was proposed. The remaining area east of the rail line is made up of single-family homes in
this vicinity.

1st Avenue would be slightly realigned to accommodate the rail platform and would only be accessible
for buses to operate in two directions.
Boston Avenue would be the primary entry/exit for vehicular access to the Park-n-Ride.
Terry Street would be extended to provide vehicular access to the Park-n-Ride off of Boston Avenue.
South Pratt Parkway would provide access to the station area in general, but access to the station
would be from Boston Avenue due to the grade of South Pratt Parkway as it overpasses the rail line.

challenge from a redevelopment standpoint, so the challenge will be to minimize its impact in the short-term
and to recognize the importance of utility infrastructure to the functioning of the center city in Longmont.”

Existing Transit Service
The Downtown Longmont Station would be located on the southwest corner of the 1st Avenue and Main Street
intersection in downtown Longmont. The Downtown Longmont Station would be served by Routes 323, 324,
and the Longmont FlexRide. See Figure 52 for existing bus routes serving the proposed Downtown Longmont
Station area.


Route 323: Skyline Crosstown – Route 323 operates service between southwest Longmont and
northeast Longmont. The route provides hourly service between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM.
Route 324: Main Street – Route 324 operates north-south service along Main Street and east-west
service along Pike Street in south Longmont. The route provides 30-minute service between 5:00 AM
and 8:00 PM.
Longmont FlexRide – The Longmont FlexRide serves the City of Longmont from 5:30 AM to 7:00
PM.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities

There are sidewalks on both sides of Main Street, Boston Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and 3rd Avenue in the
immediate area surrounding the proposed Downtown Longmont Station. However, there are currently no
sidewalks along 1st Avenue. This area is expected to see a great deal of redevelopment in the coming years
and sidewalks will be provided throughout the new development areas.

There are north-south bicycle lanes along Main Street and on Terry Street and Lashley Avenue north of 3rd
Avenue. There are east-west bicycle lanes along Boston Avenue and 4th Avenue. There is also a multi-use path
on 3rd Avenue east of Main Street. See Figure 53 for the bicycle routes around the proposed Downtown
Longmont Station.

Existing Land Use
The meat-packing plant that was located on the northeast corner of Main Street and 1st Avenue has been
redeveloped as South Main Station, which will include 319 multi-family units in five buildings with 10,000
square feet of retail space when fully complete. Figure 54 shows the area where the proposed station
platform is planned. See recent station area developments around the proposed Downtown Longmont Station

Existing Site Constraints

The biggest site constraint near the proposed Downtown Longmont Station is an electrical substation on the
northwest corner of 1st Avenue and Coffman Street. While it does not preclude a station from being
implemented at this location (with previous plans showing the station being constructed south of 1st Avenue),
it does limit an entire city block from being redeveloped with TOD.

Future Development

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Table 10 shows the property owners for the previously planned Downtown Longmont Station.

The proposed station area is zoned Mixed-Use Downtown (MU-D) which preserves Longmont’s “Downtown”
and accommodates a mix of land uses including office, retail, entertainment, with supportive residential,
government and civic uses. This zoning designation is intended to encourage walkable and pedestrian-friendly
development that is well-served by transit.
On the northwest corner of Main Street and 1st Avenue, the 121 Main Street mixed-use development with 183
multi-family units, 11,000 square feet of commercial space, and 310 space shared parking structure is also
proposed. Land acquisition at the site is underway and construction is expected to begin in 2023. While there

has not been a significant amount of redevelopment around the proposed Downtown Longmont Station to
date, there likely will be in the years to come.

Each level of analysis has resulted in varying numbers of stations for the proposed NWR Corridor. In the
recent studies, the list of stations now focus on the following set of stations. These stations are being
evaluated as part of the NWR PSS.











74

Denver Union Station (Existing): Denver Union Station was already constructed as part of the
FasTracks program.
Other B Line stations (Existing): 41st/Fox, Pecos Junction and Westminster/71st Avenue which serves as
the initial end-of-line station for the B Line.
Downtown Westminster Station: The City of Westminster is now focused on this station, as it will
connect to the new Downtown Westminster development where there is expected to be a significant
number of residents and employees as the site is built out. Much of parking area proposed in the 2010
NWR Corridor EE is now developed or acts as overnight hotel or short term restaurant parking.
Currently, the focus is to utilize the one or two land parcels located south of 88th Avenue where a
connection to the City of Arvada’s Far Horizons neighborhood can be made while serving the
Downtown Westminster area which is expected to have over 2 million square feet of office space;
750,000 square feet of retail, entertainment, and dining; 2,300 residential apartments, condominiums,
and townhomes; and 300 hotel rooms. In the short term, buses could stop along 88th Avenue, leaving
more room for parking at a proposed Park-n-Ride. In the longer term, a bus turnaround could be
constructed on the west corner of the site.
Broomfield/116th Station: The Broomfield/116th Station is located approximately a quarter-mile east
of the US 36 & Broomfield Bus Station. The area has seen a great deal of development with even more
to be built in the coming years. The area between US 36 and the BNSF rail line will likely see the most
residential development as the area to the east of the rail line is made up of baseball fields and light
industrial/warehousing. An important consideration is the connection to the west to the existing BRT
station on US 36 and the adjoining Arista/1st Bank Center development. Additionally, an east-west
connection under the railroad would also expand bicycle and pedestrian opportunities in this area. It is
likely that some parking would be located on both sides of the rail line and there may be potential for a
platted cul-de-sac to be constructed to allow for buses to turnaround.
Flatiron Station: This station is partially constructed with the US 36 & Flatiron Station and Park-nRide already serving Flatiron Flyer BRT routes. There is a great deal of Boulder County open space
north of US 36 in this area but still more area that can be developed within the limits of the City and
County of Broomfield. This station would likely require some additional parking, as this station sees a
great deal of Route AB riders to Denver International Airport. RTD owns both parcels to the east and
west of the existing Park-n-Ride on the north side of US 36. Buses currently only serve the south side
of the station, but future Flex Ride could potentially serve the rail station in the future.
Downtown Louisville Station: There have been several developments that have been completed
surrounding the proposed Downtown Louisville Station. There is another development that is in the
planning and design process and others that are located further out as well. Concept designs will need
to consider where the platform will be located, and some facilities may remain closer to SH 42 and
Main Street in downtown Louisville. Shared parking is being considered east of the rail line, but
additional shared parking may be warranted here, which could serve commuters during weekdays and
visitors in the evenings and on weekends.
Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station: The entire area around the Boulder Junction at Depot
Square site has been redeveloped with a significant amount of new residential and office development



west of the rail line. The area to the east of the tracks has seen some development, but this area is
currently largely built out. The bus station is located at the southern edge of the development along
Pearl Parkway and provides 75 parking spaces for transit use. A small parking and passenger drop-off
area may be considered closer to the platform, which is proposed to focus on the area around Bluff
Street. This would likely focus on accessible parking. As the platform, parking area, and bus facilities
are already sited, the focus from the City will be to integrate the transition plaza to accommodate
bicycle and pedestrian connections and place required station infrastructure including bike racks and
lockers and ticket vending machines, while maintaining the viability of the existing multi-use path in
this urban center.
Downtown Longmont: There has been some new development around this station site including on
the northeast corner of the US 287/Main Street and 1st Avenue intersection. Additionally, the area on
the northwest quadrant is also planned for redevelopment. It is likely that this area will continue to add
multi-family residential in the coming years as well. The City of Longmont has worked with RTD for the
past decade and the bus station and parking structure for transit riders would be located between the
extended Coffman Street and US 287/Main Street. This is expected to become the transit hub in
downtown Longmont where local bus routes, BRT, commuter rail, and potentially Front Range
Passenger Rail could all one day connect. As noted above, the remaining area is proposed to be
redeveloped with four-five story multi-family residential units, with the rail platform being located on 1st
Avenue which is planned for closure.

Throughout the corridor there has been a significant amount of development around many of the proposed
stations as communities have worked to begin implementing TOD around the stations in their respective
communities. Station layouts will need to be modified for the stations being planned in the NWR PSS, as many
of the station areas now have development on the parcels that were proposed for parking areas.

Programming Report

Regional Transportation District (RTD) is conducting the Northwest Rail (NWR) Peak Service Study for a 35mile extension of the B Line commuter rail service from the existing Westminster – 72nd Station to Boulder
and Longmont. RTD plans to have new Rail Maintenance Facility (RMF) located in Longmont to support the
NWR Line. Initially, the facility will be designed for Peak Service operation. However, the site and facility will
be master planned for Full Service operation similar to RTD’s existing Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility in
Denver. The HDR Team is tasked with Programing and Master Planning the NWR RMF in close coordination
with RTD staff.

Purpose and Use
The purpose of this report is to define the NWR RMF functional requirements and space needs, which will
serve as a general basis for preliminary planning for the facility. RTD has not yet identified a specific site for
the NWR RMF. There are nine potential sites in the City of Longmont. This report will help RTD confirm which
site best fits the intended function of the site.
This document is intended for HDR Team use and coordination efforts with RTD staff. It is also a useful tool
that encourages user involvement in the review and verification of data and assumptions.

Report Overview
This draft Programming Report has three sections and an appendix. The final report will have five sections.
Below is a brief description of the contents of this draft report:

Methodology

This section describes the steps the HDR Team will use to define the NWR RMF Program Requirements and
Master Plan Drawings.

Basis for Design

This section provides an overview of major functional areas noted during interview sessions and the tour of
the existing Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility with RTD staff. It includes a description of the operations
anticipated at NWR RMF, including hours of operation, staffing levels, and planning issues to be addressed. All
of this is compiled for consideration during planning and design efforts and a summary of the more qualitative
planning issues.

Identify, Evaluate, and Develop the Functional Requirements
Develop a detailed Space Needs Program
Develop Functional Relationship Diagrams
Develop Site Master Plan and Concept Building Drawing
Develop a Cost Estimate

The best operation and maintenance facility projects begin with the HDR Team gaining an understanding of
the functions or operations to be performed within the facility. The HDR Team began this effort by meeting
with RTD staff for a programming workshop and a tour of the existing Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility in
Denver. This provided valuable insight and direction for the HDR Team, which may not have been relayed
through other programming and design methods. Subsequently, the HDR Team held interviews with the
divisions/groups to collect the specific functional operational design data for the Space Needs Program.
The information gathered during the programming workshop, during the tour of Commuter Rail Maintenance
Facility, at a follow-up meeting, and through interviews is documented in this report and will be utilized to
develop the facility master plan.

Basis for Design
The Basis for Design is an important element in developing the requirements and space needs for the NWR
RMF. The understanding gained by the HDR Team during the programming interview sessions and the tour of
the existing Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility in Denver greatly influenced the planning decisions related to
the functional design and layout of the building and site. The Basis for Design includes the functional and
operational requirements for the following functional areas in the NWR RMF:

Service Plan

The current Peak Service plan for the NWR Line is three trains each in the morning and three trains in the
afternoon during peak service hours Monday through Friday. The morning trains will run from the NWR RMF in
Longmont to Union Station and remain there until the afternoon service. The afternoon trains will run from
Union Station to the NWR RMF in Longmont. Once on site, the trains will be serviced, cleaned, and staged for
use for the next weekday.
Another option still under consideration is that the trains would take a B Line run and be stored in Westminster
during the day and return to Union Station in the afternoon, and then make the return trip from Union Station
to Longmont during Peak Service hours in the afternoon.
The future Full Service plan for the NWR Line is to transition to full service seven days a week, 24 hours a day,
with trains running on 30-minute headways.

Site

There will be no run around track on the site.

Right-of-Way

BNSF will maintain the right-of-way.

Functional and Operational Design Data

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

RTD has not determined the railcar types. The general assumptions for the Draft Programming Report are the
following:

HDR held interviews with the divisions/groups that will be housed at the NWR RMF to identify each group’s
functions, staffing and hours of operation, vehicles, and key planning issues. For staffing and vehicles, data
was gathered indicating the total quantities RTD anticipates being assigned to the facility. The following is a
synopsis of the data collected for each department/group and functional area.

Operations Administration

Function

The Operations Administration is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the NWR commuter rail trains.
This includes management, support, and oversight of engineers and the operators of the vehicles.
Peak Service: The hours of operation for Operations Administration staff is anticipated to be from 8:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. Monday – Friday.

Full Service: The hours of operation for Operations Administration is anticipated to increase to 8:00 am to 5:00
pm seven days a week.

Space Needs Program
This section presents the Space Needs Program for the NWR RMF. The Space Needs Program estimates for
Building Areas and Exterior Site Areas were developed to meet the operational needs for the various
groups/departments to be located at the NWR RMF. The space requirements for a safe and efficient operations
and maintenance facility and is based on applicable industry standards and RTD’s existing Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility in Denver.
The Space Need Program estimate includes the Peak Service Program Requirements, as well as a 30-rail
vehicle fleet. At the time of this report, the rail vehicle type was not determined. Therefore, there are separate
columns for DMU (Diesel) and EMU (Electric) trains.
A summary of the Space Needs Program is provided at the end of this section. This summary includes the
projected square footage needs for all building and exterior areas. These projected space needs are subtotaled
into net square footage requirements and totaled to include site access, landscaping, and setbacks for a total
site acreage requirement for the facility.

Space Standards
Space standards were applied to the Space Needs Program and generally apply to the Offices, Shops, Bays,
and Vehicle Parking Areas. Area requirements in Shops and Storage Areas were derived from functional
requirements and equipment space needs. The space standards listed in Table 16 were utilized to develop the
facility program and overall area requirements. The space standards are based on functional needs and
requirements established through the design of other facilities, rules of thumb, and specific requirements of
each functional department/group.

Circulation Factors
The space requirements shown for each function are net usable area. By using the urban design approach to
this development of the facility, the HDR Planning Team hopes to minimize the amount of circulation
necessary for an efficient facility. The three Circulation Factors utilized in the Space Needs Program are
described below

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Tracks

Interior or Building Circulation

This factor is applied to the program as a percentage of the total building square footage. It accounts for
miscellaneous building spaces, such as hallways, stairwells, custodial closets, mechanical, plumbing, and
electrical rooms; wall thickness; structure (Circ/Mech/Elec/Struct - Net: Gross); and access requirements.
Table 18 is a list of the factors (in general) that were applied to the program:

Exterior and Exterior Parking Circulation

This factor is included to account for the drive aisles, walkways, islands, and other areas created by site and
access inefficiencies. This factor can vary from 15 to 100%of the actual space occupied by a vehicle. The
factors used for the NWR RMF are shown in Table 19.

Site Circulation Factor

This factor is also applied to the program as a percentage of the total program square footage. It accounts for
areas around buildings, site drive aisles, building access, and site access. For new construction, a 100%factor
is normally applied to account for all site inefficiencies. As such, the better the site conditions, access,
easement, etc., the more efficient the site layout can become, reducing this factor to as low as 50%.

Department/Group/Area

Space Needs Program Summary
Table 20 is a summary of the Space Needs Program for the NWR RMF. It includes projected square footage
needs for building areas, covered areas, exterior areas, train yard, and vehicle parking areas. Site circulation,
landscaping requirements, and total acres required are also shown.
The Space Need Program Summary table has a Department/Area column that describes the major functional
department/group/area on the site, and then four additional columns. The first two columns (DMU – 15
VEHICLES, EMU – 15VEHICLES) include the quantity (QTY) - staff or space and Area (SF) required for Peak

Programming Report

Service operations and maintenance. The next two columns (DMU –30, EMU-30) include the quantity (QTY) Staff or Space and Area (SF) required for Peak Service operations and maintenance.

The Site and Building Areas are subtotaled, and a the Site Circulation factor is applied to determine the Grand
Total Site requirement for the estimated total square footage and acreage.

Detailed Space Needs Program
The Detailed Space Needs Program is included in Appendix A. It displays the same information as the
summary table, but includes additional detail for each programmed area.

22

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The Space Needs Program Summary is subsequently split into Building Area and Site Area areas. The Building
Areas section includes all the physical building spaces planned for the site. The Site Areas section includes all
the major storage and parking spaces planned for the site.

We make lives better
through connections.

This document provides an inventory of existing conditions of at-grade roadway crossings of the BNSF corridor
along the proposed Northwest Rail alignment. Thirty-seven at-grade crossings along the 35-mile section of
railroad from Denver to Longmont were reviewed in addition to four at-grade crossings between the terminal
station in Downtown Longmont and the planned commuter rail maintenance facility; conditions are detailed in
the following sections.

Contents
The at-grade crossings are grouped by jurisdiction: Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Lafayette, Boulder,
Boulder County, and Longmont. A summary of the crossings is provided for each jurisdiction that details which
have incorporated safety improvements to attain quiet zone status, general activity at the crossings, and the
general existence/condition of safety infrastructure at the crossings.
A single page is dedicated to each individual crossing that includes the following:

Introduction

Traffic activity is described as high, medium, or low based on the expected Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volume
per lane at the given crossings. The ranges used for these qualitative assessments are:
•

Low Activity = 7,000 or less ADT

•

Medium Activity = 7,000 – 16,000 ADT

•

High Activity = 16,000 – 50,000+ ADT

Pedestrian activity is a qualitative assessment based on field observations, surrounding land uses, and existing
pedestrian amenities and connections in the area.

Old Wadsworth Boulevard

Only the 88th Avenue crossing is currently designated as a quiet zone. Westminster plans to install quiet zones
at Lowell Boulevard, 72nd Avenue, and Bradburn Boulevard. The improvements at these quiet zones will be
subject to agreement between the city, the BNSF Railway, and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
Asphalt conditions are good or fair at all Westminster crossings, but the crossing panel and striping are in poor
condition at 72nd Avenue.
The 88th Avenue crossing has the highest roadway volumes and pedestrian activity of all the crossings in
Westminster. A median is installed at 88th Avenue as a safety feature; however, the crossing lacks a sidewalk
in the southwest quadrant to serve the high pedestrian volumes. The striping and asphalt are in good
condition at the 88th Avenue crossing. The Old Wadsworth Boulevard crossing lacks sidewalks entirely, while
Pierce Street has a sidewalk on only one side of the crossing. All other Westminster crossings have pedestrian
infrastructure along both sides of the railroad crossing.
None of the Westminster crossings include four-quadrant gates, and only two crossings, 88th Avenue and
Pierce Street, include medians. The other six crossings lack safety features to prevent vehicles from attempting
to drive around the gates when they are closing.
Only the Lowell Boulevard and 88th Avenue crossings have lighting on both approaches. Pierce Street and Old
Wadsworth Boulevard have no lighting infrastructure, while 72nd Avenue, Bradburn Boulevard, 76th Avenue,
and 80th Avenue have lighting on one approach.

Broomfield Crossings
Broomfield Crossings Overview

•

112th Avenue (borders Westminster)

•

120th Avenue

•

Nickel Street

•

Brainard Drive

All crossings along the route in Broomfield are designated as quiet zones. All crossings in Westminster have
safety features to prevent vehicles from attempting to drive around the gates when they are closing as an
oncoming train approaches. The Brainard Drive crossing has four-quadrant gates, while the other three
crossings have medians.
None of the crossings have particularly high traffic volumes or anticipated pedestrian activity. The crossing
panel, asphalt, and striping are in good condition at the 120th Avenue and Brainard Drive crossings; the same
items are in fair shape at Nickel Street and 112th Avenue. There is no lighting at the 112th Avenue, Nickel
Street, or Brainard Drive crossings, while the 120th Avenue crossing only has lighting on one side.
The Nickel Street crossing is the most geometrically complex of the corridor, as the crossing passes through
five turn lanes less than 100 feet from the intersection of Nickel Street and US Highway 287. The pedestrian
infrastructure at Nickel Street is in poor condition, with a missing sidewalk on one side and a significantly
damaged sidewalk on the other. The other three Broomfield crossings have no pedestrian infrastructure.

Louisville Crossings
The city of Louisville has four at-grade roadway crossings of the Northwest Rail proposed alignment along the
BNSF corridor:
•

Dillon Road

•

Pine Street

•

Griffith Street

•

South Boulder Road

All crossings along the route in Louisville are designated as quiet zones. All crossings in Louisville have safety
features to prevent vehicles from attempting to drive around the gates when they are closing as an oncoming
train approaches. The Pine Street and Griffith Street crossings have four-quadrant gates, the Dillon Road
crossing has a median, and the South Boulder Road crossing has both four-quadrant gates and a median.
South Boulder Road has the highest vehicular and pedestrian traffic volumes in Louisville. The city recently
improved the crossing and features asphalt, striping, crossing panel, pedestrian infrastructure, and bicycle
lanes in good condition. The Griffith Street and Pine Street crossings also experience significant pedestrian
volumes due to their proximity to businesses and schools. Pedestrian facilities at these crossings are in good
condition. The Dillon Road crossing has no pedestrian infrastructure but has much lower pedestrian activity
than other crossings in Louisville.
The asphalt condition at the Dillon Road crossing is poor, with vehicles having to slow down when approaching
the crossing due to roadway roughness. Two crossings would be affected by proposed sidings to
accommodate freight traffic during Peak Service operation: South Boulder Road and Griffith Street crossings.
Lighting is present on both approaches at all crossings in Louisville except the Griffith Street crossing, which is
lit on one side only.

Baseline Road

Baseline Road is designated as a quiet zone and uses a median to prevent vehicles from attempting to get
around the railroad signal gates as they close. The asphalt is in fair condition at the Baseline crossing, while
the striping and crossing panel are in good condition. The crossing does not have any pedestrian or bicycle
infrastructure crossing it. There is a trailhead close to the crossing that accesses the Callahan Open Space,
though there is no parking serving the trailhead and no pedestrian connection to the trailhead from Baseline
Road. Because of this condition, trail users may be crossing the tracks at Baseline Road on the shoulder of the
road due to the lack of a sidewalk.
The crossing has no lighting at either approach. Proposed Siding #2 would cross Baseline Road at this location
to accommodate BNSF traffic during the Peak Service. Preliminary analysis shows that the roadway may be
close to capacity as it is a two-lane roadway with relatively high volume.

Pearl Parkway

•

Valmont Road

•

Mineral Road (SH 52)

Four of these are quiet zone crossings, with the Mineral Road crossing the only one not designated as a quiet
zone. The Pearl Parkway and Valmont Road crossings are in excellent condition, and the 55th Street crossing
is in good condition. The Mineral Road crossing is in fair condition but lacks some safety features. The 63rd
Street crossing is in poor condition.
Pearl Parkway and Valmont Road experience the highest roadway volumes and pedestrian exposure; however,
these crossings also have the most developed safety features. Pearl Parkway has quad gates, median, good
pedestrian facilities, and roadway infrastructure in good condition at the crossing. Valmont Road does not have
quad gates but does have a median preventing traffic from crossing lanes while the signal is active. Valmont
Road also has pedestrian facilities that are in good condition.
The 63rd Street crossing is in the worst shape of the Boulder crossings. The road approaching the crossing is
in poor condition, and vehicles can be observed slowing down in advance of the crossing due to the roughness
of the road over the crossing and the worn-out concrete crossing panel. The roadway has no median at the
crossing and dual gates. Moreover, there are no pedestrian facilities crossing the tracks as the sidewalk ends
on both sides of the road south of the crossing. Field review showed some pedestrian activity using desired
paths north of the crossings, and it was observed that some pedestrians cross the tracks on foot despite the
lack of sidewalk facilities.
The Mineral Road crossing also lacks pedestrian facilities, quad gates, and a median. The road is in fair
condition, and pedestrian exposure is low due to a lack of nearby generators. The 55th Street Crossing has
good pedestrian facilities, but these facilities lack detectable warning panels on the approach to the crossing.
The pavement is in fair condition at the 55th Street crossing though the asphalt pavement between the
concrete roadway and the concrete crossing panel shows some wear.

The BNSF Railway through Boulder County closely follows the Diagonal Highway (SH 119), with all of the
crossings located within 100 yards of the highway on side streets that intersect the large roadway. Most of the
crossings in Boulder County are in rural areas with minimal surrounding development. As such, the crossings
generally experience lower volumes than other crossings along the Northwest Rail proposed corridor. The 63rd
Street crossing is an exception, with as many as 20,000 vehicles expected to cross daily. The Jay Road and
Niwot Road crossings may see as many as 10,000 daily vehicles, while 47th Street may see as many as 4,000
daily vehicles. All other crossings along the Northwest Rail proposed corridor in Boulder County are expected
to experience fewer than 1,000 vehicles daily.
Some of the most rural crossings in Boulder County do not include sidewalks at the crossing. The rural
crossings without pedestrian facilities are Independence Road, Jay Road, 55th Street south of the Diagonal
Highway, Monarch Road, 83rd Street, and Ogallala Road. Some crossings lie closer to developed areas, with
the Niwot Road and 2nd Avenue crossings located within the suburban town of Niwot. The Niwot Road
crossing is expected to have medium pedestrian activity due to a sidewalk that connects Niwot to a Park-nRide. The 2nd Avenue crossing is close to downtown Niwot, but it does not have a sidewalk and does not
attract significant pedestrian traffic. The 63rd Street crossing south of the Diagonal Highway is the only other
Boulder County crossing with a sidewalk. The Independence Road crossing is the closest to the city of Boulder;
there is nearby residential and commercial land use and an open space trailhead. However, the crossing does
not have any pedestrian infrastructure crossing it.
All of Boulder County’s crossings have been designated quiet zones except for 83rd Street and Ogallala Street.
However, there are plans to upgrade the 83rd Street crossing to attain quiet zone status. Each of these quiet
zone crossings includes some form of safety feature to prevent vehicles from crossing over lanes of traffic and
going around the closing gates as a train approaches. Independence Road and 2nd Avenue include fourquadrant gates at their crossings. Medians are included at 47th Street, Jay Road, 63rd Street, Monarch Road,
and Niwot Road crossings. Fifty-fifth Street has flexible delineators installed at the median lines.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Boulder County has the most crossings of any jurisdiction along the Northwest Rail Corridor, with 10 at-grade
roadway crossings along the BNSF corridor:

Roadway condition is generally fair at all the Boulder County crossings; the pavement at the 2nd Avenue
crossing is in good shape, while the pavement at the Independence Road crossing is in poor condition. Only
some crossings are lit at night: Jay Road, 63rd Street, Monarch Road, Niwot Road, and 83rd Street.

Longmont Crossings
•

Hover Street

•

Sunset Street

•

Ken Pratt Boulevard (SH 119)

•

Terry Street

•

Coffman Street

The first three Longmont crossings, Hover Street, Sunset Street, and Ken Pratt Boulevard, are relatively busy
roads, with the Ken Pratt Boulevard crossing the busiest of the entire Northwest Rail Corridor. None of the
crossings are designated as quiet zones currently; however, the Hover Street, Terry Street, and Coffman
Street crossings are slated for improvements to gain quiet zone status in the future. The Ken Pratt Boulevard
and Hover Street crossings use medians to prevent vehicles from crossing over lanes of traffic to drive around
crossing gates, while the other three crossings have no such features.
The Sunset Street crossing is less than 100 yards from a traffic signal which controls the intersection of Sunset
Street and SH 119. The pavement is in good condition, has sidewalks on both sides, and the crossing has
lighting on the north side. Sunset Street is expected to have medium pedestrian volume due to surrounding
businesses. The Hover Street crossing also has pavement in good condition, sidewalks on both sides and
medium pedestrian activity due to nearby residential areas. Hover Street has luminaires on both sides of the
crossing to provide lighting. Ken Pratt Boulevard crossing has a high pedestrian activity expected due to the
large number of surrounding businesses. Sidewalk conditions are good, and there is lighting on both sides of
the crossing.
The Terry Street and Coffman Street crossings are very low-volume roadways in poor condition. Currently,
there are low traffic volumes utilizing either crossing. As such, the crossings are not controlled by gates and
are only marked by the railroad crossing crossbuck. These crossings are expected to change as part of the
Peak Service plan, as they are close to the proposed Downtown Longmont Station. Per Longmont, both
crossings are slated to become quiet zones, requiring improvements to add crossing control and other safety
features.

These crossings are not part of the Northwest Rail passenger line that would be used by the peak service
trains. Future planning work as part of this study will identify the exact location of the commuter rail
maintenance facility in Longmont. The four crossings in this section would be used at different frequencies and
intervals than the at-grade crossings on the passenger line, and the schedule of operations for RTD trains at
these crossings have not been determined.
The Main Street crossing experiences high vehicular traffic and lies near the Downtown Longmont Station. It is
also south of the business district in downtown Longmont but lies near some businesses and large apartment
buildings. This crossing is the only one of the four crossings between he proposed station and proposed
maintenance facility that is planned as a quiet zone in the future. Improvements made to the crossing as part
of the quiet zone certification process are expected but have not yet been specifically determined yet. It has
sidewalks on both sides, and runs immediately parallel to 1st Avenue, which means the crossing substantially
influences signal operations at the 1st Avenue & Main Street intersection. The crossing is well illuminated by
lighting from the adjacent signal.
The Emery Street crossing lies approximately a quarter mile east of the Main Street crossing. This crossing has
been recently improved, with new signal equipment for both the roadway and the railroad as well as
sidewalks, drainage infrastructure, a median north of the crossing, and other civil improvements. Google Street
View imagery from July 2019 shows that the crossing was previously not signalized, nor was the nearby Emery
Street & 1st Avenue intersection. Despite these improvements, the crossing is not designated as a quiet zone
and is not planned to be in the future.
The Martin Street crossing is controlled by dual gates and medians, with the roadway and striping in fair
condition. The median south of the crossing is approximately 15 feet long and is unlikely to be considered as a
safety feature that would prevent vehicles from crossing over the tracks to avoid being stopped behind the
crossing gates. The crossing has a wide sidewalk on the west side, and no pedestrian infrastructure on the
east side.

Introduction

The Base Configuration for the Project was confirmed during Milestone 3. The differentiator resources
discussed below were assessed for impacts as part of the Peak Service Planning and Environmental Study.
This methodology is based on a review of the Corridor Conditions Report. The Corridor Conditions Report
Contains instructions for “Next Steps” for all resources.

Air Quality
Brief Discussion of Resource Studied

Air quality issues are considered in infrastructure planning to determine regional and local transportation
conformity requirements and to be considered part of overall impacts on communities. Mobile and stationary
sources of airborne pollution can affect natural resources and human health.

Data Collection/Methodology

Air quality was assessed within counties serviced by the NWR Corridor, including Adams, Boulder, Broomfield,
Denver, and Jefferson counties. The study area is located within the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) planning area.
Information on the latest National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment, maintenance, and
attainment designations for the study area was obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
online Green Book website (based on updates through October 31, 2022) (EPA, 2022), which provides listings
of NAAQS compliance status by state and county (EPA, 2022).

Findings/Results

Utilization of an electric locomotive for operations on the NWR ensures no emissions are produced. However, if
diesel locomotives or a Diesel Multiple Units (DMU) are employed, a minimal level of emissions would be
expected during the operation. These emissions would primarily occur during two peak periods: morning peak
hours from approximately 6:30am to 8:35am and afternoon peak hours from approximately 4:30pm to
6:35pm.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Differentiator resources were identified from the Existing Conditions report. Differentiator resources are those
that can influence decisions during the planning process, require additional scoping ahead of NEPA, and
potentially require a larger level of effort during NEPA to determine impacts and commit to mitigations. Please
note, the Planning and Environmental Study is not a substitute for the NEPA process, and all resources would
be considered during scoping for the NEPA phase, as appropriate.

RTD’s operations plan assumes that the train cars will be shut down overnight and during mid-day layovers,
thereby avoiding extensive idling. As a result, even if a diesel locomotive is selected, air emissions from the
train yards at Longmont and Westminster should be minimal.
The freight sidings, which would house BNSF idle freight trains during the aforementioned morning and
afternoon peak periods, are expected produce air emissions to the surrounding neighborhood. The potential
pollutants from diesel engine would include the criteria air pollutant such as Particulate Matters (PM), Nitrogen
Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and
Packet Pg. 647

B.1.e

Base Configuration Environmental Scan
mobile source air toxics such as Benzene, 1,3-Butadiene, Formaldehyde, Acetaldehyde, Naphthalene, and
Polycyclic Organic Matters. The idling would occur 2 hours at a time during the each of the peak operating
periods.

The study area is located in the Denver Metropolitan Area, designated a maintenance area for carbon
monoxide and PM10. Per 40 CFR 93.102(b)(4), transportation conformity applies to maintenance areas through
the 20-year maintenance planning period unless the maintenance plan specifies that the transportation
conformity requirements apply for a more extended period. According to the EPA Greenbook and the State
Implementation Plan, the 20-year maintenance statuses for carbon monoxide and PM10 lapsed in 2022. As
such, transportation conformity requirements for these pollutants will no longer apply. Therefore, quantitative
carbon monoxide and PM10 hotspot analysis will not be required.
Transportation conformity still applies for ozone (precursor pollutants – nitrogen oxides and volatile organic
compounds) in the study area, given that the region is currently in nonattainment status for the ozone
National Ambient Air Quality Standard. However, a conformity demonstration for ozone does not require hot
spot analysis. Rather, it can be demonstrated for a project by documenting that it is included in the latest
approved long-range transportation plan and TIP. The interagency consultation process for NEPA will confirm
the transportation conformity approaches.
The Northwest Rail Peak Service Study does not intend to select a specific vehicle technology for the proposed
service. However, it is possible that Peak Service on the NWR Corridor could increase diesel trains in the
region. At this time, no vehicle technology is being eliminated from consideration other than overhead
catenary system (OCS) powered electric vehicles. If diesel trains are implemented, the increased mobile source
air toxics (MSAT) emissions from diesel trains could be offset by the vehicle mile travel reduction in the region.
Per the 2016 FHWA’s MSAT guidance, NWR will be classified as Tier 1, Project with No Meaningful Potential
MSAT Effects or exempt project because the NWR Corridor will likely reduce traffic volume in the region. The
interagency consultation process for NEPA will confirm the MSAT analysis approaches.
Mitigation for long-term and construction-related air quality impacts will be developed on a project-to-project
basis during NEPA, as applicable. Air quality mitigation measures for construction activities typically involve
dust control measures and ensuring that equipment is properly maintained to eliminate any continuously
visible exhaust emissions.
CDOT’s Clean Transportation Strategic Policy Initiative (CDOT, 2022) will also be considered during the
Planning and Environmental Study and NEPA. Updated CDOT-specific requirements during NEPA will be
incorporated into projects and consistent with the future CDOT Performance Plan FY 2021-2022.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Compliance Considerations

Finally, CDOT’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap pointed out that reducing vehicle miles traveled is
essential to achieving the statewide greenhouse gas target. The NWR Corridor will introduce a viable way to
change transportation from automobile to public transit. Therefore, the NEPA process can point out that the
NWR Corridor can contribute to regional greenhouse gas reduction.

Noise and Vibration
This section discusses the noise and ground-borne vibration assessments performed to evaluate noise and
vibration conditions in the study area under the Build Alternative. These analyses focused on lands where
overnight sleep occurs (FTA Land Use Category 2) to simplify the assessments and provide an initial order of
magnitude estimate of potential noise and vibration effects on a level commensurate with the amount of
engineering detail available to decision-makers. The Noise and Vibration Technical Report is attached
(Attachment 1).
Noise is typically defined as unwanted or excessive sound. Sound becomes unwanted when it interferes with
sleep, speech, or recreation activities. Sound is what we hear when fluctuations in air pressure occur above
and below the standard atmospheric pressure. Three variables define noise characteristics: level (or
amplitude), frequency, and time pattern. Ground-borne vibration consists of rapidly fluctuating ground motions
transmitted into a receptor (building) from a vibration source, such as transit trains. FTA uses vibration
velocity to describe vibration levels for transit projects.

Data Collection/Methodology

The noise and vibration analyses performed for this project are based on FTA noise and vibration impact
assessment methods. FTA’s methodologies consist of a screening assessment in which analysts determine if
noise- or vibration-sensitive land uses are close enough to the new alignment to merit an impact assessment.
If so, the next step in FTA’s methodologies is a general noise and vibration analysis. There is also a third level
of FTA impact assessments, which examines noise and vibration in detail, but those were not applied to this
project.
The Corridor Conditions Report contains results of the screening assessments and the general assessments of
existing noise and vibration. The Noise and Vibration Technical Report (Attachment 1) includes additional
description of the methodology.

Findings/Results

Noise analysis results indicate that noise impacts as defined by FTA are not projected to occur at residential
parcels in the study area. Noise levels associated with all three candidate transit vehicle types and freight
train operations as described above remain below moderate and severe noise impact thresholds at all modeled
parcels

Vibration analysis results indicate that vibration impacts as defined by FTA are not projected to occur at
residential parcels in the study area. Vibration levels associated with all three candidate transit vehicle types
and freight train operations as described above remain below FTA vibration impact thresholds at all modeled
parcels in the study area.

Compliance Considerations

During NEPA, noise and vibration will be evaluated at parcels in all three FTA land use categories and at
“special buildings” locations like recording and broadcast studios. This analysis will focus on lands where
overnight sleep occurs to simplify the assessments and provide an initial order of magnitude estimate of

potential noise and vibration impacts on a level commensurate with the amount of engineering detail available
to decision-makers.

The purpose of this section is to identify conflicts between known cultural resources and proposed upgrades,
developments, and improvements for Peak Service implementation for the NWR Corridor. The previous NWR
Corridor Conditions Report included a study of existing conditions for cultural resources. This study queried
databases for the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) and local landmark
commissions and identified 1,607 known cultural resources within a 1,000-foot buffer from the existing BNSF
corridor centerline and a 0.5-mile buffer from each new station platform. This section will supplement the
previous report by identifying known cultural resources which are within the construction footprint of proposed
design elements. This section frames discussions around potential future consultation or mitigation
requirements for cultural resources which may be directly affected by project design.

Brief Description of Resource Studied

Cultural resources include both historical built environment resources and archaeological resources. Under the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), the significance of a cultural resource is determined by its
eligibility to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Cultural resources which are eligible
for, or listed on, the NRHP are considered historic properties. Under the NRHP eligibility guidelines, potential
historic properties must be 50 years of age or more, meet at least one of four criteria for significance, and
retain sufficient integrity to convey that significance. Historic properties can be classified as sites, buildings,
structures, objects, or districts. For linear cultural resources, such as historical roads or railroads, segments of
resources may be considered as supporting or non-supporting of the NRHP eligibility of the overall resource.
Cultural resources may also be significant if they are designated as a local historic landmark or are listed on, or
eligible for listing on, the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties. Historical built environment resources
include building, structure, and district property-types. Historical built environment resources identified by the
previous NWR Corridor Conditions Report include single-family homes, commercial storefronts, bridges,
culverts, ditches, roads, residential neighborhoods, and commercial downtown areas. Archaeological resources
may range in age from the arrival of Indigenous peoples in Colorado over 13,000 years ago to 50 years before
present. Archaeological resources identified by the previous NWR Corridor Conditions Report include
precontact camps, historical mines, historical refuse dumps, historical artifact scatters, and historical building
foundations. As with historical built environment resources, archaeological resources have the potential to be
historic properties if they meet one of the four criteria needed for listing in the NRHP (36 CFR 60.4). However,
archaeological resources may be subject to additional statutory requirements, including laws such as the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
(NAGPRA). Information on archaeological sites may also be subject to additional confidentiality and data
sharing restrictions.

Cultural Resources

Data Collection/Methodology

The OAHP is the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the State of Colorado. As the SHPO, the OAHP
enforces the procedural requirements of the NHPA and consults on projects which may cause adverse effects
to historic properties. Adverse effects are defined as alterations to the character or use of the cultural resource

which limit its ability to convey its historical significance under the NRHP. To identify potential historic
properties which may be adversely affected during future stages of the project, a file search of Colorado OAHP
records was completed on October 25, 2022. File search results from the OAHP database also include NRHP
eligibility status for each cultural resource. Because the OAHP database does not always include recent surveys
or information on local landmarks, seven local landmark commissions with jurisdictions overlapping the
planning area were identified and contacted for information on protected local landmarks within the study
corridor. The identified landmark commissions include the Boulder County Historic Preservation Advisory
Board, Longmont Historic Preservation Commission, Boulder Landmarks Board, Louisville Historic Preservation
Commission, City and County of Broomfield Historic Landmark Board, Jefferson County Historical Commission,
and Westminster Historic Landmark Board. Of these local historic preservation authorities, Boulder, Louisville,
the City and County of Broomfield, and Westminster contributed data to supplement the historic resources
recorded within the OAHP database.
To supplement this previous file search and identify potential conflicts between known cultural resources and
Peak Service implementation for the NWR Corridor, geospatial data for cultural resource locations was
compared to preliminary design plans. Documented cultural resources which are within, cross, or overlap the
direct footprint of proposed developments were identified as potentially being affected by future development
for the project. The OAHP documented NRHP eligibility or local landmark status for these cultural resources
was assessed to identify resources which may require consultation, mitigation, or further study. This analysis
accounts only for potential direct effects from the limit of construction (LOC) and does not consider indirect
impacts to cultural resources, such as visual or auditory effects.

Findings/Results

The previous OAHP file search identified 1,607 known cultural resources within a 1,000-foot buffer from the
existing BNSF corridor centerline and a 0.5-mile buffer from each new station platform. Of these, 46 previously
documented cultural resources directly overlap the LOC for freight rail sidings, station locations, walls, bridges,
maintenance sites (Figure 1 to Figure 6). One historical archaeological site and 45 historical resources are
within these areas. No precontact archaeological resources are known within the direct project footprint. In
addition, linear resources (e.g. railroads) intersect proposed project developments at multiple locations.
Cultural resources which overlap the LOC for proposed stations are shown in Figure 1 to Figure 6. Known
cultural resources which are within the footprint for proposed Longmont maintenance facility sites are shown
in Figure 7. Existing cultural resources which intersect proposed improvements for rail sidings are shown in
Figure 8 to Figure 11. (Note: Locations of sidings may continue to be revised and the project progresses).

Of these 46 cultural resources, 26 have an official determination of eligibility for the NRHP. An official
determination means that the Colorado OAHP has reviewed and concurred with the NRHP determination of
eligibility for the cultural resource. Of these, 12 resources are officially eligible, and 14 resources are officially
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. There are nine cultural resources which require additional data (“Needs
Data”) for an NRHP determination. Of the remaining cultural resources, seven are linear segments which
support the eligibility of an eligible linear resource, and four are linear segments which are non-supporting of
the eligibility of a linear resource. There are no designated local landmarks within these areas. Table 2 shows
the NRHP eligibility status of known cultural resources within the footprint of proposed project design
elements.

Cultural resources reviews under Section 106 of the NHPA and Section 4(f) of the Department of
Transportation (DOT) Act may be required alongside future compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA). Each of these statutes require consideration of effects on cultural resources. Section 106 of the
NHPA requires federal agencies to consider project effects on NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible properties when a
project is determined to constitute a federal undertaking. An undertaking is defined as any action which
requires federal funds, permitting or licensure, or occurs on federal property and has the potential to affect
properties listed in or eligible for listing in the NRHP. If the lead federal agency determines a project is an
undertaking under Section 106 of the NHPA, an Area of Potential Effects (APE) will be delineated specific to
the parameters and scope of that project. Identification and evaluation surveys of historic resources within a
project-specific APE may be conducted to identify potential cultural resources which are not currently known.
In contrast to the procedural requirements of the NHPA, Section 4(f) imposes substantive requirements on
federal agencies. Section 4(f) prohibits the United States DOT from impacting parks, recreation areas, wildlife
and waterfowl refuges, and historic properties unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative to that use.
The action must also consider ways to minimize harm to the property resulting from such a use. An adverse
effect determination under Section 106 of the NHPA will also typically constitute a use under Section 4(f).
Historic properties in the design footprint consist of 12 sites and seven linear segments. In addition, the nine
cultural resources which are listed as “needs data” will require NRHP evaluation to determine if they are
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and constitute historic properties. If the Section 106 process is initiated for a
future undertaking associated with the project, and historic properties are with the APE, consultation may be
required with the OAHP to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects to these cultural resources. Analysis of
indirect effects, such as visual or auditory impacts, may also be required for historic properties which are
outside of the direct project footprint.

Recreational Resources
Recreational resources, including parks, trails, open space areas, and wildlife and waterfowl
refuges are important community assets that provide environmental, aesthetic, and recreational
benefits. Additionally, these recreational resources may be eligible for protection under Section
4(f) of the USDOT Act and Section 6(f) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. Section
4(f) properties include publicly owned public parks, recreation areas, wildlife, or waterfowl
refuges, or any publicly or privately owned historic site listed or eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Although not explicitly mentioned in the regulation, trails/multi-use paths and open space areas
qualify as Section 4(f) resources if they are publicly owned, and its purpose is for park,
recreation, or refuge activities. Section 6(f) properties have been funded through Land and
Water Conservation Funds, which provides them special protections against converting their use
from that investment.

Data Collection/Methodology

The study area for this analysis encompasses a 300-foot buffer from the edge of the right of
way of the BNSF corridor and a 300-foot buffer around each station. Colorado Trail Explorer
(CoTrex, 2020) trails and trailheads were downloaded as shapefiles and uploaded into ArcGIS
Pro to overlay with the study area. New trail information was obtained from city and county
comprehensive and master plans (City of Westminster Comprehensive Plan, 2021; City of
Louisville Transportation Master Plan, 2019; South Boulder Road Small Area Plan, 2016;
Southeast Longmont Urban Renewal Plan, 2006; Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, 2020; City
and County of Broomfield Comprehensive Plan, 2016). Parklands and open spaces, size,
location, and ownership were obtained from DRCOG Parks and Open Space Layer (DRCOG,
2021). Parks and recreational resource descriptions were obtained using publicly available data
from the respective county or city website. Section 6(f) data were obtained from CDOT’s Online
Transportation Information System database (CDOT, 2022), which tracks properties with Land
and Water Conservation funding.

Findings/Results

Recreational resources, including parks, open space properties, conservation easements, trails,
and assumed Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) properties within the study area, are included in
Table 3. Figure 12 through Figure 15 show the locations of these resources.

Several recreational resources exist within the study area. The Planning and Environmental
Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts and environmental constraints,
with further recommendations on how to proceed during subsequent environmental and design
project development steps, as applicable. For the FasTracks program, RTD has mitigated
impacts considered high-moderate or above. During NEPA, additional study areas may be
required to consider constructive use. Public parks and recreational facilities are protected by
Section 4(f), which requires that these properties be avoided unless there are no feasible or
prudent alternatives. As design advances, avoidance will be considered an initial option in the
next development phase. If the project cannot avoid using a Section 4(f) property, a Section
4(f) Evaluation will be required, and concurrence on minimization and mitigation measures from
the officials with jurisdiction over the affected properties will be necessary. Early coordination
with officials with jurisdiction will be required.
If it is determined that the project may impact a property protected under Section 6(f), similarly
to Section 4(f), design considerations to avoid the property are required. If a conversion of the
parkland from a recreation to a transportation use is necessary, coordination between the CPW
and the National Park Service / US Department of Interior will be required, and replacement
parkland will be identified.
To avoid delays, early coordination with applicable agencies and stakeholders will occur at the
onset of preliminary design and NEPA and continue through the alternatives selection process
so that concurrence can be achieved through the Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) processes as
efficiently as possible.

Hazardous Materials
Brief Discussion of Resource Studied

The acquisition of property right of way and potential construction disturbance requires the
evaluation of hazardous material concerns to protect worker health and safety and public
health, to provide liability due diligence for the purchasing entity, and improve the alternatives
analysis based on potential hazardous material impacts. The Environmental Liability Study is
attached (Attachment 2), and the results are discussed within this section.
Hazardous material sites are those properties that have been impacted by a current or previous
use that could have resulted in a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products. These
materials could include pesticides, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, heavy metals,
petroleum products (gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricants), lead-based paint, and asbestos-containing
building materials.

The RECs identified in the CCR were further researched in this environmental liability review, to
verify the presence of contaminated sites adjoining the Project alignment. Environmental
liability refers to the potential environmental costs that a property and/or properties may
require to remove contamination disturbed during construction. The properties listed as RECs
along the Project alignment were screened by researching the past and present use and
constituents of concern in soil and groundwater. The properties were reviewed in the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) online website to determine their
potential to contaminate the Project, and the Boulder, Jefferson, and Adams County Assessor to
review parcel information. The location of the properties with RECs were evaluated in relation to
the railroad alignment, to assess impacts to the Project. The locations of proposed soil
disturbance and construction along the railroad alignment were also reviewed against the
CDPHE sites. The properties were identified as low or high risk for environmental hazards and
environmental liability. Contamination can occur from past or current operations such as
landfills, maintenance operation yards, industrial operations, automotive service businesses, dry
cleaners, mine and mill sites, and unsanctioned activities.

Findings/Results

The proposed train stations, bridges, and sound wall locations were reviewed to evaluate
potential impacts that would require mitigation. The train stations and most of the proposed
construction areas did not have adjoining properties that were impacted and were found to be
low risk. Along the Project alignment, only two adjoining properties were identified that would
impact the proposed NWR construction, as most of the REC site locations were not adjoining
the Project alignment. A table was prepared that listed the REC properties, previous and current
land use, along with the surveyed station numbers along the Project alignment. Only two
locations within the proposed construction area were identified as high risk and information for
mitigation costs were estimated.
One property northeast of the Broomfield Station, located at 11811 Upham Street (REC site
#1258 – Figure 2), is registered as an active Superfund site by the Environmental Protection
Agency, however, it is not on the National Priorities List, and no further federal action is
required. A partial right-of-way (ROW) take for the Project is shown along the western end of
the site. Although no documentation was found identifying this area as being contaminated, an
estimation of mitigation costs was completed for this portion of the property.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Data Collection/Methodology

Another property, located at 11939 Sugar Mill Road (REC site #21, 24 – Figure 2), 1.5 miles
east of the proposed Longmont Station, is the former Great Western Sugar Company Factory
with 11 buildings and sugar silos, former diesel ASTs and landfill disposal on the property. The
property is in disrepair with buildings crumbling and the sugar silos still intact on over 40 acres.
This area is proposed for future additional transit-oriented development, as part of the NWR
Project. Although no documentation was found identifying this area as being contaminated, it is
an area of concern for future development east of the Project limits. The property is east of the

The Planning and Environmental Study will include a high-level description of potential impacts
and environmental constraints, with further recommendations on how to proceed during
subsequent environmental and design project development steps, as applicable. RTD will
complete a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) during NEPA. Based on the Phase I
ESA findings, if a Phase II ESA (i.e., materials testing) or remediation activities are required,
there may be substantial delays for property acquisition or construction in the vicinity. Also, a
Phase II ESA and remedial activities could require additional funding. These activities are
associated with the acquisition of properties.

Hazardous materials concerns within the construction area will require specifications to guide
contractors regarding safety precautions, protocols, and environmental commitments. A
Materials Management Plan will be used if construction activities are anticipated to encounter
hazardous materials.
Right-of-way acquisitions are not expected along the mainline track alignment and freight siding
alignments for the Base Configuration, as these are assumed to be within BNSF right-of-way
and would be included in an agreement between BNSF and RTD. Station areas may require
some right-of-way acquisition for constructing and operating the rail platforms and ancillary
infrastructure.

The Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (the Study) was part of a continuing collaborative effort
between the Regional Transportation District (RTD), local transportation partners, and
community stakeholders to identify and address mobility solutions for peak period service along
the Northwest Rail alignment, which extends from Denver Union Station to the existing
Westminster Station and extending to Boulder and Longmont. The track alignment is owned by
BNSF Railway who would continue to own the railroad if peak service is implemented.
The Study was part of RTD’s ongoing commitment to the FasTracks plan, which includes
commuter rail service from Denver Union Station to Boulder and terminating in Longmont. The
Study advances the efforts toward this goal.
The Study was completed in five stages
•

Milestone 1: Confirm and refine the Peak Service concept with stakeholders

•

Milestone 2: Identify local, state, federal, and BNSF requirements for the operation of
service (the “Base Configuration”)

•

Milestone 3: Conduct initial planning and develop preliminary engineering design and
costs required to build and operate the Base Configuration service

•

Milestone 4: Identify likely service expansion scenarios to avoid precluding expanded
RTD or FRPRD passenger service

•

Milestone 5: Identify potential project implementation strategies

The Study evaluated the feasibility of providing peak period service for the Northwest Rail. Over
approximately two years, the Study identified the requirements, costs, and operational needs to
upgrade existing track, develop rail stations, and provide peak service to northwestern
metropolitan communities, which include Arvada, Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder,
and Longmont. As part of the feasibility study RTD engaged BNSF to conduct a preliminary
engineering design to define the infrastructure improvements required to integrate commuter
rail service with freight service on the BNSF tracks. The results of the BNSF design work were
incorporated by the Project Team into the Base Configuration.

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Executive Summary

The Study included a public engagement to solicit public feedback regarding the peak service
plan. The Study addressed Milestones 1-3 from Spring 2022 through Spring 2023 with extended
focus on Milestone 3 through Winter 2023 and into early 2024. Milestone 4 took place from Fall
2023 to Spring 2024. The Study concluded with Milestone 5, which was the final Common Set
of Facts and the final summary report.

In addition to the major touchpoints noted above, the Project Team held meetings and
workshops monthly with the Study Advisory Team (SAT). Milestone 1 (Spring 2022-Summer
2022) established an agreed-upon Peak Service Concept that presented the analysis of
alternatives from previous and existing strategic plans, studies and commitments from local
jurisdictional partners. This allowed the Study team to understand potential opportunities or
gaps with station locations, service amenities, etc. along the corridor. The SAT convened for a
Plans & Initial Commitments Workshop to begin discussions on the project and were provided
progress updates via email throughout this milestone.
Milestone 2 began in Summer 2022 and finished in the Fall, focusing on revisiting and
confirming commitments from the study area communities, agencies and other stakeholders,
and integrating them into the Peak Service concept plan. Throughout this milestone, the SAT
gathered three times for update meetings and an Initial Configuration workshop was held. The
Project Team confirmed an initial “footprint” to assess environmental impacts and identify direct
and indirect effects to the adjacent communities, including Environmental Justice (EJ)
populations. The identification of EJ populations was used to assess and avoid potential impacts
and is part of both the planning effort and the equity analysis that is required prior to the siting
of facilities and modification to service under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which
prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that
receive federal financial assistance. These concept plans are location-based and were presented
to the public.
The focus of Milestone 3 (Spring 2023-Winter 2023) was to refine both the operating plan, and
the infrastructure requirements gathered through Milestones 1 and 2 by solicitation and input
from agency partners, technical subject matter experts (SME), and the public. This included
service options and vehicle alternatives. The first public touchpoint took place during this
milestone in January/February 2023 when RTD and local agencies hosted pop-up events, two
public open houses, and a self-guided online meeting. The SAT, in addition to five update
meetings, convened for two in-person workshops to discuss base configuration and explore
partnerships.
Another round of pop-up events, public open houses, and a self-guided online meeting were
hosted in the latter half of 2023 near the end of Milestone 3, where the basic peak period
service requirements, or Base Configuration, was shared with the public. During this period, the
Project Team continued to meet monthly with the SAT to discuss updates on BNSF design and
negotiations, local plan agreements, and public engagement.

the Study. RTD and BNSF worked together to develop a concept for peak service in the
corridor, including service option modeling and engineering design. To provide consistency with
previous work on the corridor, the Study documented the alternatives considered in the past
that led to the Peak Service concept. Elements of this plan were vetted through a stakeholder
engagement process to understand desired community objectives. In addition, the concept
must not preclude any future passenger rail service options that would encompass a larger rail
program along the Front Range.

Milestone Input
Input during this milestone included the analysis of alternatives from previous and existing
strategic plans and studies and understanding of commitments from local jurisdictional partners
to understand potential opportunities or gaps at station locations, service amenities, etc.

Milestone Output
An agreed-upon Peak Service concept to represent to the stakeholders and public.

Milestone 2 – Confirm Partner/Stakeholder Plans and
Commitments

Attachment: MS-3 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Milestone 5 showcased final implementation strategies and next steps. A final summary report
for the Peak Service Concept was made available to the public following a presentation of the
study findings to the RTD Board of Directors.

Goals and Outcomes
Through previous efforts, study area communities, agencies, and stakeholders have developed
plans and committed resources to support progress and implementation of Northwest Rail
Line/B Line service. Elements include secured rights-of-way, infrastructure investments in
station areas, and identified grade crossings in anticipation of NWR implementation.

analysis efforts required under Title IV.
These location-based concept plans were presented to the public. This was the first public
touchpoint in the study.

Milestone 3 – Initial Footprint
Goals and Outcomes
Milestone 3 used input from agency partners, technical subject matter experts, and the public
from Milestones 1 and 2 to refine both the operating plan and the infrastructure requirements,
including any service options and vehicle alternatives.

Milestone Input
Continued to engage SAT, Technical Advisory Committee, and Subject Matter Expert to refine
operating and infrastructure plans. The Study team utilized feedback from previous SAT
workshops, meetings, and the initial public open house to present conceptual site plans and
high-level operating plans during this milestone’s SAT workshop and public open house.

Milestone Output
Refined conceptual site plans based on SAT and public input.

Milestone 3.5 Study Advisory Team Outcomes and Findings
Update Meetings
From Summer 2023 to Winter 2024, the Study team convened with the SAT for seven update
meetings. Throughout the summer months, the SAT reviewed agreements between NWR,
FRPR, and BNSF and assisted the Study team in preparing for a presentation to the RTD Board.
Beginning in the later months of the year, the SAT reviewed BNSF preliminary design work and
plan progression, discussing factors like platforms, vehicle options, rail maintenance facility,
midday layover facility, and environmental justice analysis with the Study team. The SAT also
assisted in open house planning and reviewed the CBO winter engagement plan during this
time. In early 2024, the Study team and the SAT continued to examine public engagement
efforts, in addition to discussing technical matters including station sidings, passing sidings,

plan agreements regarding station-specific improvements.

Milestone 4 – Assess and Refine Preliminary Configuration
Relative to Long-Range Plans
Goals and Outcomes
Public and stakeholder comments in the previous milestones led to the Study team assessing
the addition of a reverse commute trips to the Peak Service concept. The Project Team
developed an operating concept to define a “time block” during the morning and evening peak
periods that RTD would lease from BNSF Railway to run reverse commutes. Milestone 4
considered the implications of using the time block for trips in each direction. The Project Team
also considered the coordination required between the Peak Service plan and a possible
intercity passenger rail. The Study team considered long-range rail service plans, including the
Front Range Passenger Rail (FRPR), how those plans might fit into the Northwest Rail Peak
Service concept, and potential next steps. The RTD Strategic Plan – that serves as the
functional pillars by which RTD plans, develops, evaluates and measures overall performance –
was also assessed for the role that the Peak Service plan would play at the regional transit
level.

Milestone Input
RTD Study Team reviewed other long-range rail plans including the Denver Regional Council of
Government’s (DRCOG) Metro Vision Plan – which guides the region’s investments in the
multimodal transportation system – to evaluate the merits of NWR integration within a larger
program.

Milestone Output
This milestone produced an program of improvements for the Northwest Rail corridor, including
capital and operating costs, and comparisons to peer agencies with similar service. A phased
approach for rail service in this corridor is currently unknown but will be determined based on
funding.

We make lives better
through connections.

The objective of Milestone 4 (MS4) is to consider potential service expansion opportunities for the Base
Configuration for Northwest Rail Peak Service. The Base Configuration is the service plan for commuter rail as
defined by the RTD Board of Directors with input from stakeholders in the Northwest Corridor. RTD identified
several potential service expansion opportunities that could be feasible and meet the needs identified during
the public and stakeholder engagement process.

The Peak Service Base Configuration
The Base Configuration service concept was defined by the RTD Board of Directors and stakeholders as three
morning peak trips from Longmont to Denver and three evening peak trips from Denver to Longmont with six
new stations and with service operating in place of the three trips morning and three evening peak trips on the
existing B Line service. Since the Base Configuration Service Concept would include stops at existing B Line
stations, existing B Line trains would be replaced by Northwest Rail trains operating three trains thirty minutes
apart during each peak period and on a compatible schedule with the overall B Line service.
The Base Configuration was refined in Milestone 3 (MS3) to define the infrastructure required for the service
concept to operate. The Project Team developed the infrastructure requirements based on track
improvements required to achieve a travel time goal of 65 minutes (+/-2 minutes) between Longmont and
Denver Union Station (DUS), including stops and dwell times at intermediate stations. In addition, MS3
defined land and infrastructure requirements for stations, midday storage and maintenance and storage facility
requirements, freight passing sidings required by BNSF, and safety, signals, communications, and crossing
improvements required to operate commuter rail on a freight rail line. The Project Team identified a midday
storage facility north of Westminster/72nd Station, enabling the Northwest Rail peak service trains to replace
the full roundtrips of existing B Line trains between Westminster/72nd and DUS during peak periods while
avoiding additional conflicts into and out of Union Station.
In addition to service and infrastructure requirements, MS3 identified the design considerations under which
RTD would acquire an easement from BNSF for the exclusive operations of commuter rail service during peak
hours without potential conflicts with freight rail operations. BNSF has developed a standard format of multiple
agreements through which it partners with regional transit agencies who provide commuter rail service on
BNSF tracks. The Project Team considered the potential costs and cost effectiveness of operating additional
service within time blocks that would be acquired from BNSF to operate the peak service versus additional
service that would require negotiating and acquiring additional time blocks from BNSF.

a three-hour time block to allow for any non-revenue movements to occur and to allow for a modest
expansion of service.

Access Easement “Time Block” Concept

Source: RTD; HDR; June 2024

Factors Considered for Expanded Service
In evaluating options for expanded service, the Project Team considered what the community and
stakeholders said in the engagement process, the potential for intercity rail service by Front Range Passenger
Rail (FRPR) to complement peak service, and the potential cost and cost effectiveness of options for expanded
service. The Project Team also considered that US 36 Flatiron Flyer service and the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit
service would provide parallel service to most communities and stations along the Northwest Rail corridor
during congested peak periods as service during less-congested weekday off-peak periods and on weekends
when Northwest Rail Peak Service is not operating.

Community Feedback
The Project Team led an extensive public and stakeholder engagement process that informed the development
of the Base Configuration on a full range of service and infrastructure issues, as well as impacts and benefits
of the service. Public meeting and online participants were also asked, “How can Peak Service be enhanced to
better meet your needs and expectations?” Nearly 300 participants responded, and the summary of responses
to this question are shown in Table 1.

The addition of weekend service was the most desired service enhancement, followed by reverse commute
service during peak periods. Assuming that RTD Northwest Rail Peak Service and FRPR Intercity Rail Service
both operated in the corridor, the Project Team identified in Table 1 the service types that would likely meet
the needs desired by potential users.
Any RTD service operated outside the weekday peak windows identified would require one or more additional
easements with BNSF and would be more likely to interfere with both freight and intercity rail service.
Therefore, expansion alternatives focused on providing one or two reverse commute trains during the threehour time blocks in each peak period. Train operations modeling is required to identify exactly where the
inbound and outbound trains would meet to provide a passenger siding track.

Expanded Service Options

Consistent with other freight corridors that host both commuter and intercity passenger rail service, weekend,
midday, and evening service are often provided by the intercity rail service, while peak period service is
primarily provided by commuter rail. For that reason, and because any additional reverse direction peak
period commuter rail service would operate within the existing peak period times, the Project Team focused its
Expanded Service Options on meeting the need for reverse commute trips.
Up to two trains could operate in the reverse peak direction within the two three-hour easement periods RTD
would acquire from BNSF. This would permit each peak period to provide up to two round trips and one oneway trip. The Project Team evaluated two alternatives: Expansion Alternative One with one peak round trip
and two one-way trips, and Expansion Alternative Two with two peak round trips and one one-way trip. The
two expanded service options shown in Table 2 build modestly on the Base Configuration.

Expansion Alternative 1 extends one of the reverse commute trains from Westminster/72nd Station to
Longmont and eliminates the need for midday storage of one train. This train may remain in the Longmont
Station during the day, or it may return to the Northwest Rail Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (RMF)
before making its evening peak round trip from Longmont to Denver and back. To allow for both peak
direction and reverse commute trains to operate, a passenger passing track would need to be constructed
south of Broomfield/116th Station (this passing track would serve both Expansion Alternatives 1 and 2).
Expansion Alternatives 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 3.
Expansion Alternative 2 extends two of the reverse commute trains from Westminster/72nd Station to
Longmont and eliminates the need for midday storage of two trains. Trains would remain at the Longmont
Station during the day before returning to make two evening peak round trips from Longmont to Denver and
back. This option would eliminate the need to expand existing storage tracks at Westminster/72nd Station,
since the existing storage tracks have the capacity to store one Northwest Rail Peak Service Train and leave a
turnaround track for the B Line electric trains.

Analysis of Conceptual Service Expansion
Alternatives
The technical analysis of possible expansion options was conducted using a train operations software model
called Rail Traffic Controller (RTC). Train operations in the model were simulated on an infrastructure
configuration based on the track layout and geometry of BNSF’s Front Range Subdivision from Longmont,
through Boulder that leads to a connection with the RTD B Line north of the Westminster – 72nd Street
Station. From there, the model track infrastructure follows RTD’s B Line from Westminster Station at 72nd
Street to Denver Union Station.

Attachment: MS-4 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Additional train modeling, coupled with a bus schedule analysis, would be required to determine whether train
schedules would meet typical commute schedules for employment destinations along the corridor. Providing
an earlier departure from Denver to Longmont may be possible if a train can be stored overnight at Denver
Union Station; however, both security and capacity concerns would need to be assessed.

RTD established a travel time goal from Longmont to Union Station of 65 minutes plus/minus 2 minutes. The
planned train speeds along the route were then established by RTD and previous rail simulation modeling was
performed to develop the run-time.
Plans for the existing rail infrastructure and the added improvements in the Base Configuration were provided
to the modeling team to build the line’s track infrastructure into the RTC model. The most recently developed

30% preliminary engineering level plans prepared by BNSF Railway for implementing the RTD Northwest Rail
commuter service were used.

•

Locations and track work associated with new commuter rail stations along the BNSF Front Range
Subdivision

•

Locations and track work providing access to a Northwest Rail commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(RMF) in Longmont

•

Locations and track work providing access to a RTD NWR Midday Layover facility at the Westminster
Station

•

Locations and track configurations for all three of the proposed new passing sidings along the BNSF
Front Range Subdivision to support the implementation of Northwest Rail commuter service

•

Location and track configuration of connecting track at Westminster Station between the BNSF Front
Range Subdivision and the RTD B Line to be used by Northwest Rail commuter trains

•

No signal-controlled sections were assumed in the model

The next steps began with building train files to simulate the movement of the proposed RTD Northwest Rail
commuter trains in the model under the Base Configuration plan of three one-way weekday morning trips from
Longmont to Union Station and three one-way weekday evening trips from Union Station to Longmont. Train
files include a schedule for the train’s trip, the equipment to be used, and associated characteristics (e.g., train
length, train weight). The technical report “RTD Northwest Rail Peak Service Study Vehicle, Travel Time &
Operating Plan Support Task 4 – Simulation Results for Greenbox & Westminster Options”; Hatch/LTK; April
17, 2023, was used to integrate the B Line operating plan and schedule from Westminster Station to and from
Union Station.
This plan support work also included the G Line operations along the two-track segment from Pecos Junction
to Union Station which is another component in the overall operating plan. The current B Line and G Line
weekday train schedules were used with the Base Configuration service plan.
The Base Configuration proposes to replace six peak period B Line round trips operated by Denver Transit
Operators (DTO) to preserve capacity at DUS platforms. With this replacement, no additional impacts to
existing services would be incurred from the proposed Service Expansion Alternatives.

Attachment: MS-4 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Components built into the model specifically for the Peak Service commuter rail project included:

Nonrevenue train movement information was used detailing the proposed nonrevenue movement of Northwest
Rail trainsets to and from storage/maintenance facilities. It was also necessary to build train files to simulate
the movement of scheduled weekday RTD G Line and B Line commuter trains between Pecos Junction and
Union Station in the model to harmonize Northwest Rail train operations with RTD commuter train operations

Milestone 4 – Peak Service Expansion Concepts Technical Report

The output was train schedules for Northwest Rail, B Line, and G Line (to and from Denver-Pecos Junction
only) commuter trains. A train performance chart was output to show the operating profile for the commuter
train. A third product was output of stringline diagrams depicting one typical weekday of Northwest Rail
commuter, B Line, and G Line train operations along the Northwest Rail Line route.
The modeling team analyzed the following alternatives for adding service in two different service types:
•

Base Configuration Commuter Rail by RTD
o The Base Configuration requested by the RTD Board of Directors is the primary model run. It is
composed of the three inbound peak runs in the morning and three outbound runs in the
evening.
o Expansion Alternative 1 is built from the Base Configuration but includes a reverse peak service
run within the morning and evening “time block” windows allotted for Northwest Rail commuter
trains on the BNSF Front Range Subdivision. The first train in each peak is the train that runs
the reverse service.
o Expansion Alternative 2 is the same as the previous two alternatives, but a second reverse peak
service run was added to the time block window. In this case, the two earliest runs are those
that reverse.

•

In any model run, no freight trains were assumed to be in the segment. If freight trains happened to
be in the segment, BNSF dispatch would shunt the freight train(s) into one of the three new passing
sidings.

Additional assumptions for the conceptual analysis included:

8

•

New Northwest Rail commuter trains would make the same station stops and have the same trip times
as Base Configuration service Northwest Rail trains

•

New Northwest Rail commuter trains were planned to operate in conformance with the established
service patterns of existing B Line between Westminster and DUS

•

New frequencies were planned that utilize the three trainsets proposed for the Northwest Rail base
commuter service; no additional equipment should be required to implement the additional reverse
commute service.

•

For both Expansion Alternatives, the first train (Expansion Alternatives 1 and 2) or first two trains
(Expansion Alternative 2) in each peak were assumed to provide the reverse commute service. The
return time for these trains would coincide with the start of day/end of day in the Boulder and
Longmont areas.

Equipment characteristics for the B Line and G Line commuter trains was used from RTD data for the current
Hyundai-Rotem fleet (vehicle type, number of cars, train length, train weight). For the Peak Service commuter
rail service, Stadler DMU vehicles in three-car trainsets were used in this analysis.

•

If the reverse commute operations were implemented, the first inbound and first outbound trains
would meet in the segment between the 116th/Broomfield and Downtown Westminster stations near a
BNSF Milepost labeled “Homestead”. The second reverse commute in Expansion Alternative 2 would
meet the last peak service train in the approximately six-mile B Line section between Union Station and
Westminster. This is a double-track section so no layover in a siding would be needed for either
direction.

•

Minimum equipment-turn times of 11 minutes at Union Station and 20 minutes at the Longmont
endpoint stations were assumed.

Run-time, Train Performance, and Stringline
Results
Run-time tables using Excel were prepared for the Base Configuration and the two expansion alternative
operating plans. The RTC model produced a train performance profile for Base Configuration as illustrated in
Figure 5 and Figure 6 for Northbound (outbound) and Southbound (inbound) trips respectively. Dwell times
and track speeds from the previous model runs by RTD were used in the simulation.
The run-time tables are presented in the Appendix followed by the associated stringline diagrams. The runtime tables show the departure times for each station, and the arrival time at the Westminster Station mid-day
layover location. The reverse commute trains show the run-time for returning to Longmont as well.
The simulation provides output of train track-miles and train-hours for use in estimating operating and
maintenance costs. Those calculations are provided at the bottom of each run-time table. The tables also have
listed trains by letter (A, B, C) or by departure time (e.g. SB-0550). In all three of the simulations for
commuter rail, the service can be provided by three operating train sets, so no additional equipment is needed
for any of the expansion commuter rail alternatives.

Milestone 4 – Peak Service Expansion Concepts Technical Report
Observations of the run-times and the stringlines are summarized following:
Commuter Rail Base Configuration

o The base configuration operation is for 3 consecutive train runs from Longmont to DUS
designed such that the train schedules on the RTD controlled segment between the existing
Westminster Station and DUS would be the same as the current B-Line schedule. The timing of
the Longmont to Westminster Station commuter rail trip is set to meet the established B Line
schedules to complete the run to DUS.
•

Commuter Rail Expansion Alternative 1
o Alternative 1 includes one reverse train in the AM and PM time blocks.
o The first morning southbound train, Train A, is the train that reverses to reach Boulder at 8:00
AM and Longmont at 8:15 AM
o This schedule results in one additional train-meet of the northbound train, northbound Train A
with the third southbound train, Train C at the segment between Downtown Westminster and
116th/Broomfield Stations. The meeting could be timed to occur at the 116th/Broomfield station
and that section built with a double track segment for the passenger trains.
o Because the reverse commute used the first morning train “A” equipment, it arrives in
Longmont at 8:15. The total window of morning commuter rail operations on the BNSF freight
line would be slightly more than two and a half hours, during which time freight trains would
either not be scheduled to operate within the NWR segment or would be held in a siding.
o The morning and the afternoon Peak Service Base Configuration schedules could be run in a
three-hour block of time to allow for any variability setting the basis for the Access Easement
from BNSF Railway

•

Commuter Rail Expansion Alternative 2
o In this alternative the first northbound train, Train A, and the third southbound train, Train C
meet at the same point as Expansion Alternative 1 between Downtown Westminster and
116th/Broomfield.
o The second northbound train, “B” would not have a meet with southbound trains and would not
require any additional infrastructure than would be required in Alternative 1.

Attachment: MS-4 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

•

o In the sketch plan-level train modeling, this operating pattern is shown to take up just over
three full hours for the morning and afternoon peak periods. Refinement of the run times, dwell
times and other assumptions in the model can tighten up the operating window in future
planning work.

o Expansion Alternative 2: $20 M - $22 M

Operations and Dispatch Coordination
The PTC technology in use by RTD and BNSF will require a concept of operations implementation plan. For the
Northwest Rail commuter rail trains, the PTC and voice communication system for inbound trains will need to
transition from BNSF territory to the RTD territory. Similarly, the PTC and voice communication system for
outbound trains will need to transition from RTD to the BNSF territory.
Both the respective RTD and BNSF PTC systems will need to be installed in parallel and potentially activated
simultaneously in each territory. The overlap area shown in Figure 7 would be a transition area that must be
implemented for continuous PTC coverage. The details and implementation of this transition area will be
dependent on who is selected to operate the railroad, i.e., RTD, a third-party contractor or BNSF. The PTC
transition area is at the end of RTD track and beginning of a staging or transition area at the Westminster–
72nd Station Tail Track.

Capital costs and operating and maintenance (OPEX) estimates were calculated using the stringline diagrams
as inputs. The O&M costs are expressed as a range from the least amount of service in the Base Configuration

PTC and Dispatch Transition Area

Source: HDR; April 2024 Done

Because commuter rail would run only during the peak periods, those time blocks provide clear delineation of
which party is responsible for the dispatch and control requirements. When defining the Peak Service concept
of operations, it will be important to not preclude consideration of midday, evening and weekend RTD and/or
intercity service.

Conclusions
The Base Configuration would need to add a new commuter rail siding to allow up to two reverse commute
peak period train trips to operate within the proposed time block acquired from BNSF. Infrastructure changes
include a passenger passing track south of Broomfield/116th Station and a possible reduction or elimination of
required improvements for the midday train storage area at Westminster/72nd.
Initial sketch planning suggests that up to two round trips can be operated within the 3-hour time block that
would be acquired from BNSF. This would allow three peak period, peak direction trains and two peak period,
reverse peak trains to operate each peak period. Moreover, the added service can be operated with the same
fleet that operates peak direction trains; thus, no additional trains would need to be acquired.

A more detailed analysis of train operations, including detailed modeling, is required to validate findings.

Milestone 5 outlines the steps that RTD would need to move the Peak Service plan forward. Project delivery
considerations and implementation strategies use the Base Configuration that embodies the initial service plan
for commuter rail as requested by the RTD Board of Directors.
There are several basic considerations relative to implementation of the Base Configuration for commuter
service across the Northwest Rail corridor consisting of:
•

Developing an overall long-term rail service strategy for the corridor that includes freight and
passenger services

•

Establishing a business relationship with BNSF Railway (BNSF) to utilize and share the trackway

•

Understanding the costs and potential funding opportunities

•

Outlining implementation opportunities for RTD to consider

This Technical Report is organized into the following sections:
•

Service Implementation Strategy

•

BNSF Agreements and Associated Costs

•

Capital and O&M Costs

•

Funding Opportunities

•

Implementation Opportunities

Service Implementation Strategy
The Peak Service plan would introduce commuter rail passenger service into a key segment of the BNSF Front
Range Subdivision for the first time in more than 60 years. During that time, freight operations have evolved
to use more technology to support safe and efficient operations that could allow joint operations with
passenger trains. However, as economic, business, and regulatory policy conditions continue to change, BNSF
must consider these types of factors to remain profitable.

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Introduction

Returning passenger trains to the Northwest Rail corridor could help BNSF to increase usage of the railway
asset to generate revenue. The current freight service is reported to be four to five trains per day, which
leaves substantial room in the operating schedule to add trains to increase revenues. An overall service
implementation strategy should be developed that would set out the requirements and the responsibilities of
the entities that would operate trains on the alignment.

•

Service - set goals and objectives for freight and passenger service to be jointly operated safely and
efficiently

•

Operations – develop plans to separate passenger and freight trains by time and space

•

Infrastructure – plan, design, build, and use freight sidings and control/communication systems to
separate by time

These components will probably change over time as the services are added or changed. An iterative process
should be used that shares the long-term objectives of each entity. To achieve the long-term goals and
objectives, incremental steps in the near-term and mid-term should be defined among the entities. Such an
approach is represented in Figure 1. This approach was used recently to assist the BNSF, North County Transit
District (commuter rail operator in San Diego County, California) and Amtrak to create the strategy for the
Oceanside to San Diego portion of the Los Angeles – San Diego (LOSSAN) Corridor.

Implementation Strategy: Service Level Objectives

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

A service implementation strategy would be composed of three parts:

As a first step for commuter rail in the Northwest Corridor, general operating plans for the Near-Term have
been defined by RTD as the Peak Service Base Configuration. BNSF is studying the infrastructure requirements
for this initial step. It is also important to outline an overall “strategic goal” for both parties in the long-term
and iteratively work back to the Near-Term for implementation as depicted in Figure 1. A strategic goal for
RTD is to fulfill the commitments in the FasTracks Plan. A strategic goal for BNSF could be to increase usage
of the tracks to generate revenue. And finally, a future strategic goal could be to incorporate an intercity
passenger service plan such as the Front Range Passenger Rail proposal.

The Peak Service Feasibility Study (the Study) outlines the commuter rail operating plans which now must be
compared to the freight operations. Windows of track time or blocks of time have been defined in the Study
where RTD could operate commuter service. Figure 2 illustrates the blocks of time concept in yellow bands for
the AM and PM peak periods. In order to implement the Peak Service Schedule, RTD would need to acquire
the right to operate during these blocks while BNSF freight traffic was idled or scheduled to operate outside
these windows.
BNSF must now consider the initial introduction of commuter service in the Northwest segment of the Front
Range Subdivision with their current and future freight operations. The two operating plans must be merged,
evaluated and fine-tuned to produce a “management plan” that would serve as the basis for partnership
agreements.

Implementation Strategy: Trackway Infrastructure Needs
For more than 15 years, RTD and BNSF have been coordinating planning studies to define the trackway
infrastructure needs for the joint operation of freight and commuter rail service in the corridor. The most
recent efforts consist of the Study by RTD and the corresponding preliminary engineering design work by
BNSF and their engineering contractor, Wilson & Company.

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Implementation Strategy: Time Separated Operating Plans

The result is definition of the Base Configuration that would support the Peak Service plan. BNSF prepared
plan drawings and a cost estimate at the 30% design level for the trackway infrastructure improvements.
These improvements were based on train operation simulations modeled by BNSF that called for freight
sidings at different points in the corridor into which they could shunt freight trains while the commuter rail
trains were operating.

Milestone 5 – Project Delivery and Implementation Concepts
Technical Report

B.1.g

The information generated through these studies and design plans provide a “common set of facts” from
which the RTD Board of Directors (Board) could make a determination regarding implementation. If that
determination is made, the overall Implementation Strategy to address the service types, the operations of
those services and required infrastructure will need to be developed.
Once RTD and BNSF agree to the Implementation Strategy parameters, the two parties will reach initial
alignment with regards to the respective interim and long-term service plans. These corridor plans will support
the refinement of regional plans to define the service and infrastructure investment milestones. Following the
Implementation Strategy agreement, the next step is to negotiate the formal partnership agreements that
must be executed between BNSF and RTD to move forward with implementing the Peak Period Service Plan.

BNSF Agreements and Associated Costs
Joint use of the BNSF trackway along the Front Range Subdivision is the only path for RTD to operate a
commuter rail service in this corridor. A partnership between RTD and BNSF is needed to implement the
commuter rail service. This partnership will require a foundation built on shared goals and outcomes defined
by the two entities. For example, a key goal and outcome will be building and operating a commuter rail
service at the same time a freight rail service is running. This goal must focus on safety and security of both
operations. Another goal may be to limit impacts to existing and future land uses while increasing usage of
the tracks. BNSF could have an objective related to increasing the use of the trackway asset to generate new
revenues.
The Study defined the Base Configuration to meet the service implementation strategy objectives by:
•

Defining both the commuter rail and the freight service plan objectives

•

Planning for near-term service to not preclude possible mid-term and long-range operations

•

Identification of the additional infrastructure needed for successful commuter rail and freight service

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

The resulting plans identified three sidings totaling more than 8.2 miles of siding tracks. The BNSF design also
included the station sidings for all six stations along with the necessary drainage, structures, signaling,
roadway crossings, communications, and ancillary improvements within the trackway envelope. These
improvements would be designed and built by BNSF. All features outside the right-of-way such as station
platforms and passenger areas would be designed and built by RTD.

The RTD/BNSF relationship will require a legal and financial basis to go forward. For other commuter rail
systems, BNSF has used a straightforward series of steps that lead to the formal agreements, defining the
initial access and capital costs and subsequent transactions as well as the on-going operating and maintenance
framework. These steps consist of:
1. Access easement
2. Capital improvements to the BNSF infrastructure that enable joint commuter rail and freight rail service.
4

Milestone 5 – Project Delivery and Implementation Concepts
Technical Report

B.1.g

3. Non-BNSF capital costs for stations and similar commuter rail related infrastructure
4. Trackway and other on-going asset maintenance.

6. Other operating costs, both mandatory and optional

Access Easement
RTD will need to acquire an interest in the existing BNSF Front Range Subdivision with a one-time payment for
an easement in the real property. BNSF will define a value of the easement that would accommodate RTD’s
peak service operations. The cost of the access easement would be prorated based on the number of hours
RTD intends to use the BNSF infrastructure or based on the proportional share of the RTD passenger trips as a
percent of total train (commuter and freight rail) trips. It is important to note that RTD’s acquisition of the
Access Easement will need to be done pursuant to all requirements of the Federal Uniform Relocation
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 as amended.
For the purposes of this analysis, the estimated cost for an easement to utilize the Front Range Subdivision
was derived from limited sources, primarily the access easement that the Twin Cities Metro transit agency
negotiated with BNSF Railway. In that case the ROW width was assumed to be 100 feet. An alternative for the
NWR alignment would be the width of the trackway envelope of 37.5 feet. These two dimensions are used to
develop a range of acquisition costs. Examples of alternate methods to cover these costs are presented in the
Costs Summary Technical Report for the Peak Service plan.

BNSF Capital Improvements
Capital improvements are the RTD share of infrastructure improvements BNSF will implement to accommodate
both freight and commuter rail services. As listed above, these will include tracks, positive train control (PTC),
pedestrian tunnels, and other improvements to support commuter rail service to address RTD specifications.
These improvements would reflect an initial capital expense but would also be subject to asset maintenance
requirements including ongoing track replacement and replacement of PTC, switches, technology, etc. at the
end of the respective lifecycles.
For the Peak Service project, the improvements will include freight passing sidings and passenger station
sidings and track improvements that will enable RTD to provide speed and travel time expectations. Nearly all
track improvements are expected to be charged to RTD, since BNSF would not be making the improvements
“but for the implementation of commuter rail service”.

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

5. Mandatory operating costs

Track and Other Asset Maintenance
Maintenance of Way (MOW) costs will be defined in an agreement and will reflect a calculated allocation of
train miles and weight (ton-miles) to apportion the share of maintenance between BNSF and RTD. This will be
an ongoing payment from the RTD that is likely subject to annual inflation or Consumer Price Index (CPI)
adjustments. The allocation approach will likely leave RTD with a smaller portion of track maintenance costs
because of less annual ton-miles over the segment compared to BNSF. One unique consideration is that RTD’s
5

Technical Report

B.1.g

A key issue will be how to structure funding responsibility for asset maintenance activities to address State of
Good Repair (SOGR) objectives or replacement of the various assets at the end of their useful lives in 20 or 30
years. While the “but for” test will put funding onus on RTD for the initial improvements, both RTD and BNSF
will benefit from the new infrastructure going forward. The SOGR or replacement cost allocation approach
should be negotiated at the time of the initial agreement. An important component of the cost allocation
approach will be an asset depreciation schedule to establish parameters for each entity.
Finally, infrastructure refurbishment for commuter rail are likely to be charged at the time of replacement
rather than with an ongoing use fee. One approach in the agreements would be to consider asset replacement
to be included in the capital improvement category above and included in the asset depreciation schedule. The
method of cost/use allocation would be computed in train miles in the corridor or the cumulative weight of
train cars. Passenger trains will be hundreds of feet in length as either three DMU vehicles coupled together or
with two to five coaches and a locomotive. Freight trains can be thousands of feet long with hundreds of cars
and multiple locomotives.

Mandatory Operational Costs
Specific operational costs that RTD must pay to BNSF will primarily be train dispatching and passenger
operations management from BNSF’s Ft. Worth Headquarters. RTD will also likely be responsible for a BNSF
Passenger Operations Superintendent for the Northwest Rail portion of the Front Range Subdivision. In
addition, RTD will be responsible for PTC operation along the corridor, and any handover operation that occurs
between RTD territory and BNSF’s Front Range Subdivision. This will be an ongoing operating cost and
associated payment, subject to inflation or CPI adjustments.
It will be important to develop a cost model to specify how these direct costs will be calculated. Because the
BNSF Front Range subdivision stretches for more than 100 miles, RTD would negotiate its share of the
subdivision dispatch desk in Fort Worth for less than 39 miles of the Northwest Rail line.
Other expenses such as operation and maintenance responsibility of at-grade crossing equipment is a sensitive
issue. The O&M costs at roadway crossings can be allocated among the local jurisdictions and the commuter
and freight rail services based on reasonable allocation models.

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

addition of station sidings and switches will likely create an additional factor in track maintenance costs that
may be less common in commuter rail systems that lack level platform boarding. Further, RTD will probably be
charged 100% for PTC maintenance, unless the cost can be allocated jointly to RTD and a second passenger
rail service.

Optional Operational Costs
RTD will be required to pay for the commuter train operations and maintenance. RTD has two options for
operations:

•

RTD would directly operate the commuter rail service as they do now on the N Line; or,

•

RTD would contract with an operator to provide the service as they do now with the A, B and G Lines.

B.1.g

Non-BNSF Capital Improvements (by RTD)
BNSF will not construct stations and other commuter rail infrastructure; therefore, these RTD-specific costs will
be in addition to the previously described BNSF capital costs. RTD will have shared infrastructure with local
municipalities at certain stations. A standard RTD policy for FasTracks projects is to obtain a cost participation
contribution from the local jurisdiction that constitutes 2.5% of the overall cost of the infrastructure
improvements.
Additionally, RTD may be required to maintain certain crossing improvements required by the Colorado Public
Utilities Commission unless these costs are allocated to a local jurisdiction. RTD as the commuter rail program
implementer will be responsible for all capital, maintenance, and operating costs of station infrastructure,
some of which may be contributed from other sources such as the 2.5% local jurisdiction participation. In the
situation where FRPRD shares a station, costs would be allocated based on some reasonable measure.

Potential Costs Associated with BNSF Agreements
RTD will need to negotiate the capital and operating and maintenance (OPEX) costs that will be assigned to
the Peak Service commuter rail service by BNSF to operate within the BNSF Front Range Subdivision Corridor.
The negotiations will include the use of some basis to apportion the costs between the commuter operations
and the freight operations. These can vary from using a “time” basis or using a “train-event” basis. In the
“time” basis, the entities that share the track would calculate the proportionate share of time throughout the
“day” during which each would be operating. The “train-event” basis would follow the number of trains in a
day for each entity. The basis could be as simple as trains per day or could consider the proportionate amount
of wear-and-tear related to the weight of each train across the segment.
A source that outlines and documents the expected costs that RTD would incur is not publicly available.
Therefore, previous agreements between BNSF and other commuter rail systems were used to indicate
possible costs.

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

For any operator, there will be a need for a handoff between RTD and BNSF train operators at
Westminster/72nd Station. For any outside contractor serving as the commuter service operator, RTD would be
responsible for the negotiated contract terms, if performed by BNSF or qualified third party for RTD. Similarly,
the operating costs would be an ongoing internalized expense if RTD operates the service. There are multiple
variables to consider in making a decision about the operating approach.

As an example, the Joint Use Agreement between BNSF and the Metropolitan Council in the Twin Cities
(MN) for the NorthStar commuter rail (Exhibit E of the Joint Use agreement) documents the agreed upon cost
to implement the commuter service. For the purposes of this study, these costs were inflated to provide a
general idea of the potential costs that RTD would incur for the Peak Service plan. The costs are allocated
based on a series of methods not stated in the agreement, so they were made using standard industry means
to allocate responsibilities among parties.

CAPEX Costs
As noted earlier, there are two categories of rail infrastructure capital costs:
•

BNSF Capital Investments: Cost estimates for the trackway portion of the infrastructure improvements
were developed based on 30% preliminary engineering design plans provided by BNSF

•

Non-BNSF Capital Investments: RTD developed the non-BNSF capital costs for stations and other
commuter rail related infrastructure, including the Maintenance Facility and Professional Services

Optional Operating Costs
Although RTD intends to operate the trains for Peak Service, RTD could outsource the commuter rail
operations to a third party. BNSF operates commuter service in other cities such as Seattle. It is estimated that
a contract like that would be in the range of $16-$18 M annually. This compares to the estimated OPEX cost in
the range of $12-14 M annually if RTD were to self-perform train operations.

Peak Service with Additional Operations
The Milestone 4 assessment of possible service expansion identified one or two reverse commute trips that
could be operated within time block windows in both the morning and evening peak periods. Adding the
reverse commute runs would require more operating expenses annually and would require an additional
passing siding and associated infrastructure for the commuter trains. Additional vehicles would not be needed
for the reverse trips.
The commuter rail reverse commute trips could be made within the three-hour time block so technically could
be covered by the access easement terms. That point will be subject to the negotiations with BNSF since the
initiation of the Peak Service study was based on the three trips in the same direction for each peak period. If
the reverse trip(s) are permitted, a new commuter rail passing siding would be needed and the annual
operating costs such as the Mandatory Operating Costs and the MOW Costs would increase along with the
RTD service O&M costs.

A key component of any future funding strategy is pursuing federal grant programs that were expanded or
created in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL includes $102 billion in new federal funding
for transportation projects. Of this, $66 billion is dedicated to rail infrastructure.
Table 3 compares the federal funding categories available for commuter rail such as the Peak Service plan and
the intercity passenger rail such as the FRPR plan. The combination of the two programs would be attractive in
the competitive grant programs because of the wider range of benefits that would result from the federal
dollars.
These grant opportunities could be pursued for individual investment categories or a bundle of multiple
investment categories. Table 4 provides additional information for each of these opportunities and Appendix A
provides detailed descriptions and examples of similar projects from around the country that have received
grant funding. Finally, the FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) Program could provide federal funding for all
infrastructure investment categories. However, the Peak Service project would not qualify for the CIG funds
because the criteria are highly dependent on ridership estimates compared to the total capital costs. With low
ridership and high costs, the Peak Service project would not qualify for this type of federal funding.

Milestone 5 – Project Delivery and Implementation Concepts
Technical Report

B.1.g

Over the almost 20 years following approval of the FasTracks program, RTD has studied the requirements
several times for implementing commuter rail service in the Northwest corridor. The key findings in previous
studies and in this Peak Service Study are that costs are high compared to the level of benefits primarily low
ridership levels that would be served.
The question of affordability comes up each time RTD studies the project. Findings from each study indicate
that actions to improve affordability could increase the chances for implementation.
Implementation of the Peak Service plan requires the following considerations:
•

Assessment of affordability options

•

Acquiring new sources of funds

•

Forming partnerships

Affordability Options
Affordability options that RTD may consider consist of phasing improvements and/or outsourcing certain
functions. As general approaches to implementation, these options would require significant study and analysis
to be included in an implementation strategy.
The phasing of improvements is dependent on the agreement that would be negotiated with the BNSF. If
agreeable with the BNSF, portions of the Base Configuration infrastructure could be phased out over a period
of years, lessening the demand on RTD for capital payments.
Phasing of improvements could consider several approaches which would reflect:
•

Deferring one or more stations from the initial construction until a future point in time may be timed
with land development and/or ridership demands

•

More detailed modeling of train operations may indicate that one or more freight sidings could be built
in a later phase

Attachment: MS-5 Report (5000 : Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study Update)

Implementation Opportunities

One advantage of phasing would be to coordinate the type of improvement with the opportunity to receive
federal funding grants to make that improvement. As shown previously in Table 3, there are several categories
of federal funding that could be aligned with the components of the Base Configuration over a period of
several years.
RTD could also consider outsourcing some of the capital improvements and/or operating functions to a third
party. This option would reduce the initial/one-time capital expense in return for an additional annual
operating expense. For either option, RTD could better align cash flow requirements for Peak Service with
available or anticipated revenues.

Table 5 presents different options that could be achieved depending on the alignment of required capital
and/or operating expenses across the timespan for implementation.

Option for Implementation
Implement incrementally to be more affordable over
time.
Align with funding partners – BIL grant programs
cover many NWR elements
Outsource certain elements to save capital costs, shift
to annual O&M costs
Forge partnerships with the State, FRPRD and BNSF
to share costs and responsibilities

Change in Affordability
CAPEX savings could be possible if improvements can
be phased in agreements with BNSF
Jointly pursue grant funds with BNSF, FRPRD, State
and local agencies
Shifting to OPEX could reduce CAPEX but significantly
increase OPEX
Cost sharing could leverage RTD FISA funds through
bonding.

New Sources of Funds
As detailed in the previous section, RTD could develop a coordinated program of matching the infrastructure
improvements needed with the availability of federal or other funds. Table 6 illustrates the potential
opportunities and level of federal funding that could be targeted for the conceptual incremental investment
categories.

Forming Partnerships

Local agencies already have been working with RTD by planning for development and making infrastructure
improvements anticipating the transit access. In each of the commuter rail stations in the Base Configuration,
local jurisdictions have established guidelines and development requirements to result in Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) that will be supportive of the commuter rail service.
Jurisdictions have also made capital improvements such as linkages to future station sites and continued
improvement of the at-grade rail crossings along the corridor. Further, an existing RTD policy requires at least
a 2.5% infrastructure cost participation by local cities that will further the partnership with local entities.
In the 2024 Colorado legislative session, there was significant work done to define how the state might help
with rail transit funding. Options that would include additional funding for RTD could provide further
connection to the state with the FasTrack programs. Work in future years may bring this concept to fruition.
One of the requirements of the various federal funding sources is that the local agency (in this case RTD) and
the host railroad (BSNF) would need to cooperatively prepare the grant request and then implement the award
together. Coupled with the other business agreements described previously, RTD and BNSF would form a sort
of “working partnership” that would enhance implementation.
Finally, several entities including RTD are presently engaged in defining the ways in which the FRPR concept
could be implemented. The preferred route of the FRPR north segment adopted by that Board is along the
BSNF Front Range Subdivision between Fort Collins and Union Station. A portion of this alignment is the same
segment over which the Peak Service would operate between Longmont and DUS. Sharing implementation
responsibilities between the two programs in partnership with BNSF Railway is a key opportunity for these rail
programs.
There are several opportunities in which the two programs could benefit from shared economies of scale that
include:
•

Probable joint operational efficiencies, especially with regard to the requirements of BNSF as the host
railroad

•

Potential synergies arising from a common fleet type where spare vehicles could be shared reducing
overall fleet costs; sharing portions of a common fleet could save a trainset for RTD which would
reduce costs in the range of $15-20 M

•

Possibility to share and reduce operations and maintenance costs with a shared maintenance facility or
perhaps outsourcing the O&M tasks; with a shared RMF, RTD could save in the range of $40-45 M for
half of that facility cost

•

Potential to share track improvement costs that benefit both entities

Appendix 1-15

rtd-denver.com

RTD could enlist new partners to help with implementation. Sharing roles, responsibilities and costs could
provide added leverage to the ability to implement Peak Service.

•

Potential to share station CAPEX and OPEX expenses at the common stations in Boulder and Longmont

•

Potential to share in costs of safety systems like PTC/communications and crossing upgrades

•

Potential to submit stronger grant requests to state and federal programs to more effectively use
awarded funds

Figure 3 illustrates the two processes and the current stage for the Peak Service Plan and the FRPR program.
The two projects are in the “Corridor and Subarea Planning” stage that would be followed by Programming
Funding and then Project Development for preliminary engineering and environmental clearance. The
environmental studies would be subject to the RTD FasTracks Environmental Resource Guidance (FERG) that
is based on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Regardless of funding source, the Peak Service plan
would fall under these requirements because of the various features that interface with resources and facilities
in which federal, state and local governments have an interest in protecting and/or mitigating impacts with
implementation of either project.

While the purpose of the Study was to identify the facts associated with an RTD peak service operations, the
Project Team identified a potential opportunity for RTD and FRPR to coordinate efforts for a rail solution in the
Northwest area. Consistent with the FasTracks plan, RTD could deliver peak service on its own. RTD could
also continue to explore the emerging opportunity to deliver the project in partnership with FRPRD.

RTD FasTracks Implementation with Commuter Rail Peak Service Only
RTD could move forward but challenges remain with a funding gap. RTD does not currently have sufficient
funding to implement Peak Service with an expected capital cost of $650 million. The FasTracks Unfinished
Corridors Report, June 2019 shows a completion date for the Peak Service concept in the 2042-2048 range
with current and anticipated funding. A key component of the available funding is the current round of federal
grant programs.
Design issues remain to be resolved at some locations. Continuing work with BNSF to keep open the option of
access to the line is important. Demonstrating a strong, integrated program with multiple local partners could
enhance the probability of being awarded grant funding. RTD will continue to monitor the statewide effort to
advance passenger rail service and coordinate the Peak Service concept with that process. A detailed plan
could be used to start the commuter rail service and, at the same time, be ready to expand the service, while
ensuring not to preclude FRPR. Demonstrating a strong, integrated program with multiple local partners could
enhance the probability of being awarded grant funding

Joint Implementation of RTD Commuter Rail and Intercity Passenger Rail
Legislation passed in 2024 requires RTD and FRPRD to work together to determine whether and how the two
programs could be done together. Completion of the RTD and CDOT studies would enable RTD and FRPRD to
develop a combined approach for improving infrastructure on the corridor and provide service, either jointly or
separately while sharing the common infrastructure. Included in that effort would be an allocation of costs
and responsibilities. Opportunities to share economies of scale could be realized between RTD and FRPRD that
include joint operational efficiencies, shared fleet, and shared costs of improvements. It is reasonable to
expect that cost sharing of common elements would result in a lower cost to each agency.
The first step would outline service and operating plans for each program, and how to integrate with the BNSF
freight service plans. Next, the required infrastructure to start initial operations would be agreed upon, as well
as shared costs and implementation responsibilities. A funding and financing plan would be aligned with the
improvements. RTD and FRPRD would participate jointly in seeking grants and other funding over near-term
and long-range horizons.

Implicit in joining with significant partners is working closely with CDOT, RTD’s long-time partner in the region.
Figure 4 depicts the various entities involved in the discussions related to the Peak Service plan for NWR and
the FRPR proposal. The State of Colorado is moving forward with several programs that lead to the
implementation of intercity passenger rail. CDOT is the lead agency for the State.

We make lives better
through connections.

The following provides an overview of the potential federal grant programs identified previously in Table 4. If
the decision is made to pursue one or more of these grant programs in the future, it is important to remember
that all federal grant awards and federal loans carry substantial regulatory requirements for award, obligation,
and compliance reporting. The Uniform Guidance detailed in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 details overarching
administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for federal awards.
As part of any future decision to pursue federal funding or financing, RTD’s and potential regional partners’
implementation strategy should reflect the potential schedule and cost impacts associated with administrative
and project development requirements tied to the pursuit and use of awarded federal funds. While RTD may
be well-versed in these requirements, if applications are led by regional partners or reflect a joint application,
it will be important to educate the regional partners on the requirements summarized below.
Additionally, for each grant and financing program, the federal department that oversees these programs has
its own requirements. These requirements could result in longer project implementation schedules, delays in
the start of construction, and increased costs. Consideration of these potential impacts on an implementation
schedule should be incorporated as part of federal funding and financing pursuit efforts. Further, each
program carries specific requirements for meeting obligation deadlines (agreement execution), monitoring and
reporting performance measurements, and expending grant funds within a specific time period.
Requirements that should be considered in the context of the current implementation strategy discussions
include:
•

Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, which includes preparation and approval of an
environmental clearance document for the infrastructure project that receives federal funding.

•

Use of local prevailing wage rates as required by the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts Plan.

•

Adherence to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies for Federal and
Federally Assisted Programs for all real-estate acquisition activity.

•

Compliance with Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) requirements of Title 49, Code of Federal
Regulations Part 26 https://www.transportation.gov/osdbu/disadvantaged-business-enterprise/49-cfrpart-26-sample-disadvantaged-business including establishing a DBE participation goal and regular
monitoring and compliance reporting.

or regional significance to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the movement of freight and people
in and across rural and urban areas. As noted earlier, while funding from this program could support some of
the incremental investments needed for the NWR Peak Service, the primary element of the application would
be demonstrating how the project would benefit freight service.

Eligible Project Categories: Eligible projects are those that improve safety, generate economic benefits,
reduce congestion, enhance resiliency, and hold the greatest promise to eliminate freight bottlenecks and
improve critical freight movements.

Potential N WR Peak Service elements that could be funded by an I N FRA grant: These include
sidings, highway-rail crossing improvements and similar trackway improvements.

Revenue Potential: Grant awards can fund up to 60 percent of project costs. Under the BIL, the INFRA

program is authorized for $1.5 billion annually through FY 2026. Additionally, 30 percent of annual funding is
allocated to projects between $5 million and $100 million and 70 percent is allocated to projects over $100
million.

The INFRA program includes categories for large and small projects. For a large project, the minimum INFRA
grant must be at least $25 million. For a small project, including both construction awards and project
development awards, the grant must be at least $5 million. For each fiscal year of INFRA funds, 10 percent of
available funds are reserved for small projects and 90 percent are reserved for large projects.
In the FY 2022 application cycle, 26 transportation projects in 23 states were awarded grants ranging from
$10 million to $150 million and averaged $37.7 million. Examples of recent rail projects that received awards
reflect the following:
•

FY 2022: The Illinois Department of Transportation received $70 million to rehabilitate railroad track,
upgrade signaling, and replace, remove, or rehabilitate 18 viaduct structures on an approximately 1.9mile-long rail segment.

•

FY 2021: The Palmetto Railways, a division of the South Carolina Department of Commerce, received
$25 million to build approximately 22.7 miles of new track and related facilities to connect the Camp
Hall Commerce Park to the CSX rail network.

that will have a significant local or regional impact. This includes projects that support roads, bridges, transit,
rail, ports, or intermodal transportation.

Potential N WR Peak Service elements that could be funded by a RA I SE grant: Sidings, stations,

highway-rail crossing improvements.

Revenue Potential: The largest grant award is $25 million. Under the BIL, the RAISE program is authorized

for $2 billion annually through FY 2026, and the allocation of grant awards must be split 50 percent to urban
areas and 50 percent to rural areas. Additionally, the RAISE program includes a Planning Grant category and a
Construction Grant category.

In 2022, RAISE funded 166 projects in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern
Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. The Construction Grant category awards ranged from $1.1 million
to $25.0 million. Colorado received three RAISE Grants: the Westward Three Project that funded the
construction of three mobility hubs in Grand Junction, Rifle, and Glenwood Springs; the Rio Grande Intermodal
Transportation facility in Alamosa; and the West Side Connector in Pueblo connecting the West Side of the city
with downtown.
Examples of other recent grant awards that were similar to elements of the NWR Peak Service infrastructure
needs include:
•

FY 2022: Downtown Baton Rouge and Gonzales Train Station Project in the City of Gonzales, Louisiana.
The award was for $20 million to acquire right-of-way, design, and construct the two train stations
along the planned Baton Rouge-New Orleans Inter-City Rail Service.

•

FY 2022: The Town of Wake Forest, North Carolina received a $3.4 million grant to fund the planning
of mobility hubs in seven communities along the S-Line passenger rail project. The planning activities
include feasibility and site assessments for all the partner communities, NEPA compliance, and
preliminary engineering for four of the seven communities.

•

FY 2021: The Derby-Shelton Multimodal Transportation Center in Connecticut was awarded $12.6
million to construct a multimodal transportation center. Improvements to the existing Derby-Shelton
Train Station include construction of a high-level rail platform and new bus and rail passenger
amenities, improvements to station safety, rehabilitation of the existing train station building, bus
waiting/loading areas, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, sidewalks and crosswalks throughout the
station site, and improved vehicle parking and bus access.

Appendix 1. Potential Federal Funding and Financing Opportunities

improvements to infrastructure for both intercity passenger and freight railroads by leveraging private, state,
and local funding. The CRISI program is administered by the FRA and invests in a wide range of construction
projects to improve railroad safety, efficiency, and reliability; mitigate congestion at both intercity passenger
and freight rail chokepoints; enhance multi-modal connections; and lead to new or substantially improved
intercity passenger rail transportation corridors. Although this grant program is generally intended for intercity
passenger rail rather than commuter rail, commuter rail projects that implement or sustain PTC systems can
be awarded CRISI grant funding. In these instances, the grant award would be administered by FTA rather
than FRA.

Eligible Project Categories: There are five grant categories (called “tracks”) within the CRISI program, of
which the following three would be relevant to the NWR Peak Service investments: Track 1 - Systems
Planning, Track 2 - Project Development, and Track 3 – Final Design and Construction.

Potential N WR Peak Service elements that could be funded by the CRI SI program: Sidings, PTC,
highway-rail crossing improvements, ductwork.

Revenue Potential: Grant awards can fund up to 60 percent of project costs. Under the BIL, the CRISI

program is authorized for $1.4 billion annually through FY 2026. Additionally, 25 percent of annual funding is
allocated to rural projects, $150 million is allocated for Intercity Passenger Rail Projects, $25 million for
implementing anti-trespassing measures, and $2 million for MagLev projects. Example of recent relevant grant
awards include:
•

FY 2021: The North Carolina DOT received a $57.9 million award to perform surveys and complete
preliminary engineering for the Raleigh to Richmond (R2R) Corridor Program improvements between
Raleigh, NC, and Richmond, VA. The project will advance the next phase of the R2R corridor
development, which will eventually result in new intercity passenger rail service on a state-owned route
that will access currently underserved and minority rural communities with rail service, as well as
improve travel times on the existing Amtrak Silver Meteor service.

•

FY 2021: The City of San Jose received $7.5 million to fund preliminary engineering and environmental
reviews necessary for grade separations at three existing at-grade crossings in a high-fatality corridor.
Additionally, the preliminary engineering and environmental work will allow the project to be built
concurrently with the California High Speed Rail Project that will use the grade separations.

•

FY 2021: $8 million was awarded to the San Diego Association of Governments to replace the Pacific
Surfliner Bridge with a new concrete bridge constructed above the flood zone to ensure safe and
efficient operations. This corridor sees significant daily train traffic for intercity, freight, and commuter
services.

•

FY 2020: $31.8 million was awarded to the Wisconsin DOT for six infrastructure improvements in
Wisconsin and Minnesota on Canadian Pacific’s Soo Line to increase service frequency on the first
state-supported intercity passenger rail between the Twin Cities and Milwaukee. Upgrades include

intermodal connection between vehicles and rail.

M ost Recent A pplication Cycle: The FY 2023 and 2024 NOFO was published on March 29, 2024, and grant
applications were due on May 28, 2024.

Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) Call for Projects

D escription : Every year the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) solicits transportation

projects to be included in the Regional Transportation Plan through the Transportation Improvement Program
(TIP). Local governments within the DRCOG boundaries decide on a process and criteria for including projects
in the TIP and awarding DRCOG-controlled federal and state funds, which allows the region to set and agree
upon its transportation priorities. All program projects must meet current air quality standards.
In addition, RTD is also invited to participate in the Subregional Forums which are responsible for submitting
projects, programs, or studies for consideration by the DRCOG Board. In addition to the main Regional and
Subregional Calls for Projects, DRCOG also develops and maintains a group of regional set-aside programs,
each having their own funding amount and call for projects. RTD is also included in this set of programs.

Eligible Project Categories: Projects that are eligible for inclusion in the TIP and for funding include those
that reduce congestion, improve air quality, maintain a state of good repair on the existing system, capital
costs for transit projects, fringe and corridor parking facilities, highway and transit safety infrastructure
improvements and programs, transportation alternatives activities, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Potential N WR Peak Service Elements that could be funded through the TI P: passing sidings,

stations, at-grade crossings.

Revenue Potential: The amount available per Call varies from year to year. In general, the maximum grant
award is $20 million. The Federal share can cover up to 80 percent of total costs. Examples of recently
awarded projects include:
•

The Federal BRT Corridor received $15 million in the 2024-2027 TIP Regional Share Call #3 for design,
environmental, and early action projects associated with side-running bus rapid transit (BRT). The final
project will include enhanced bus stops, sidewalk improvements, transit lane striping, and operational
improvements including transit signal priority.

•

The East Colfax BRT project received $12 million from the 2022-2025 TIP Regional share and $3 million
from the 2022-2025 TIP Subregional Share for a total funding of $15 million. The awards will fund
preconstruction activity, including design for the center-running bus rapid transit from Civic Center
Station to Yosemite.

•

Boulder County received $8.2 million in the 2020-2023 Regional Share TIP funding allocation to
enhance the BRT system along State Highway (SH) 119, including centering the busway in Longmont,
creating transit bypass lanes on SH 119, and providing Bus Access Transit lanes in Boulder. The project
received an additional $11.2 million in the 2022-2025 TIP First Call.

•

In the 2022-2025 TIP Regional Share – First Call, the City and County of Broomfield received $7.3
million for design and environmental studies for the passenger vehicle, transit, and active
transportation components at six locations along the SH 7 corridor.

M ost Recent A pplication Cycle: In 2022, DRCOG held two Calls for Projects (Regional and Subregional

Share call to program the fiscal year 2022-2025 TIP) that began programming anticipated funding available for
fiscal year 2022 through FY2027. Then, to begin programming a new TIP covering FY2024-2027, DRCOG held
a Regional Share call from late August until early October, and a Subregional Share call from November 2022
until January 2023. At this point, no TIP funding has been identified for the NWR Project.

Grant Funding Programs for the Entire NWR Peak Service Project
The following provides an overview of two potential federal grant programs that could provide funding support
for all infrastructure investments needed for the NWR Peak Service Project.
FTA Capital Investment Grant Program (CIG)

D escription: If the project is classified as a Commuter Rail System, the FTA Capital Investment Grant

Program could provide full funding for the project. Within the CIG program there are three funding categories:
New Starts (project costs greater than $450 M); Small Starts (project costs <$450 M); and Core Capacity
(increase capacity of existing fixed guideway systems by at least 10 percent). The NWR Peak Service Project
could potentially pursue funds under the New Starts category. As noted earlier, a key factor to being
competitive for this grant program is the ridership forecast. Based on the FTA’s Project Justification rating
process, the ridership forecast is an input to four of six Project Justification criteria: Mobility Improvements,
Cost Effectiveness, Environmental Benefits, and Congestion Relief.

Revenue Potential: Historically, New Starts grants have provided between 40 and 50 percent of total project
costs. The BIL significantly increases funding for the CIG program with approximately $23 billion authorized
over the FY 2022 to FY 2026 period.

M ost Recent A pplication Cycle: Unlike other federal discretionary grant programs that have a defined

Appendix 1. Potential Federal Funding and Financing Opportunities

application schedule and submittal date, the CIG program is a multi-year process that can start at any point
during a calendar year

FRA Federal-State Partnership Grant Program

D escription: If the project is classified as an Intercity Passenger Rail System, it would be eligible for the FRA

Federal-State Partnership Grant Program. This program was revised in BIL to include broader eligibility in
terms of project types and selection criteria. More specifically, the BIL provides funding for projects that
replace, rehabilitate, or repair infrastructure, equipment, or a facility used for providing intercity passenger rail

Appendix 1-7

B.1.g

service to bring such assets into a state of good repair; or improve intercity passenger rail service
performance, including reduced trip times, increased train frequencies, higher operating speeds, improved
reliability, expanded capacity, reduced congestion, and electrification; or to expand or establish new intercity
passenger rail service. The program additionally provides funds to complete planning, environmental review,
and final design of an eligible project or group of projects described above.

Revenue Potential: Funding from this program can cover up to 80 percent of total project costs. As enacted,
the BIL appropriated $36 billion over the FY 2022 to FY 2026 period for the program, of which no more than
$24 billion may be awarded to projects on the Northeast Corridor (NEC) and $12 billion would be available for
off-NEC network expansion (National Network).

In addition to the $36 billion appropriated under the BIL, the law also authorizes an additional $7.5 billion
contingent on future Congressional appropriations, of which $3.4 billion to $4.1 billion would be available for
network expansion, with the remainder reserved for projects on the NEC.

M ost Recent A pplication Cycle: The first round of applications for the National Network were submitted on
April 5, 2023. Grant award announcements are expected by the end of 2023.

Federal Financing Programs
The following programs assist local grantees with the financing of major CAPEX projects. To qualify for these
programs the project sponsor needs to demonstrate a reliable revenue stream. These programs provide low
interest loans and not grants.
Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA)
TIFIA is an established federal credit assistance program for eligible transportation projects of national or
regional significance. The goal is to leverage public resources with low interest credit. Under TIFIA, the USDOT
can provide three forms of credit assistance to eligible projects. These means of assistance include secured (or
direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit. Principal amounts of credit assistance provided by
TIFIA are limited to no more than 49 percent of eligible project costs. Additionally, interest rates for TIFIA
loans generally reflect the government’s borrowing costs, and the terms of repayment are generally favorable
to project sponsors. Current Colorado state law for public-private partnerships (§43-1-1202) has no express
provision against the use of TIFIA in the support of financing projects.
Major requirements:
•

Report

B.1.g

•

TIFIA Credit Assistance Limit. Credit assistance is limited to 33 percent of reasonably anticipated
eligible project costs (unless the sponsor provides a compelling justification for up to 49 percent, the
project meets certain rural, transit, or transit-oriented development eligibility, or is part of the
Rural/INFRA/Mega grant Extra programs).

•

Investment Grade Rating. Senior debt and TIFIA loan must receive investment grade ratings from
at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies (only one rating required if less than $75
million).

•

Dedicated Repayment Source. The project must have a dedicated revenue source pledged to
secure both the TIFIA and senior debt financing.

Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program (RRIF)
The RRIF program is a revolving loan and loan guarantee program administered by the FRA. It is legislatively
enabled to issue up to $35 billion in loans. Not less than $7 billion is reserved for projects benefiting freight
railroads other than Class I carriers. The program was established by the Transportation Equity Act for the
21st Century (TEA-21) and amended by the Safe Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Act: A
Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).
The funding may be used to:
•

Acquire, improve, or rehabilitate intermodal or rail equipment or facilities, including track, components
of track, bridges, yards, buildings and shops, and including the installation of positive train control
systems

•

Develop or establish new intermodal or railroad facilities

•

Reimburse planning and design expenses relating to activities listed above

•

Refinance outstanding debt incurred for the purposes listed above

•

Finance transit-oriented development

Attractive interest rates, similar to those available under TIFIA, also exist under RRIF. This program can fund
up to 100 percent of a project’s costs, allows for a five-year grace period, and requires an up-front risk
premium. As RRIF is typically senior debt, a RRIF loan could be combined with a TIFIA subordinate loan. It is
important to note that these sources are loans and will need to be repaid. Eligible borrowers include railroads,
state and local governments, government-sponsored authorities and corporations, limited option freight
shippers that intend to construct a new rail connection, and joint ventures that include at least one of the
preceding.

Appendix 1. Potential Federal Funding and Financing Opportunities

PABs are highly attractive to private investors in conjunction with a public-private partnership program that
includes equity investment, design-build, and operations involvement and could be used in conjunction with
TIFIA/RRIF. For instance, PABs were recently used by RTD in the financing of $398 M for the A, B, and L lines.
Passage of the private activity bond legislation reflects the federal government's desire to increase private
sector investment in U.S. transportation infrastructure. Providing private developers and operators with access
to tax-exempt interest rates lowers the cost of capital significantly, enhancing investment prospects.
Increasing the involvement of private investors in highway and freight projects generates new sources of
money, ideas, and efficiency. The $30 billion in exempt facility bonds is not subject to the state volume caps.

Appendix 1-10

rtd-denver.com

Private Activity Bonds (PABs) are tax-exempt bonds issued by the state or local government on behalf of a
private entity. Their purpose is to facilitate private investment for projects that generate public benefit. PABs
allow for the private sector to borrow at tax-exempt rates resulting in lower overall financing costs.

Joint Service may present an opportunity to streamline planning process,
reduce cost of delivering service and accelerate timeline to deliver starter
service from Denver to Fort Collins on the BNSF line.
The legislature has mandated the Agencies jointly to study this possibility and
report back to them.
Baseline Assumption:
- Each Agency has some assets and some ability to provide service, but as it
stands today, no one Agency can deliver service, alone, in the near term.
- **RTD’s past studies state they cannot start North West Rail service until
2050 at the earliest and even then there remain concerns and questions for
them about their ability to sustain the operations and maintenance costs
with their existing funding.
- Joint Service will neither be the exact service being considered for front
range passenger rail nor the exact service voters approved in the 2004
FasTracks ballot initiative, it would be a hybrid of these proposals that lives
within the confines of the federal definition of intercity passenger rail.

-

Joint Service will not be the exact FRPR service that has been considered C.1.a
to date.
Joint Service will not be the exact FasTrack proposal voters approved in
2004.
The question is: what is an acceptable hybrid service that uses existing
resources and constraints to get starter service running by 2029 ?

Primer of Intercity Passenger Rail v. Commuter Rail:
●

●
●

●
●

Congress has separated grant programs for commuter rail (generally assisted by the Federal
Transit Administration) and intercity passenger rail (assisted by the Federal Railroad
Administration)
Congress has also appropriated bigger increases in intercity rail discretionary grant programs
in the IIJA
Commuter passenger rail is legally defined as “short-haul rail passenger transportation in
metropolitan and suburban areas usually having reduced fare, multiple rides, and commuter
tickets, and morning and evening peak period operations”
Intercity passenger rail is defined as heavy passenger rail operations other than commuter rail
FRA acknowledges some grey area and that some lines can support both types of service; it
can fund intercity projects that have incidental benefit to commuter rail

What is an RTC Model and What will we Learn from It?

●
●
●
●
●

Rail Traffic Controller is a complex computer model that simulates all trains on a rail
system (freight and passenger)
RTC can determine how passenger operations can be effectively added to existing and
expected freight operations
Develop better schedules and capital needs for ensuring no harms to freight operations
Critical for informing access agreements with host railroads, including agreements on
needed capital improvements such as sidings, cross-overs or added track
These capital improvements then inform engineering, financial and environmental
analyses for added service

Uncertain or Unclear
Uncertainties & differing perspectives remain to be resolved:
Goal for Dec 30th Report is to answer as many of these questions as possible.
The exact What and How:
● How will the Agencies be coordinated or jointly govern this service?
● How will the capital construction project be financed?
● How will ongoing operations and maintenance be funded?
● What will be the stations for the Joint Service
● How can the stakeholders and public weigh the pros and cons of Joint
Service versus solo service of Peak Rail and Front Range Passenger Rail ?
