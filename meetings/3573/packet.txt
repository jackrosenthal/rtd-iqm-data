BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Employee Survey Results and Data Evaluation

October 2, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan), the Board established four strategic priorities
and their associated success outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority

Success Outcome

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community
Establish baseline for community value
partner, providing value to customers as well as to the
index and increase by 5%
broader Denver Metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver
high-quality customer service

Establish baseline for customer
promoter score and increase by 5%

net

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a Establish baseline for employee
highly skilled and engaged workforce
promoter score and increase by 5%

net

50% of outcome is that RTD spends less
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management money than it receives; 50% of outcome
of all financial resources
is that the community believes that it
sees value in RTD’s spending
To assess the agency’s progress regarding the strategic priority of Employee Ownership, annual
employee surveys are conducted to discern the employee net promoter score (eNPS), as described
herein, and to gain a deeper understanding of employee perspectives and focus areas for improvement.
The first employee survey, which was developed to garner information regarding the Strategic Plan
metrics, was conducted in 2022. The responses to the 2022 survey provided baseline data against
which future progress can be measured.
DISCUSSION
The second employee survey associated with the Strategic Plan was held over a four-week period in
spring 2023, from April 17 through May 12, to coincide with frontline represented employees’ work
shift selection for the May 2023 service change. To encourage participation, 23 in-person events were
held at nine different facilities. Employees were able to complete the survey at events using a tablet or a

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

printed survey or online via the SurveyMonkey survey platform. Printed copies of the survey were
available at all operations and maintenance facilities for the duration of the survey period.
The survey included questions related to employees’ jobs, employees’ likelihood of recommending RTD
as a place of employment, and satisfaction with a variety of factors ranging from internal services,
management, supervision, Strategic Plan alignment and career development.
A total of 47% of employees participated in the 2023 survey, an improvement from the already
impressive 37% response rate in 2022. Likely factors contributing to the increase are the length of the
survey period, improved technology resources, and the ability to take the survey via a paper form; 17%
of all participating employees utilized the paper survey form. All departments had greater or equal rates
of participation as compared to 2022.
Employee Net Promoter Score
One high-level indicator used to gauge employee satisfaction is the Employee Net Promoter Score
(eNPS). Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric commonly used to measure customer satisfaction and can
be adapted to employee satisfaction. eNPS is derived from responses on a scale from 0-10 to the
question, “How likely are you to recommend working at RTD to friends or family?” Those responding 0-6
are considered detractors, 7-8 are passives, and 9-10 are promoters. The percentage of detractors is
subtracted from the percentage of promoters resulting in the eNPS, measured on a scale of -100 to 100.
The eNPS for 2023 is -1. A different scale was used to calculate the eNPS in 2022. Thus, a conversion
of 2022 data was performed to enable comparison of the responses to the 2023 data. The conversion
was reviewed and authenticated by auditors at RubinBrown, a third-party audit firm contracted by RTD.
The result was an eNPS of 4 in 2022 compared to -1 in 2023.
Staff has realized there are some limitations with the eNPS including the specificity of the question and
unique circumstances surrounding recommending particular employment to friends and family.
Nonetheless, the agency deemed it valuable to include eNPS in the 2023 survey to provide a comparison
to baseline data from the 2022 survey, at which time eNPS was the only high-level indicator analyzed by
the agency.
Composite Index Score
A second high-level indicator has been introduced this year to provide a more accurate representation of
overall employee satisfaction. The Employee Ownership composite index score (index score) is a metric
that gauges responses to a series of survey prompts to assess factors associated with employee
sentiment regarding overall work environment. The index score represents an average of the “agree” and
“strongly agree” responses to six survey prompts related to employees’ feelings of engagement, support
and safety:
•
•

I understand how my performance is linked to the success of the organization
I feel physically safe in my work environment from equipment-related failures, injuries or other
workplace hazards

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

•
•
•
•

I feel comfortable taking risks, expressing ideas and concerns, speaking up with questions and
admitting mistakes
My supervisor is invested in my growth and success
I have the resources to successfully perform my duties
I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment

Internal Services
The 2023 survey included 11 prompts regarding satisfaction with internal services, compared to seven
in 2022, to reflect changes in organizational structure and distinguish Bus and Rail operations divisions
within the Operations Department. It is important to note that satisfaction with internal services
measures employees’ perceptions, attitudes and opinions toward these services, as opposed to actual
employee performance, during a single snapshot in time. Generally, satisfaction with internal services
stayed the same or decreased year over year.
Positive/Negative Response Prompts
Also included in the survey were 17 prompts designed to measure employee sentiment regarding a
variety of measures. The prompts were worded in the affirmative, and a favorable response to a given
prompt is considered as “agree” or “strongly agree” for assessment purposes. Generally, the majority of
respondents responded favorably to all prompts save one. The most favorable response, to which 83%
agreed or strongly agreed, was to the statement, “My supervisor treats me with respect.” This was the
most favorable response in 2022 at 80%, noting that gains were made in this area over the past year.
The least favorable response was to a statement not included in the 2022 survey, “I feel that I am safe
from crime in the work environment,” to which 45% agreed or strongly agreed. There was a noticeable
difference in response rates between represented and non-represented employees, with 35% of
represented employees and 56% of non-represented employees agreeing or strongly agreeing with the
statement.
The largest year-over-year improvement in 2023 can be seen in employees’ understanding of the agency
mission and vision; 70% of employees agreed or strongly agreed that they understood the agency
mission and vision as compared to 48% in 2022. The second largest year-over-year improvement related
to information about agency news, projects and initiatives; 56% agreed or strongly agreed that they felt
adequately informed in 2023 compared to 39% in 2022. While this last improvement is noteworthy, this
metric is in the bottom three for lowest overall ratings. The second lowest rating is related to the metric
of “I am provided the tools to grow my career,” with a 54% positive response rate. The lowest overall
rating, as mentioned above, is related to responses to the prompt of “I feel that I am safe from crime in
the work environment,” which garnered a 45% positive response rate.
Next Steps
The results of the employee survey are influencing and informing workplans throughout the agency that
supports three initiatives: Back to Basics, People Power and Welcoming Transit environment that stem
from the agency’s four strategic priorities. Two projects in development are intended to improve future
responses to the survey prompts of “I am provided the tools to grow my career” led by the Chief People
Officer and “I am adequately informed about agency news, projects and initiatives” led by the Chief

Communications and Engagement Officer. These projects will launch in October 2023. Additionally, the
Chief of Transit Police and Emergency Management has developed tactics to improve employee security
and has established milestones to gauge progress over the next year.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Base Salary Range

October 2, 2023

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 20, 2020, RTD and General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson entered into
a five-year employment agreement (Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and
benefits, as well as a program by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes
performance goals and metrics, annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for
determining future incentive awards and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding
these goals. The Agreement has been amended by the parties four times, with the most recent
amendment adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022. The Third Amendment to the Agreement
provides that RTD will engage a third party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and
benchmarking analysis that will be used by the Board in consultation with GM/CEO Johnson to
determine her compensation for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023.
Furthermore, the Board recently approved its Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO, which outlines
principles to guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation, including the following:
Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis
DISCUSSION
Following a competitive solicitation, Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. was selected to conduct a
comprehensive and systematic benchmarking analysis of the total compensation package for the
GM/CEO, including both external market-based factors and internal equity considerations, to ensure
competitiveness in pay practices. This analysis is intended to inform the Board in its decisions on
compensation for the GM/CEO position relative to market considerations.

Packet Pg. 39

1.C.2

The results of the study were presented to the Performance Committee on November 16, 2022. Those
results as well as the accompanying materials for the 2022 Performance Committee compensation
analysis presentation have been re-included as part of this discussion.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adjusting the base salary range for the GM/CEO position does not automatically equate to a change in
the current GM and CEO's base compensation as that is governed by the existing term contract.

1.C.2.d

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi‐modal transit agency.
An overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment. Therefore, RTD must be market
competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private sectors when considering talent
acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:












Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay‐for‐performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay‐for‐performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO

Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.
Adopted by the RTD Board on September 26, 2023
