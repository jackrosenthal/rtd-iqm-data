O. Recommendation for Modification to RTD Salaried Pension Plan
It is recommended by the Trustees of the RTD Salaried Pension Trust
(the Trust) that the RTD Salaried Pension Plan (the Plan) be modified.
The Trustees recommend either that current Trust documents be
amended to allow the RTD Board of Directors to provide for greater
than 9 percent annual funding or that the Plan is closed to future RTD
employees hired on or after January 1, 2008. If the RTD Board
chooses not to increase the contribution above the 9 percent rate,
the Trustees recommend that for all current RTD salaried staff the
benefit structure of the Plan remain unchanged.
For future
employees hired on or after January 1, 2008 the Trustees
recommend that the RTD Board of Directors implement a new
retirement program that would provide for a defined contribution by
RTD and be self-directed by the employee. It is important to note
that either of these recommended changes to the Plan would have no
negative impact on any existing salaried RTD employees or existing
salaried pension retirees.
This item generated much discussion and debate. Director Yamrick
made note that some of the recommendation language was not
agreed to by the Trustee Board. Director Pulliam acknowledged and
stated some of the language was presumptuous pending the result of
the Salary Pension presentation that was on the agenda for the Study
Session later that evening. Further discussion was deferred to the
Study Session meeting 11/13/07.

provision of call-n-Ride service. The amendment to Contract 17-DH028 shall not exceed $3,843,447 for the initial 3 years and
