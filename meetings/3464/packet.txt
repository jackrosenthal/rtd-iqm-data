Authorization

April 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
April 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the summary scope of work for a solicitation, and to subsequently
authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) to enter into a contract, for consulting services for
the development of a holistic Low/No Emission Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan (Plan) compliant with
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Pub. L. 117-58, in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Environmental Sustainability
The Board of Directors has collectively demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to addressing the
climate impacts of the agency’s services, programs, and initiatives throughout the Denver metro region,
both in terms of operating and administrative facilities as well as the existing fixed-route bus fleet.
First among RTD’s Board-adopted Strategic Plan Priorities is Community Value, which states: “RTD
strives to be a community partner, providing value to customers as well as to the broader Denver metro
region while sustaining planet Earth.”
In support of this priority, the agency is committed to supporting local, state, and national efforts to
mitigate to the extent feasible the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including those derived
from operating and administrative facilities, as well as fixed-routes buses.
Further, the objective of sustainability, one of the Reimagine RTD initiative’s Board-adopted guiding
principles, was a key tenet of the agency’s multi-year effort to evaluate, forecast, and collaborate with
partners to meet the changing mobility needs of the region. Moreover, RTD is participating in the Federal
Transit Administration’s "Sustainable Transit for a Healthy Planet Challenge,” having pledged in April
2022 to 1) increase transit use/reduce single-occupancy vehicle use within the region, 2) decrease
carbon dioxide emissions resulting from facilities, fleet vehicles, and fuel use, and 3) use an agency-wide
approach to reduce GHG emissions and increase sustainability as a component of the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan implementation.
Current Bus Facilities

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

RTD currently owns and directly provides transit services from three bus division facilities across the
service area. The Platte, East Metro and Boulder facilities were purpose-designed in the late 1970’s for a
diesel fleet and became operational in the early 1980’s. Over the years these facilities have been
modified to accommodate diesel bus fleet replacements and upgraded to current building codes. These
facilities meet RTD’s transit service delivery requirements.
Current Diesel Bus Fleet
RTD’s current fixed-route bus fleet includes more than 1,000 clean-diesel vehicles, which are operated
by RTD directly and by contractors. Given the size of the current fleet; the typical useful service life of
diesel buses as well as federal minimum (12-year/500,000 mile) service-life requirements; and the
magnitude of the facilities enhancements that will be required to house, maintain, and support
alternatively fueled transit vehicles, the transition toward lower-emission and zero-emission buses is a
significant undertaking that will require many years to fully implement.
Alternatively Fueled Buses
RTD was an early adopter of low/no emission technologies. The agency’s first steps toward a low/noemission bus fleet transition were taken in 2000, with the deployment of hybrid electric/compressed
natural gas (CNG) buses along the 16th Street Mall. A subfleet of hybrid diesel/electric fixed-route buses
followed in 2008. The CNG-powered MallRide buses were also later replaced by a fleet of 36 zeroemission BEBs in 2017. The agency has garnered operational knowledge through the deployment and
maintenance of these low- and no-emission vehicles, as well as industry best practices and lessons
learned, both by RTD and other public transit service providers throughout North America and globally.
Transition Planning
In order to holistically transition to low/no emission facilities and fixed-route buses, staff requires
assistance from a consultancy with the appropriate subject matter expertise in order to thoughtfully and
comprehensively lay the groundwork for the low/no emission transition of the agency’s facilities and
fleet in the interests of:
1) Following established policy guidance
2) Achieving aspirational emission reduction strategies
3) Facilitating the agency’s pursuit of state and federal grant funding to bolster low/no emission
transition efforts
DISCUSSION
Adoption of this recommended action demonstrates the agency’s commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success. Considering the timeliness
and critical nature of this endeavor, by adopting this recommended action, the Board:
1) Approves the summary scope of work for a solicitation for contractor services, as described
herein, for the development of the Plan
2) Authorizes the GM/CEO to enter into a contract for consulting services to assist in the
development of the Plan
SCOPE OF WORK SUMMARY
A consultancy will ultimately develop the agency’s Plan. As required by federal law, the Plan must:

Demonstrate a long-term fleet management plan with a strategy for RTD’s use of funding for
resources and future acquisitions. This should include a phasing and transition schedule
Address the availability of current and future resources to meet costs for the transition and
implementation
Consider policy and legislation impacting relevant technologies
Include an evaluation of existing and future facilities and their relationship to the technology
transition
Describe the partnership of RTD with the applicable utility or alternative fuel provider
Examine the impact of the transition on RTD’s then-current workforce by identifying skill gaps,
training needs, and retraining needs of the existing workers of the applicant to operate and
maintain zero-emission vehicles and related infrastructure, assess alignment with equal
employment opportunity utilization and workforce analysis goals and avoid displacement of the
existing workforce

In developing the Plan, the consultancy will:
• Review previously conducted RTD studies and plans
• Develop a comprehensive project management plan outlining how the work can be accomplished
by Q4 2024 or sooner (with appropriate quality checks)
• Evaluate existing RTD facilities to assess the elements required to facilitate zero-emission
transition
• Analyze existing fixed-route services, along with projected fixed-route services outlined within the
System Optimization Plan, to determine and project the fixed-route fleet mix needed to support
projected services as well as to conduct route modeling
• Assess various vehicle propulsion technologies supportive of existing and projected services
• Determine workforce needs associated with the identified propulsion technologies
• Evaluate financial options, including alternative funding sources, for the facilities and fleet
transition, leveraging RTD’s mid-term and long-range financial plans
• Develop a recommended fleet mix for fixed-route services by fleet and sub-fleet type,
replacement technologies for each of these fleets, and the replacement schedule for each vehicle
along with projected replacement costs
• Determine an optimal facilities strategy, along with an associated implementation timeline and
cost analysis, to accommodate the recommended fleet mix that will contemplate the following
elements:
o Technology constraints
o Maintenance/fueling/charging needs
o Building code requirements
o Operational capacity and storage needs
o Number and location of bus facilities across the service area
o Required modifications to existing bus garages
o Site planning, including identification of potential locations for new operating facilities

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Termination of Contract for Battery Electric Buses with
New Flyer of America, Inc.

April 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
April 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) to terminate for
convenience the contract with New Flyer of America, Inc. (New Flyer) for the purchase of 17 battery
electric buses (BEBs), negotiate termination costs with New Flyer for work satisfactorily performed prior
to termination, and pay such costs from local project funds.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is committed to supporting local, state, and national initiatives to mitigate to the extent feasible the
impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including those derived from operating and administrative
facilities and from vehicles, including fixed-route buses. RTD staff are active participants on public
transit industry committees and in discussions across the industry regarding optimal strategies for
addressing GHG emissions. The agency has demonstrated this commitment to mitigating GHG emissions
for decades and was an early adopter of reduced-emission diesel buses as well as vehicles propelled by
alternative fuels.
The agency’s first steps toward a low/no-emission bus fleet transition were taken in 2000, with the
deployment of hybrid electric/compressed natural gas (CNG) buses along the 16th Street Mall. A
subfleet of hybrid diesel/electric fixed-route buses followed in 2008. The CNG-powered MallRide buses
were also later replaced by a fleet of 36 zero-emission BEBs in 2017.
Continuing these transition efforts, RTD sought, and in FFY2019 was awarded, grant funds in the
amount of $2,600,000 from the Federal Transit Administration’s Low or No Emission Competitive Grant,
as well as $8,542,500 from the Volkswagen Settlement Trust Fund Grant administered by the Colorado
Department of Transportation, for the purchase in aggregate of 17 BEBs and related charging
infrastructure, leveraging $8,733,500 in local funds.
On November 16, 2021, the day following President Biden’s signing of the federal Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law (BIL), Pub. L. 117-58, the Board authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a contract with
New Flyer to purchase 17 40-foot BEBs. The contract was executed on January 26, 2022.

Packet Pg. 7

1.D.2

In keeping with RTD’s goals of reducing or eliminating emissions to the extent feasible, as the BEB
solicitation and subsequently the procurement with New Flyer were underway, staff continued to
evaluate many factors related to the integration of the BEBs into its service delivery model and
maintenance and operating facilities. Based on these factors, staff determined a new or retrofitted
facility would be required for any new BEBs.
RTD suspended the New Flyer contract for a six-month period, effective October 11, 2022, as staff
continued to conduct its facilities and infrastructure assessment. As a result of the efforts, it was
determined that the specialized nature of any facility designed and equipped to support the unique
charging, maintenance, and housing needs of the 17 BEBs would critically limit the facility’s capacity to
support vehicles utilizing other low- or no-emission propulsion technologies or related components.
In assessing the optimal location for such a facility, staff determined that the most suitable existing RTD
property available was the East Metro facility, which was originally purpose-built over 40 years ago for a
large diesel fixed-route bus fleet. Staff determined that retrofitting the East Metro facility was not
practical at this time and instead opted to explore the construction of a new building adjacent to the
facility. Staff further determined that, given geographic constraints at that location, a new facility would
be large enough only for 25 BEBs. Newly constructed buildings are estimated to cost $85,000,000.
DISCUSSION
Holistic Approach to Reducing GHG Emissions
The BIL amended the statutory provisions of the Low or No Emission Grants Program to include the
requirement that any applications for projects related to zero-emission vehicles must include a ZeroEmission Transition Plan. The plan must include a wide array of considerations, including, but not limited
to, an evaluation of existing and future facilities in relation to the technology transition, an examination
of the impact on current workforce, and a forecast of future acquisitions. In short, a plan for transition
to reducing or eliminating emissions must consider many integrated aspects of a transit system to
ensure success.
In the interest of fulfilling federal BIL requirements as well as the aspirational goals of the State of
Colorado’s Climate Action Plan and GHG Pollution Reduction Roadmap, it has become clear that a
comprehensive approach is critical to the agency’s long-term emission reduction/elimination strategy.
Considering these policy guidelines, as well as evolving electric vehicle industry standards, RTD has an
opportunity to develop a roadmap for the holistic transition of its facilities and fleet, which contemplates
all components of the agency’s transit system, both now and in future years, in a sustainable,
responsible, and cost-efficient manner.
Termination for Convenience
Staff is recommending the termination of the New Flyer contract in alignment with the agency’s holistic
approach to reducing GHG emissions. The New Flyer contract provides that RTD may terminate the
contract at any time for RTD’s convenience upon 14 days’ written notice to New Flyer. RTD must
compensate New Flyer for the work satisfactorily performed prior to the date of termination.
Strategic Priorities

Packet Pg. 8

1.D.2

In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Board-adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan Priorities of:
A. Community Value and Customer Excellence: RTD is dedicated to providing environmentally
sustainable mobility options to the community and sustaining planet Earth. Communities and
customers will benefit from a holistic, system-wide approach to reducing emissions that results in
cleaner air, a longer service range, and reduced operational and maintenance costs
B. Employee Ownership: RTD’s holistic approach to transitioning to net emissions fleet will
emphasize the importance of retaining RTD’s current workforce and attracting new talent. The
agency will examine the impact of the transition on the current workforce by identifying skill
gaps, training needs, and retraining needs of the existing workers to operate and maintain zeroemission vehicles and related infrastructure and avoid displacement of existing employees
C. Financial Success: Terminating the New Flyer contract will save RTD significant costs for
infrastructure with limited, long-term value, while a comprehensive approach to reducing or
eliminating emissions will align with the agency’s short and long-range financial plans and will
ultimately result in reduced operational and maintenance costs
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Upon termination of the New Flyer contract for convenience, RTD will be required to pay New Flyer for
work satisfactorily performed prior to termination.

BACKGROUND
According to the United Nations and leading scientists around the world, “in order to avert the worst
impacts of climate change and preserve a livable planet, global temperature increase needs to be limited
to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels to keep global warming to no more than 1.5°C – as called for in the
Paris Agreement – emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.”
(https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition)
Operating under this goal, public agencies and private companies have worked collaboratively to work
towards achieving Net Zero by the timelines listed above. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, as managed and
published by World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development, has
emerged as the leading, global set of standards and frameworks to measure greenhouse gas emissions.
https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us.
As defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol:
• Scope 1 GHG emissions are those emissions that are directly released and created by the
Agency.

•

Scope 2 GHG emissions are those emissions that occur as a consequence of supplied electricity,
heat, steam, and/or cooling.
Scope 3 GHG emissions are those emissions that occur as a result of activities taking place at the
Agency. These are typically emissions that are created as part of the supply chain

Both locally and across the United States, transportation agencies and governments who manage
transportation agencies have committed to transitioning to a zero emission fleet and reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. RTD’s commitment delivers strong community value, both by aligning
with what Coloradans have clearly stated is a priority, reducing overall GHG emissions, and by removing
those same direct emissions that pollute some of our most vulnerable communities.

DISCUSSION
Here in Colorado, in 2019, the Colorado General Assembly passed an aggressive greenhouse gas
reduction bill: H.B. 19-1261. The legislation set a goal to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions
from all sources by 26 percent by 2025, 50 percent by 2030, and 90 percent by 2050, compared to a
2005 baseline. In 2021, the Governor’s Office released a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap, which
showed transportation as one of the largest sources of Greenhouse Gas pollution.
The recommended action before the Board demonstrates RTD’s strong commitment to partnership and
being part of the climate solution. The Recommended Action is more robust when it comes to reducing
GHG emissions than most plans as it requires RTD to not only transition its bus fleet, but its entire fleet
of vehicles (Scope 1 emissions) along with the energy used to power those vehicles and all our

Strategic Plan Alignment
Community Value - RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers as well
as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth. The community around us regularly
strives to reduce carbon output. A transition to ZEV allows RTD to move with our community
stakeholders in a transition away from GHG emitting vehicles and the fossil fuel industry. Further, this
reduces harmful pollution in some of our most vulnerable communities.
Customer Excellence - RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service. Customers
regularly ask for more sustainable vehicles. Many ZEVs require less maintenance, allowing vehicles to
stay in use for longer without the same maintenance.
Employee Ownership - RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce. The
transition to Zero Emission Buses and a more efficient agency requires cross training, training of new
skills, and preparing a workforce for the future instead of holding them in the past.
Financial Success - RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources. While the
upfront investment in renewable sources, energy efficiency, low emission buses may be higher than
using traditional sources, many of these same investments save funds in the long run through reduced
future costs. Over time, this allows RTD to make investments now that will last through our future.

About Us | Greenhouse Gas Protocol
What is GHG Protocol?

Building on a 20-year partnership between World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD), GHG Protocol works with governments, industry associations, NGOs, businesses
and other organizations.
We offer online training on our standards and tools, as well as the “Built on GHG Protocol” review service, which
recognizes sector guidance, product rules and tools that are in conformance with GHG Protocol standards.

Who Uses GHG Protocol?
GHG Protocol supplies the world's most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. The Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard provides the accounting platform for virtually every corporate GHG reporting program in the
world.
Companies and Organizations
In 2016, 92% of Fortune 500 companies responding to the CDP used GHG Protocol directly or indirectly through a
program based on GHG Protocol.
Learn more about our work for companies and organizations.
Countries and Cities
Through their commitment to the Compact of Mayors, hundreds of cities across the globe have committed to using the
GHG Protocol for Cities.
We also work with partners in key countries to develop national GHG emissions programs based on the GHG Protocol.
Learn more about our work for cities and countries .

History of GHG Protocol
GHG Protocol arose when WRI and WBCSD recognized the need for an international standard for corporate GHG
accounting and reporting in the late 1990s. Together with large corporate partners such as BP and General Motors, in
1998 WRI published a report called, “Safe Climate, Sound Business.” It identified an action agenda to address climate
change that included the need for standardized measurement of GHG emissions.
Similar initiatives were being discussed at WBCSD. In late 1997, WRI senior managers met with WBCSD officials and an
agreement was reached to launch an NGO-business partnership to address standardized methods for GHG accounting.
WRI and WBCSD convened a core steering group comprised of members from environmental groups (such as WWF, Pew
Center on Global Climate Change, The Energy Research Institute) and industry (such as Norsk Hydro, Tokyo Electric,
Shell) to guide the multi-stakeholder standard development process.
The first edition of the Corporate Standard, published in 2001, has been updated with additional guidance that clarifies
how companies can measure emissions from electricity and other energy purchases, and account for emissions from
throughout their value chains. GHG Protocol also developed a suite of calculation tools to assist companies in calculating
their greenhouse gas emissions and measure the benefits of climate change mitigation projects.
The Paris Agreement, adopted within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in
December 2015, commits participating all countries to limit global temperature rise, adapt to changes already occurring,
and regularly increase efforts over time. GHG Protocol is developing standards, tools and online training that helps
countries and cities track progress towards their climate goals.

Metro is transitioning to a 100% zero-emission bus fleet to improve regional air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide customers with a
quieter, comfier ride. This will require a phased approach that gets Metro to a fully zero-emission fleet of more than 1,500 buses by 2045. Transitioning to
zero-emission technology requires more than just new buses; Metro will also invest in facility and infrastructure upgrades over the coming years to support the
introduction of new buses.

E.2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

E.2.1 CARB’s Innovative Clean Transit Regulation
CARB’s ICT regulation requires all public transit agencies in the State of California to transition from
conventional buses (compressed natural gas, diesel, etc.) to ZE buses (battery-electric or fuel cell
electric) by 2040. The regulation requires a progressive increase of an agency’s new bus purchases to
be zero-emission buses (ZEBs) based on fleet size. By 2040, CARB requires all transit agencies in the
state to be operating only ZEBs.
To ensure that each agency has a strategy to comply with the 2040 requirement, the ICT regulation
requires each agency, or a coalition of agencies, to submit a ZEB Rollout Plan before purchase
requirements take effect. The Rollout Plan is considered a living document and is meant to guide the
implementation of ZEB fleets and help transit agencies work through many of the potential challenges
and explore solutions. Each Rollout Plan must include a number of required components (as outlined
in the Rollout Plan Guidelines) and must be approved by the transit agency’s governing body through
the adoption of a resolution, prior to submission to CARB.
Metro must comply with the following requirements under the ICT regulation:
-

July 1, 2020 – Board-approved Rollout Plan must be submitted to CARB5
January 1, 2023 – 25 percent of all new bus purchases must be ZE
January 1, 2026 – 50 percent of all new bus purchases must be ZE
January 1, 2029 – 100 percent of all new bus purchases must be ZE
January 1, 2040 – 100 percent of fleet must be ZE
March 2021 – March 2050 – Annual compliance report due to CARB

E.2.2 Zero-Emission Bus Technologies
According to the ICT regulation, a ZEB is a bus with zero tailpipe emissions and is either a batteryelectric bus (BEB) or a fuel cell electric bus (FCEB).
BEBs depend on a system to store and retrieve energy much as cars and trucks need fuel. BEBs have
multiple battery packs that power an electric motor, resulting in ZE. Similar to many other batterypowered products, BEBs must be charged for a period of time to be operational. Currently, BEBs can
be charged at the facility or in-service (on-route charging) via a number of connectors and dispensers.
A FCEB uses hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity through an electrochemical reaction to power
the propulsion system and auxiliary equipment. This ZE process has only water vapor as a byproduct.
FCEBs can replace diesel or compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel buses without significant changes to
operations and service and functions as a resilient backup alternative in case of natural disaster. The
5 Due to the impacts of COVID-19, CARB provided an extension to all large transit agencies in California, upon request. Metro requested

and was granted an extension to submit the Rollout Plan by December 31, 2020. In October 2020, Metro requested and was granted
another extension to accurately capture the results of the recently released NextGen Plan and other service- and market-related updates.
Metro now will submit its Board-approved Rollout Plan to CARB by March 2021.

Attachment: 2023-03-21 ZEV Meeting Packet (4768 : Zero Emission Policy - Draft Proposed Amendment)

In accordance with the California Air Resource Board’s (CARB) Innovative Clean Transit (ICT)
regulation, the following report serves as Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
(Metro) Rollout Plan to transition its bus fleet to 100 percent zero-emission (ZE) by 2040.

1.E.1.a

Metro’s past and ongoing ZEB analysis has found that BEB adoption is the ZEB technology that best
aligns with Metro’s 2030 ZEB goals. This is in a large part due to the market of BEBs in terms of
technological advancement, costs, and availability. While FCEBs are promising and have many potential
benefits (as compared to both CNG and BEB), unpredictability in operation costs and a limited supply
chain makes it an unviable option at this time, especially considering Metro’s aggressive ZEB goals.
However, Metro will continue to monitor FCEB advancements and consider the technology in future
applications.

E.2.3 Metro’s Zero-Emission Bus Efforts
Metro is already embracing the prospects of a ZE future and is taking multiple steps to not only meet
the requirements of CARB’s ICT regulation, but to also provide a cleaner and more sustainable future
for the communities that it serves. These efforts include:
-

-

-

-

Metro’s Strategic Plan to ZEB Transition. In 2017, the Metro Board endorsed staff’s Strategic Plan
for the transition to ZEBs. The first phase is to convert the Orange Line to ZEBs by 2020 and the
Silver Line as soon as feasible, thereafter. The second phase involves the creation of a ZE Master
Plan that would evaluate the entire Metro bus system and map out the best strategy and anticipated
cost to convert to ZE operation.
BEB and Infrastructure Investments. Shortly after the Board’s endorsement of the 2017 Strategic
Plan, Metro awarded three ZEB contracts for the electrification of the Orange and Silver Lines; two
with BYD for five 60-foot ZEBs intended for the Orange Line and 60 40-foot ZEBs for the Silver
Line, and one with New Flyer for 40 60-foot ZEBs for the Orange Line. To support these BEBs,
Metro is in the process of installing 10 plug-in chargers at Division 8 and eight on-route chargers
to support the Orange Line’s transition. In September 2019, Metro’s Board approved exercising
the options of 40 additional BYD 40-foot ZEBs. With this exercise, Metro has plans to deploy 145
BEBs.
ZEB Program Master Plan. In July 2018, Metro awarded “ZEBGO”, a joint venture of multiple
industry experts to produce a Master Plan and action-ready RFPs to transition to all ZEBs by 2030
– an ambitious plan that will guide Metro in adopting all ZEBs - 10 years before the ICT regulation
requires.
NextGen Study. While not directly tied to ZEB efforts, Metro is currently restructuring existing
service to better meet the needs of current and future riders. The NextGen Bus Study will evaluate
a number of alternatives and strategies to improve service, which may include more frequent
service and shorter headways. This study is ongoing and is being coordinated with Metro’s ZEB
Master Plan efforts.

E.2.4 Metro’s Path to an All-Zero-Emission Fleet
The Rollout Plan identifies a strategy for Metro to procure and operate an all-ZEB fleet by 2030 – ten
years before the ICT regulation requires. In accordance with the Rollout Plan Guidance, this document
provides an overview of a number of key components to Metro’s ZEB transition, including fleet
acquisitions, schedule, training, and funding considerations. As previously mentioned, Metro is
currently studying and has a goal of transitioning to all ZEBs by 2030. Therefore, there are no
anticipated issues with meeting the ICT regulation’s 2040 requirement.

fuel cell is generally used in conjunction with a battery, which supplements the fuel cell’s power during
peak loads and stores electricity that is recaptured through regenerative braking, allowing for better
fuel economy.

1.E.1.a

It should also be noted that COVID-19 has caused unprecedented losses in Metro’s revenue through
both the loss of fares from diminished ridership and loss of sales tax revenue from a reduction in Los
Angeles consumer spending. For these reasons, Metro has reduced service and operations and is still
evaluating the long-term ramifications on the system and the agency’s capital projects and goals. Metro
will proceed with planning and will adjust as the results from COVID-19 impacts stabilize and trends
are more predictable.
The following subsections provide a brief summary of the Rollout Plan.
E.2.4.1

Baseline Conditions

As of December 2018, Metro currently operates a fleet approximately 2,230 buses out of 11 divisions.
Another 165 buses are leased to contractors to operate Metro routes. Table E.2-1 summarizes each
division and its respective fleet.

Due to the rapidly evolving nature of ZEB technologies, it is possible that the findings and
recommended approaches in this report will be outdated when it is time for implementation. The
information in this Rollout Plan is informed and based on December 2018 service levels. This
information is used because it represents the fleet under typical operating conditions. Since then, there
have been a number of special projects, including bus bridges, that may skew the fleet size and division
requirements.

Proposed Zero-Emission Implementation Strategy

To achieve ZEB goals, Metro will adopt an inverted pantograph solution at both divisions and strategic
layover locations (on-route charging). This technology (Figure E.2-1 and Figure E.2-2) will maximize
space and safety of personnel due to the reduced interaction between staff and electrified equipment.
These pantographs will be connected to chargers that vary in power. At this time, division-based
chargers are expected to be provide 150 kilowatts (kW) of power in a “one to many” orientation (i.e.,
one charger energizes more than one dispenser), and on-route chargers will provide power in excess
of 300 kW.

Phasing and Construction

To maintain Metro’s transition schedule, the availability of buses, construction schedule adherence,
and utility enhancements will all have to be aligned.
Metro’s transition will be accomplished in multiple on-site construction stages across three phases
(periods). These “stages” are segments of the division that will be temporarily shut down to install the
necessary BEB-supporting infrastructure. The buses that would normally occupy the staging space will
be temporarily relocated on-site or to a neighboring division or facility. This approach will ensure that
construction and normal operations can proceed concurrently. This construction method avoids the
complete shutdown of the division undergoing improvements, which reduces the risks of service
impacts. The number of stages and number of buses that need to be temporarily relocated during each
stage vary based on a division’s layout, existing fleet, and additional capacity.
“Phases” are essentially classifications of when and how these divisions are grouped. Phase 1 of the
transition is currently underway with the electrification of the Orange and Silver Lines. The remaining
two phases are grouped based on a division’s space availability and dependency on other divisions for
temporary bus relocation. Phase 2 generally consists of “independent” divisions, divisions that have

division that does, and Phase 3, consists of “dependent” divisions, divisions that are dependent on
other divisions for temporary bus storage or service.

Figure E.2-3 presents the preliminary transition schedule. These activities include supplying additional
power to the division, which includes utility applications, design, and construction, and the
procurement, design, and construction of on-site charging equipment.

Start-Up and Scale-Up Issues

To meet ICT deadlines, there are several challenges and opportunities that Metro has identified. The
following briefly described some of the challenges that Metro faces for its transition:
-

-

-

Technological adaptation. Currently, Metro is modeling and planning for a transition based on the
baseline service and existing ZEB technology. With 2030 and 2040 deadlines looming, it is difficult
to anticipate future technological enhancements and changes, such as improved batteries and
chargers. Slight changes in these technologies could improve bus ranges, in turn, reducing costs.
Metro will monitor these changes as it would be counterproductive to invest in technologies that
will soon be outdated.
Costs. Adoption of ZEBs has many benefits, including potential lifecycle cost savings. However,
the investment required for capital and change management will be very expensive. Metro will
have to be creative with funding mechanisms and sources to ensure that the transition to ZEB will
not be detrimental to its operations and service.
Market Production Factors. The ICT regulation will put a lot of pressure on OEMs to produce ZEBs
at unprecedented rates. However, it is not only California that is interested in converting to ZEBs.

Attachment: 2023-03-21 ZEV Meeting Packet (4768 : Zero Emission Policy - Draft Proposed Amendment)

As technology advances, Metro will make adjustments to maximize utility and cost feasibility. This will
have direct impacts on the implementation schedule.

-

-

-

-

Legislative changes, such as the ICT regulation, will make it challenging to meet ZEB goals for
agencies if the supply of buses cannot meet the demand.
Phasing and Transition. Maintaining service and adhering to ICT regulation purchase
requirements, all while managing on-site construction, facility rebuilds, temporary bus relocations,
bus procurements, and utility enhancements introduces a lot of risk to the Metro’s program. If one
element of this transition doesn’t go as planned, there will be implications for other components
of the program.
Utility Upgrades. Metro’s divisions are currently under the jurisdiction of two utilities and its
potential on-route charging locations are under nine. These utilities have different rate structures
and protocols to apply for and receive additional power. How each utility is regulated, whether
municipal or private, also dictates procedural requirements. These nuances will make it
challenging to plan for due to the variances in schedule and procedure.
Managing Power Demand. The transition to BEBs will require strategies to ensure that Metro can
utilize power in the most cost-efficient way. Metro is currently doing this via utility negotiations
and demand modeling to determine methods to reduce peak demand.
Uncertainty due to COVID-19. COVID-19 has impacted all facets of the global economy, transit is
not an exclusion. During the pandemic, ridership and revenues have plummeted and caused major
shortfalls in Metro’s budget which has impacted capital programs and operations. At this time, it
is unclear what short- and long-term impacts will be for service. There is a possibility that service
ridership levels may not return to previous levels resulting in changes to procurement and funding.
Metro will continue to analyze trends to determine changes and plans.

E.2.4.5

Next Steps

The process to transition to ZEBs should and will be iterative to minimize risk, but also to
accommodate new developments in a rapidly evolving market. Metro will use the information outlined
in the Master Plan to identify and further refine the following:
-

-

-

-

Solutions to complete service if technology does not advance as forecasted. Approximately 31
percent of Metro’s baseline bus blocks travel further than 150 miles per day – a range that exceeds
current batteries’ capabilities. In order to meet 100% service completion, Metro will have to
consider other solutions, including investing in additional on-route charging, filing for exemptions
under the ICT regulation, purchasing additional buses, or restructuring service to suit
technological limitation.
Costs refinement. Construction, capital, operating, and maintenance costs vary based on a number
of factors. It will be important to get an understanding of the up-front and lifecycle costs and
savings of investing in ZEBs. Staff continues to develop cost estimates and Metro will need to
revisit these estimates to determine if pricing has changed and make adjustments to
procurements, as needed.
Explore collaboration opportunities. Metro can continue to maximize outcomes by engaging with
other regional and local agencies. Best practices, lessons learned, and cost-sharing among agencies
will provide net benefits for Metro and partner agencies.
Continue to engage utilities. Whether adopting BEBs or FCEBs, there is a good chance that the
amount of power at the division is either insufficient or needs to be adapted to these new
technologies. While procuring buses and installing chargers may be relatively straightforward, the
process and protocols associated with electrical enhancements on the utility side can be complex.
Therefore, it is essential that Metro continues to coordinate with electric utility providers to ensure
critical deadlines are met.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Innovative Clean Transit Regulation

The California Air Resource Board’s (CARB) Innovative Clean Transit (ICT) regulation became
effective October 1, 2019 and requires all public transit agencies in the state to transition from
conventional buses (compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel, etc.) to ZE buses (battery-electric or fuel
cell electric) by 2040. The regulation requires a progressive increase of an agency’s new bus purchases
to be zero-emission buses (ZEBs) based on its fleet size. By 2040, CARB expects all transit agencies in
the state to be operating only ZEBs.
To ensure that each agency has a strategy to comply with the 2040 requirement, the ICT regulation
requires each agency, or a coalition of agencies (“Joint Group”), to submit a ZEB Rollout Plan (“Rollout
Plan”) before purchase requirements take effect. The Rollout Plan is considered a living document and
is meant to guide the implementation of ZEB fleets and help transit agencies work through many of
the potential challenges and explore solutions. Each Rollout Plan must include a number of required
components (as outlined in the Rollout Plan Guidelines) and must be approved by the transit agency’s
governing body through the adoption of a resolution, prior to submission to CARB.
According to the ICT regulation, each agency’s requirements are based on its classification as either a
“Large Transit Agency” or a “Small Transit Agency”. The ICT defines a Large Transit Agency as an
agency that operates in the South Coast or the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin and operates more than
65 buses in annual maximum service or it operates outside of these areas, but in an urbanized area
with a population of at least 200,000 and has at least 100 buses in annual maximum service. A Small
Transit Agency is an agency that doesn’t meet the above criteria.
As a “Large Transit Agency” Metro must comply with the following requirements under the ICT
regulation:
-

July 1, 2020 – Board-approved Rollout Plan must be submitted to CARB6
January 1, 2023 – 25 percent of all new bus purchases must be ZE
January 1, 2026 – 50 percent of all new bus purchases must be ZE
January 1, 2029 – 100 percent of all new bus purchases must be ZE
January 1, 2040 – 100 percent of fleet must be ZE
March 2021 – March 2050 – Annual compliance report due to CARB

6 Due to the impacts of COVID-19, CARB provided an extension to all large transit agencies in California, upon request. Metro requested

and was granted an extension to submit the Rollout Plan by December 31, 2020. In October 2020, Metro requested and was granted
another extension to accurately capture the results of the recently released NextGen Plan and other service- and market-related updates.
Metro now will submit its Board-approved Rollout Plan to CARB by March 2021.

In accordance with the California Air Resource Board’s Innovative Clean Transit regulation, the
following report serves as Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (Metro)
Rollout Plan to transition its bus fleet to 100 percent zero-emission (ZE) by 2040.

1.E.1.a

1.2

Metro’s Background

As of December 2018, Metro directly and indirectly operates approximately 2,400 buses on 165 routes.
In that same time period, directly operated Metro lines served approximately 17.3 million riders, per
day.

1.3

Metro’s Existing ZEB Plans, Procurements, and Projects

As early as 1993, Metro has adopted policies that commit the agency to using alternative energy buses.
Pursuant to this vision, Metro successfully transitioned the second largest bus fleet in North America
from all-diesel to CNG in 2011 and has continued to commit to innovative technologies and strategies
to further reduce its carbon footprint. The conversion to ZEBs is the next step in Metro’s future and it
has the opportunity to further improve the air quality for Los Angeles residents and visitors in the
future.
The transition to a ZEB fleet has been a goal of Metro even before the ICT regulation was adopted. In
July 2017, the Metro Board endorsed staff’s Strategic Plan for the transition to ZEBs. The first phase
in the Strategic Plan is to convert the Metro Orange Line to ZEBs by 2020 and the Metro Silver Line as
soon as feasible, thereafter. The second phase involves the creation of a ZE Master Plan that would
evaluate the entire Metro bus system and map out the best strategy and anticipated cost to convert to
an all-ZE operation.
Shortly after the Board’s endorsement of the 2017 Strategic Plan, Metro awarded three ZEB contracts
for the electrification of the Orange and Silver bus rapid transit (BRT) lines; two with BYD for five 60foot ZEBs intended for the Orange Line, 60 40-foot ZEBs intended for the Silver Line; and one with
New Flyer for 40 60-foot ZEBs intended for the Orange Line.
In September 2019, Metro’s Board approved exercising the options of 40 additional BYD 40-foot ZEBs.
With this exercise, Metro has plans to deploy 145 BEBs.
1.3.1

ZEB Program Master Plan

In July 2018, Metro awarded “ZEBGO” a joint venture of multiple industry experts to produce a Master
Plan and action-ready RFPs to transition to all ZEBs by 2030. As part of this plan, ZEBGO is
responsible for providing the following services:
-

Industry Outreach
Inventory of Metro Operations
Assessment of Best Industry Practices
Evaluation of Compliance with Existing Standards and Codes
Support Negotiation of Rate Structures with Utilities
Analyses/System Modeling and Phasing Options
Development of Technical Specifications for ZEBs and Facilities
Development of Action-Ready Request for Proposals (RFPs)

Metro serves as transportation planner, coordinator, designer, builder, and operator for one of the
country’s largest, most populous counties. More than 9.6 million people – nearly one-third of
California’s residents – live, work, and play within Metro’s 1,433-square-mile service area.

1.E.1.a

ZEBGO’s efforts are still ongoing and many of its findings inform the Rollout Plan. The Master Plan’s
work is iterative and will continue beyond the Rollout Plan submission deadlines. Therefore, some of
the information outlined in this report may be superseded based on technological advancements and
new information and data.
NextGen Bus Study

In 2018, Metro also began the process of restructuring existing service to better meet the needs of
current and future riders. The NextGen Bus Study will evaluate a number of alternatives and strategies
to improve service, which may include more frequent service and shorter headways. This project is in
now in the implementation phases, and its bus assignments and service blocks will be coordinated
with Metro’s ZEB Master Plan efforts.

1.4

Rollout Plan Approach

The Rollout Plan identifies a strategy for Metro to procure and operate an all-ZEB fleet by 2030 – 10
years before the ICT regulation requires. In accordance with the Rollout Plan Guidance, this document
provides an overview of a number of key components to Metro’s ZEB transition, including fleet
acquisitions, schedule, training, and funding considerations. As previously mentioned, Metro is
currently studying and has a goal of transitioning to all ZEBs by 2030. Therefore, there are no
significant concerns with meeting the ICT regulation’s 2040 requirement. Due to the rapidly evolving
nature of ZEB technologies, it is possible that the findings and recommended approaches in this report
will be outdated when it is time for implementation. For that reason, Metro continues to evaluate
technologies and strategies beyond 2030, when a fully operational ZEB fleet is anticipated. Those areas
of current study will be indicated, where applicable.
The information in this Rollout Plan is informed and based on December 2018 operations. This
information is used because it represents the fleet under typical operations. Since then, there have
been a number of special projects, including bus bridges, that may skew the fleet size and division
requirements. The Master Plan, however, will make use of the most recent information available in
anticipation of the release of the NextGen Bus Study, which will provide the foundation for the final
version of Metro’s Master Plan.
It should also be noted that COVID-19 has caused unprecedented losses in Metro’s revenue through
both the loss of ridership and a reduction in sales tax revenue. For these reasons, Metro has reduced
service and operations and is still evaluating and forecasting the long-term ramifications on the system
and the agency’s capital projects and goals. That said, how COVID-19 impacts Metro’s electrification
goals is still unclear, however, Metro will continue to proceed with planning and adjust as needed once
COVID-19 is stabilized and trends are more predictable.

FLEET AND ACQUISITIONS

2.1

Baseline Bus Fleet

As of December 2018, Metro directly operates 2,228 buses (2,555 standard bus equivalents [SBEs]).7 An
additional 165 SBEs are indirectly operated through contracted services. Metro, as the owner of these
buses, will work with contractors to ensure that these buses are replaced and that the owners of the
facilities establish plans and support infrastructure pursuant to the ICT regulation. Metro’s fleet consists
of a mixture of 40-foot, 45-foot, and 60-foot CNG buses.8 Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 presents a summary of

Technology Portfolio

Metro’s past and ongoing analysis has found that BEBs are the most suitable technology to meet ZEB
goals. This is in a large part due to the market of BEBs in terms of technological advancement, costs, and
availability. While FCEBs are promising and have many potential benefits as compared to both CNG and
BEB, unpredictability in operation costs and a limited supply chain makes it an unviable option at this
time, especially considering Metro’s aggressive ZEB goals. However, Metro will remain open for
potential future FCEB integration into its fleet.

Existing ZEB Procurements and Projects

To date, Metro has approved the procurement of 145 BEBs. Table 2-3 presents Metro’s existing BEB
procurements and Table 2-4 details Metro’s existing chargers both installed and under construction.
To support these buses, multiple enhancements have been initiated or completed at divisions and
stops that serve these lines. For instance, at Division 8, which serves the Orange Line, Metro has
coordinated with the utility, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), to add
additional electrical capacity, and ABB, a charger manufacturer, to construct 10 150-kW plug-in
chargers to support overnight and midday charging. There is also ongoing construction for on-route
chargers at three locations along the Orange Line’s route. These on-route chargers range from 450-kW
to 600-kW are based on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) pantograph charging standard,
J3105-1. The Orange Line is anticipated to be fully electrified by the end of 2020.
The Silver Line and the divisions and stations that serve it - Division 9, Division 18, and El Monte and
Harbor Gateway Transit Centers - are all currently being analyzed and designed to determine the most
suitable chargers. The Silver Line is anticipated to be electrified by 2021.

Metro has taken and is taking several steps to ensure that it is in the best position to meet the Board’s
2030 ZEB goal. As mentioned, Metro’s Board envisions the fleet transition in two phases. Phase 1 will
focus on the conversion of the Orange and Silver BRT Lines to ZEB by 2020 and 2021, respectively,
and Phase 2 will convert the rest of the fleet.

1.E.1.a

2.4

Procurement Schedule

As previously indicated, Metro also leases approximately 165 buses to contractors to provide service on
Metro routes – Metro does not own or operate the facilities where these buses are stored. That said,
Metro will continue to provide buses and coordinate with contractors as facility master plans are
developed. At this time the schedule and approach for these facilities’ upgrades are under development.
Table 2-5 summarizes Metro’s anticipated procurements through 2040. In September 2019, the Metro
Board granted approval to execute 369 bus options (40 BEB and 329 CNG) to cover Metro’s fleet needs
(pre-pandemic) until 2022. This table is built off of the assumption that BEBs/battery capacities will be
available to meet Metro’s service block ranges so that a 1:1 replacement ratio is achievable. Years 2023,
2026, and 2029, are highlighted because these indicate when Metro’s new purchases should be 25
percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent ZEB, respectively, in accordance with the ICT regulation.

Based on initial analysis, all new bus purchases will be ZEB starting in 2022 – seven years before the
ICT regulation requires. Early retirement should not be an issue pursuant to the ICT regulation based
on Metro’s future purchases, however, Metro is still evaluating strategies to avoid early retirement
pursuant to its 2030 goals.

ZEB Range Requirements and Costs

Approximately 31 percent of Metro’s bus blocks travel more than 150 miles per day – a range that
exceeds current batteries’ capabilities. To reduce impacts to service, Metro intends to apply a number
of strategies to meet service (range) requirements, including the investment in on-route chargers,
additional bus purchases, battery/charging management systems, and solar and battery storage. In
future ZEB applications, Metro will also consider FCEBs, especially if battery technology doesn’t
advance as forecasted.
2.4.2

Conversion of CNG Buses to ZEBs

A full fleet conversion to ZEBs by 2030 will require Metro to increase procurements by 848 buses. To
address the increased capital costs associated with advanced procurements, the conversion of
approximately 757 buses will be included in the procurement schedule.9 Currently, conversions are
anticipated to take place during the mid-life overhaul during the years 2027 and 2028, though this may
be refined further to evenly distribute purchases across the transition period (Table 2-6).

FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS

3.1

Facility Modifications

Metro’s transition to ZE technologies, namely, BEB, will require several modifications and
replacements to existing infrastructure and operations. This would include the decommissioning of
CNG equipment, enhancements and expansions of electrical equipment, additional electrical capacity,
and the installation of BEB gantries, chargers, dispensers, and other components. These changes will
not only occur at 10 of Metro’s directly-operated bus divisions – Division 10 will only be used for
relocations during the transition - but also at select bus layover locations and transit centers that will
function as on-route charging stations.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the location of Metro’s divisions and Table 3-1 summarizes the modifications and
schedules planned at 10 of Metro’s bus divisions.

Division Charging Strategies and Infrastructure

All divisions will support DC inverted pantograph charging. In an effort to maximize space and cost
savings via reduced demand charges, Metro is currently planning for a “one to many” 150-kW charger
to dispenser ratio (one charger to more than one buses) for overnight charging. Metro will also
integrate “fast charging lanes” at divisions to provide buses with the opportunity to “top off” during
midday pull-ins and/or during servicing before connecting to the overnight “slow” chargers. These
“fast charging lanes” will have chargers in excess of the 150-kW chargers. Individual division strategies
are still being analyzed and may vary and change based on unique operating and service conditions.
As technology develops, Metro will also consider other ratios and charging strategies which may impact
the layout of each division.
At the divisions, chargers, conduit, and associated pantographs will be supported by an overhead frame
that will cover the surface of the bus parking tracks (Figure 3-2). This overhead strategy is due to the
general constrained space at most of Metro’s divisions. BEB charging infrastructure includes a number
of charging cabinets, switches, switchgears, and transformers that require a considerable amount of
space. This general design will be at divisions to maximize space and ensure compatibility with all
procured BEBs.

On-Route Charging Strategies and Infrastructure

As mentioned, on-route charging is a consideration for Metro’s ZEB transition. On-route charging will
extend bus ranges, reduce peak demand (kW) at divisions, and serve as future-ready strategy as it is
likely that charging during the day will eventually be more cost-competitive than charging at night due
to an increasing availability of renewable power.
On-route charging facilities will also utilize DC inverted pantograph chargers. All on-route chargers
are anticipated to be “high-powered” (in excess of 150-kW) to ensure that buses can receive more
energy in a small period of time, typically during layovers. Metro is planning for up to 1.2 megawatts
(MW) of power per SAE J-3105.

On-route charging is most useful at endpoints or layover locations of trips. As of December 2018,
Metro has 529 layover locations, of these, approximately 52 are considered ideal and deemed
preliminarily feasible as on-route charging areas. These locations were based on the number of vehicles
that layover, available space (for charging equipment), and its off-street orientation – for maintenance
and safety issues, it was assumed that off-street locations would mitigate safety and vandalism issues
with the public. Staff continues to refine modeling and related analysis at these locations to determine
which ones will be candidates for implementation. It is assumed that all on-route locations will have
450 kW or greater chargers and will be pantograph-based to support Metro’s fleet. It is likely that some
of these will be at transit centers that are shared between other transit agencies. For that reason, Metro

Phasing and Construction Staging

Construction Phases

The prioritization of divisions’ conversions will be based on a number of factors, however, space
availability (i.e., divisions with more space can accept more buses on a temporary basis) is the most
critical as it directly impacts the schedule and Metro’s transition goal. It should be noted that the
strategy that Metro plans to employ for facility construction will have minimal or no impact on service.
Staff has segmented the transition schedule into three distinct phases to accomplish both Metro and
ICT requirements as presented in Table 3-2.

Phase 1 is the full electrification of Metro’s BRT services, the Orange and Silver Lines as shown in
Table 3-2. Electrical enhancements and chargers are currently being installed at Division 8, along with
on-route chargers at multiple stations. Concepts for Divisions 9 and 18 are currently under
development to serve future BEBs.

Adhering to the construction schedule and milestones will be critical because divisions’ charging
infrastructure construction and utility upgrades must be completed before buses are delivered,
otherwise, the buses will not be able to operate. The following sections describes the order in which
each division will be constructed (phased), and the work to be done on each division’s site (staging).

Phase 2 consists of the conversion of Metro’s remaining services, including all local, rapid, shuttle,
and express routes. Due to adequate on-site space or adjacent Metro property, Divisions 8, 9, 15, and
18 are considered “independent divisions” because BEB infrastructure enhancements can largely be
completed with no or minimal buses relocations. Initial work has begun on Division 9 and 18 due to
Metro’s Board approval of exercising the 40 additional BYD buses in September 2019.
Construction work will be done in stages, on-site, to allow on-going transit service and operations to
continue without interruption. Buses can be shifted around on-site to vacate areas for electrification
improvements while still operating all buses and serving all routes assigned to these divisions.
Phase 2 is illustrated in Figure 3-7.

Phase 3 continues Phase 2 conversions by focusing on the remaining local, rapid, shuttle, and express
routes. Due to space constraints, Divisions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 13 are considered “dependent divisions”
and will require portions of assigned fleets to be temporarily relocated to and operated from other
divisions to allow portions of the site to be turned over for staged construction activities. Phase 3 will
likely result in increased operational costs due to the increased deadhead miles incurred.
If one of the Phase 3 divisions is under construction while a portion of its fleet is temporarily relocated
to Division 10, no other dependent division can be improved unless additional relocation storage space
is identified and made available.

On-Site Staging

Each stage generally represents a natural break of bus parking at each division. For each stage, buses
will be relocated for approximately six months so that BEB charging equipment can be installed. At
the conclusion of the staged construction, buses can once again be parked there. Figure 3-9 provides
an example of the stages of construction at Division 9.

Due to space constraints at each division, most divisions’ ZEB infrastructure upgrades will be done in
multiple on-site “stages” which will require the temporary relocation of buses to other divisions.

1.E.1.a

Schedule and Adaptability

As previously discussed, Metro has a very aggressive ZE transition schedule. While the ICT regulation
requires a full fleet conversion by 2040, Metro is planning on converting by 2030. To maintain this
schedule, the availability of buses, construction schedule adherence, and utility enhancements will all
have to be aligned. It should also be noted that as technology develops and new data is acquired, Metro
will continue to make adjustments to maximize utility and cost feasibility. This will have direct impacts
on the implementation schedule.
Figure 3-10 presents the preliminary transition schedule. These activities include electrification,
design, and construction.

Note: Division 10 will not be retrofitted to accommodate ZEBs. Division 10 will primarily be used for temporary storage and bus relocations
during the transition.

The following sections detail the existing conditions and planned modifications for 10 of Metro’s 11
divisions. As noted previously, December 2018 service levels were used as a baseline. The number of
existing buses on-site are based on the total (regardless of active or spare, or vehicle length). All
divisions are able to accommodate at least the number of existing buses if converted to BEBs. Ongoing
analysis and bus procurements will refine these numbers based on fleet mix and the advancement of
battery technology.

Division 8

Division 8 is located at 9201 Canoga Avenue in the City of Los Angeles. 202 CNG-powered buses are
stored, maintained, fueled, and serviced at the division. Division 8’s fleet consists of 61 40-foot, 107 45foot, 33 60-foot, and one 65-foot bus. Bus parking predominates the site and buses are parked in
diagonal stacked rows in the south and west portions of the division. As part of a recent reconfiguration
of the parking, two diagonal rows have been combined to be nose-to-tail.
10 ABB 150-kW plug-in chargers will be installed on western wall of the Division. However, this work
preceded the ZEB Master Plan which is recommending a different charging strategy and layout.
Planned ZEB Modifications and Timeline
Additional electrical capacity will be required to meet the service needs of buses Division 8. Based on
preliminary demand modeling, approximately 14 MW of power will be needed to be provided by
LADWP to support the current fleet. Construction and enhancements to bring this additional capacity
is anticipated to take two to three years. It should be noted that additional capacity was installed at the
division to accommodate the 10 plug-in chargers.
To accommodate additional buses and future BEB equipment, the division is being designed for noseto-tail track parking. Construction for Division 8 and its associated BEB charging equipment and
support systems will be completed in two, six-month stages. Due to available storage capacity at
Division 8 and the adjacent Marilla Lot (Metro-owned parking lot), buses can be rearranged on site
and/or moved temporarily to Marilla Lot during construction.
Ultimately, Division 8 is expected to have 101 150-kW and three 450-kW chargers and will be BEBoperational in 2024. Figure 3-16 illustrates the process that Division 8 will undergo towards full
electrification.

45-foot, and 50 60-foot buses. Bus parking comprises the majority of the site in the south and west
portions of the division. Parking is single row diagonal and has recently been expanded into an
underutilized space.
Planned ZEB Modifications and Timeline
Additional electrical capacity will be required to meet the service needs of buses at Division 15. Based
on preliminary demand modeling, approximately 17 MW of power will be needed to be provided by
LADWP to support the current fleet. Construction and enhancements to bring this additional capacity
is anticipated to take two to three years.
Given the current layout, making room for charging equipment could be challenging but rearranging
two or more rows, as was done at Division 8, would provide ample parking space.
Construction for Division 15 and its associated BEB charging equipment and support systems will be
completed in two, six-month stages. Due to available storage capacity at Division 15 and the nearby

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

4.1

Disadvantaged Communities Served

73 percent of Metro’s divisions are located in communities that are classified as “disadvantaged”
according to CalEnviroScreen. The conversion of existing CNG operations to BEB operations will
directly benefit the communities in the vicinity of these divisions by way of a reduction in noise and
local emissions. These divisions also serve multiple routes that traverse multiple DACs across Los
Angeles County.
Table 4-1 summarizes whether or not divisions are located in DACs and the number and percentage
of DACs that its respective routes serve. Figure 4-1 illustrates Metro divisions and routes in DACs.

DAC Prioritization Strategy

Since ZEBs cannot operate unless infrastructure is in place to charge buses, Metro’s transition
(primarily Phases 2 and 3) largely focuses on division electrification and not individual routes. Once
divisions are electrified, buses will be strategically deployed to routes and service blocks with a priority
of DAC service. It should be noted that in Phase 2, three of the four divisions to be electrified divisions
are in DACs, the remaining four DAC divisions will be electrified in Phase 3.
The population that resides in DACs tend to be society’s most vulnerable. They typically rely on the
public transit system, are more likely to be impoverished, and are more frequently exposed to harmful
emissions and pollutants that result in negative health outcomes. Thus, DAC communities will benefit
the most once ZEBs are adopted and this is why Metro is making a concerted effort to ensure that
divisions and routes within and that service DACs are among the first to be transitioned to ZEBs, as
shown in Table 4-1.

WORKFORCE TRAINING

5.1

Training Requirements

The transition to ZEBs will significantly alter Metro’s service and operations. Converting to ZEBs from
CNG is an arduous endeavor and will impact all ranks of the organization. This will require extensive
change management and training which will be provided by the OEMs and Metro. Training will need
to be conducted after buses are procured and in advance of the delivery of said buses. Therefore, it is
expected that all personnel will be sufficiently trained before the buses arrive. Training conditions and
schedules will be included in procurement documents, as they are with all existing procurements. If
other OEM-provided buses are procured in the future and/or if new components, software, or protocols
are implemented, it is expected that Metro’s staff will be trained well in advance of the commissioning
of these additions. Since battery technology is rapidly evolving, it is likely that buses and supporting
battery chemistries and software will change between 2020 and 2040, therefore, Metro’s future
procurements/deliveries will require refresher or updated trainings for relevant staff.
The following provides a list of personnel and positions that will need to be retrained upon adoption
of ZEBs (this list is not exhaustive):
-

Bus Operators
Bus operators will need to be familiarized with the buses, safety, bus operations, and pantograph
operations.

-

Facilities Maintenance Staff and Maintenance
Facilities staff will need to be familiarized with scheduled and unscheduled repairs, high-voltage
systems, and the specific maintenance and repair of equipment.

-

First Responders
Local fire station staff will need to be familiarized with the new buses and supporting facilities.

-

Mechanics
Mechanics will need to be familiarized with the safety-related features and other components of
ZEBs.

-

Instructors
For both Operator Central Instruction and Maintenance, instructors will need to understand all
aspects of the transition of ZEBs to train others.

-

Service Attendants
Service attendants will become familiarized with proper charging protocol and procedures that are
ZEB-specific.

-

Management Staff
All management staff (supervisors, directors, etc.) will be familiarized with ZEB operations and
safety procedures.

COSTS AND FUNDING

6.1

Preliminary Costs

Based on preliminary estimates, Metro’s transition is expected to cost between $1.3 billion and $1.6
billion. Infrastructure will cost between $900 million and $1.4 billion. and BEBs are expected to cost
$222 million more than the conventional CNG buses. These costs only reflect capital infrastructure.
Various operations and maintenance costs, including utility, operating, and maintenance costs are still
be analyzed.

START-UP AND SCALE-UP CHALLENGES

-

-

-

-

-

-

Technological adaptation. Currently, Metro is modeling and planning for a transition based on
December 2018 service levels and existing ZEB technology. With challenging 2030 and 2040
deadlines looming, it is difficult to anticipate future technological enhancements and changes,
such as improved batteries and chargers. Slight changes in these technologies could improve bus
ranges, in turn, reducing costs. Metro (and the market) must be aware of these changes as it would
be counterproductive to invest in technologies that will soon be outdated.
Costs. Adoption of ZEBs has many benefits, including potential lifecycle cost savings. However,
the investment required for capital and change management will be very expensive. Metro will
have to be creative with funding mechanisms and sources to ensure that the transition to ZEB will
not be detrimental to its operations and service.
Market Production Factors. The ICT regulation will put a lot of pressure on OEMs to produce ZEBs
at unprecedented rates. However, it is not only California that is interested in converting to ZEBs.
These multi-state policy changes will have a great impact on these transitions; however, it will also
make it challenging to meet ZEB goals for agencies if supply of buses can meet with demand.
Phasing and Transition. Metro has the second largest transit fleet in the United States.
Transitioning to ZEBs without any service interruptions will be very challenging due to the limited
space for construction, staging buses, and maintaining service.
Utility Upgrades. Metro’s divisions are currently under the jurisdiction of two utilities, whereas
potential on-route charging locations are under nine. These utilities have different rate structures and
protocols to apply for and receive additional power. How each utility is sanctioned (whether municipal
or private) also dictates procedural requirements. These nuances will make it challenging to plan for
due to the variances in schedule and process.
Managing Power Demand. The transition to BEBs will require strategies to ensure that Metro can
utilize power in the most cost-efficient way. Metro is currently doing this via utility negotiations
and demand modeling to determine methods to reduce peak demands. However, shaving demand
may also come at a hefty capital cost, something that staff is currently analyzing.
Uncertainty of COVID-19. COVID-19 has impacted all facets of our global economy, transit is not
an exclusion. During the pandemic, ridership has plummeted and caused major shortfalls in
Metro’s budget which has impacted capital programs and operations. At this time, it is unclear
what short- and long-term impacts will be for service. There is a possibility that service ridership
levels may not return to previous levels resulting in changes to procurement and funding. Metro
will continue to analyze trends to determine service changes and plans.

In conclusion, Metro is still determining the path forward towards its transition goals. At this time,
Metro is slated to convert its entire fleet to ZEBs by 2030, 10 years in advance of what is required by
the ICT. Metro’s next steps in this process is to continue refining analysis and Master Planning efforts.

regulation requires. To meet both deadlines, there are several challenges and opportunities that Metro
has identified. The following briefly described some of the challenges that Metro faces for its transition:

San Francisco Commits To All-Electric Bus Fleet By 2035
Mayor Mark Farrell and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), which operates Muni, today announced San Francisco’s commitment to
have an all-electric bus fleet by 2035. This means that the SFMTA will only purchase all-electric buses starting in 2025 to meet the goal for 2035. An all-electric
bus does not use fuel and relies solely on the battery within its operating system.

The SFMTA Board of Directors today approved a resolution supporting the commitment towards an all-electric bus fleet. Muni currently operates the largest fleet
of zero emissions electric trolley buses. Trolley buses, like all light rail, streetcar, and cable car vehicles, run on 100 percent greenhouse gas-free Hetch Hetchy
electricity via overhead wires. Muni also runs a fleet of low emissions electric hybrid vehicles. The electric hybrid vehicles run on battery, as well as clean,
renewable diesel.
“We are excited about the possibility that by 2035 we will be able to provide an all-electric fleet that won’t require overhead wires,” said Cheryl Brinkman,
Chairman of the SFMTA Board of Directors. “As an agency, we have always been forward thinkers when it comes to greening our fleet and we will continue to take
steps to test electric vehicles here in San Francisco to reach our goal.”
The SFMTA has been rolling out new electric hybrid buses with higher capacity on-board battery systems. The increased on-board battery capacity will allow the
SFMTA to run a test program to operate “Green Zones” along several electric hybrid routes that would run only by battery for significant portions of the route. The
“Green Zone” signifies an area in which the vehicle will not produce any emissions. The SFMTA is working to identify these zones throughout the city.
“Muni's transit system is the cornerstone of our city's environmentally sustainable transportation system and is one of the greenest in the world,” said Ed Reiskin,
SFMTA’s Director of Transportation. “Our efforts to take our fleet to the next level won’t only make for better and more efficient service, but they will continue the
work we are doing to be one of the cleanest fleets in the country and improve rider experience.”
The SFMTA is at the ready to move forward with electric bus technology when manufacturers can prove their electric buses can withstand heavy ridership and
steep hills. The agency would also have to consider new facilities that can charge a large fleet and developing a systemwide infrastructure to charge vehicles in
service or on the street. John Haley, SFMTA’s Transit Director said, “While the battery technology is emerging rapidly, it isn’t quite ready for primetime.
Manufacturers aren’t yet producing the number of all-electric buses San Francisco and other urban areas would need, nor could we guarantee that the vehicles
would work for the required 15 years with heavy ridership and challenging topography.”
In 2019, the SFMTA intends to purchase a limited number of zero-emission battery electric buses and test them in service throughout San Francisco to evaluate
how they perform on crowded and hilly routes. The most important step to support the zero-emission goal is to determine the infrastructure needs for electric
buses, including upgrades for our existing facilities to accommodate charging requirements and maintenance.
Of the nearly 900 all-electric buses purchased across the country, only 207 are actually in service. By contrast, Muni is currently operating 250 electric trolley
vehicles.
In recent years, the SFMTA has replaced over 90 percent of its older diesel buses with cleaner, more efficient electric hybrid vehicles that run on renewable diesel.
These electric hybrid vehicles offer dramatically lower fuel consumption, decreased engine idling time while in service, and a substantial reduction in emissions.
The SFMTA’s switch from conventional diesel to electric hybrid vehicles has reduced consumption of fuel by 5.4 million gallons and 82,000 tons of CO2 over the
12-year life of the fleet.
Over 50 percent of the transit fleet, including light rail, cable cars, historic streetcars and electric trolley buses are largely powered by greenhouse gas-free
hydropower generated from Hetch Hetchy. Beyond that, our new electric hybrid buses use 100 percent renewable fuel. This eliminates greenhouse gas emissions
and petroleum fuel and saves a million gallons of fuel each year. San Francisco’s transportation sector generates approximately 46 percent of the City’s total
greenhouse gas emissions mostly generated by the use of private cars and commercial trucks. By contrast, Muni carries 26 percent of all trips in the city, but
accounts for less than two percent of these emissions.
On April 19, 2018, in celebration of Earth Day, Mayor Mark Farrell committed San Francisco to net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, a move that will
eliminate the City’s carbon footprint.

“San Francisco is proud to once again lead on sustainable initiatives that not only improve our city, but improve the world,” said Mayor Farrell. “This new
investment represents a bold shift in how we move hundreds of thousands of people on public transit, while reaffirming San Francisco’s commitment to
sustainable energy practices.”

Achieving a zero‐emission mobility future is essential to King County Metro's core values of safety,
equity and sustainability. By protecting our air and water, reducing congestion, and expanding
accessibility and opportunity, we will create even more walkable and rollable communities that support
health and help everyone achieve their potential.
In 2019, our region’s transit network helped take the equivalent of more than 190,000 cars off the road
each day and prevented roughly 700,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2020 Strategic
Climate Action Plan (SCAP) and the Metro Strategic Plan, Metro pledged to do even more to address the
climate crisis countywide and in the fleet Metro operates. Metro committed to:




Reduce car trips and increase transit ridership to reduce the 6.1 million tons of greenhouse
gases emitted annually in King County from passenger vehicles by investing where needs are
greatest; providing fast, reliable, and integrated mobility services; and supporting transit‐
oriented develop countywide.
Transition to a zero‐emission fleet powered by renewable energy by 2035 to eliminate the
100,000 tons of greenhouse gases emitted annually by Metro’s bus fleet.

Metro’s climate goals promote the agency’s vision to deliver a regional, innovative, and integrated
mobility network that is safe, equitable and sustainable. Since 2016, King County Executive Dow
Constantine has directed Metro to transition to a zero‐emission fleet as efficiently as possible. In 2017,
Metro committed to transition to a zero‐emission fleet by 2040 so long as vehicle and charging
technology meets Metro’s current and future service needs, charging infrastructure meets our standard
operations, renewable energy supplies are secured, safety is maintained, staff are trained, and costs of
transitioning are monitored to ensure that incremental costs do not limit Metro’s ability to deliver and
expand service. The 2019 King County Council “Jump Start” legislation accelerated Metro’s initial
commitment from 2040 to 2035, with the stated intent to “reduce the overall carbon emissions from
transportation as quickly as possible while achieving the goals of Metro Connects.” In 2021, to support
its policy updates, Metro’s analysis found that the agency can achieve the greatest emission reductions
from investments in alternative fuels (e.g., renewable diesel), high frequency transit, transit‐supporting
land use (e.g., RapidRide plus transit‐oriented development) and transitioning to a zero‐emission bus
fleet.
Transitioning to a zero‐emission fleet by expanding the battery‐electric bus fleet and retaining electric
trolley buses, in complement with an integrated mobility system and transit‐supportive land use, are the
foundations of King County’s portfolio strategy to reduce transportation‐related greenhouse gas
emissions. By investing in transit service where the needs are greatest and prioritizing the scaled‐up
deployment of zero‐emissions buses in south King County where communities have been
disproportionately affected by air pollution, Metro is advancing equity.

Executive Summary: A Zero‐Emission Vision

1.E.1.a

To support a 100 percent zero‐emissions fleet by 2035, Metro will use a phased approach to
 Acquire battery‐electric buses
 Build the necessary charging infrastructure and supportive information technology
 Convert transit operations
 Train and recruit the workforce
Key milestones are identified in Figure 1 and listed under ‘Key Transition Steps’ below.
Metro develops a long‐term fleet plan to identify bus purchases by year that takes into account planned
service, and bus type, age, and size. Metro will transition its fleet to zero‐emission by replacing hybrid
buses as they are retired with battery‐electric buses. All bus purchases from 2024 onward will be zero‐
emission. Based on the fleet plan, Metro identifies the infrastructure needed to support the fleet. Metro
will provide the necessary infrastructure with both new construction and renovation of existing facilities.

King County Metro has established a goal of achieving a zero‐emissions bus fleet powered by renewable
energy by 2035. The following transition plan identifies the steps Metro will take in the near term as
well as its longer‐term strategy for achieving a zero‐emission bus fleet. This goal will be met through a
combination of battery‐electric buses (BEBs) and zero‐emission trolley buses (trolleys). This plan is
intended to satisfy a recent FTA requirement for including a Transition Plan along with any application
for funding of zero‐emission fleets or supportive infrastructure and to help guide Metro’s planning and
investment strategies as we move toward our zero‐emission goal.
The FTA identified the following requirements to be included in the Transition Plan:
1. Demonstrate a long‐term fleet management plan with a strategy for how the applicant intends to
use the current request for resources and future acquisitions. (Section 1: Fleet and Procurement)
2. Address the availability of current and future resources to meet costs for the transition and
implementation. (Section 8: Financial Resources)
3. Consider policy and legislation impacting relevant technologies.
4. Include an evaluation of existing and future facilities and their relationship to the technology
transition. (Section 2: Facilities and Infrastructure)
5. Describe the partnership of the applicant with the utility or alternative fuel provider. (Section 4:
Utility Partnerships)
6. Examine the impact of the transition on the applicant’s current workforce by identifying skill gaps,
training needs, and retraining needs of the existing workers of the applicant to operate and maintain
zero‐emission vehicles and related infrastructure and avoid displacement of the existing workforce.
(Section 7: Workforce)

Background
Department Overview: King County Metro is among the ten largest transit agencies in the United
States, with nearly 1,400 buses and 157 routes1. Pre‐Covid, Metro’s system reached more than 1500
buses2 and 215 routes. Metro operates a diverse service profile, including local bus routes, RapidRide
(bus rapid transit), vanpools and rideshare, ADA paratransit (Access) vans, and marine routes. In 2019,
before the pandemic, Metro served a daily average of 332,000 bus passengers.3 Ridership dipped during
the pandemic but is on the upswing. The bus fleet includes diesel‐hybrids, electric trolleys, and battery‐
electric buses (BEB). Fifty‐five percent of Metro’s current buses are 60‐foot, articulated buses. The non‐
bus revenue fleets include more than 1,100 active vanpool and rideshare vehicles and the ADA
paratransit program, Access, which includes nearly 400 active vehicles.
Metro has a history of taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2004, Metro became
an early adopter of diesel‐hybrid buses. Originally starting service in 1940, Metro renewed its
commitment to the trolley fleet by purchasing 174 new zero‐emission trolley buses in 2015. The trolley
and diesel‐hybrid fleets have reduced the agency’s GHG emissions and supported Metro’s climate goals.
Metro was also an early adopter of battery electric buses with the purchase of 11 Proterras in 2016.
Metro is continuing this commitment as it looks to add more battery‐electric buses and continue its
operation of trolleys on its path toward a fully zero‐emission bus fleet.

Introduction

1.E.1.a

Metro has been progressing towards a zero‐emission fleet since its initial commitment in 2017. Metro’s
plan to reach zero‐emission by 2035 includes both trolley and BEB buses. Our fleet today includes 174
zero‐emission trolleys and 21 battery‐electric buses (11 Proterra and 10 extended‐range New Flyer
buses), with the remainder being diesel‐electric hybrids. Between now and 2035, Metro will replace
diesel‐electric hybrids with BEBs as buses are ready for retirement, as shown in Figure 3. By 2035, its
fully zero‐emission fleet will have just more than 1,400 buses, per Metro’s current fleet plan. As
described below, Metro develops a fleet plan based on projected service. With the impacts of COVID‐19,
Metro’s current fleet plan forecasts minimal fleet growth in the near term. If service and ridership
projections increase more than the current projection, this could also increase the demand for fleet.

Fleet Planning
To guide Metro’s fleet management and infrastructure planning, Metro develops a long‐term fleet plan.
The fleet plan considers planned service and bus type, age and size to identify bus purchases by year.
Metro will transition its fleet to zero‐emission by replacing hybrid buses as they are retired with battery‐
electric buses. All bus purchases from 2024 onward will be zero‐emission.
Bus purchases based on the latest fleet plan which projects the types and timing of purchase of new
vehicles ‐ is represented in Table 1. The fleet plan is regularly evaluated through Metro’s Fleet Steering
Committee.

Near Term Bus Purchases
Metro has recently started taking delivery of an order of 40 extended range New Flyer BEBs (twenty 40‐
foot and twenty 60‐foot). As of the writing of this plan, 10 buses had arrived, with the remainder
expected to arrive over the course of the year. All 40 extended‐range BEBs are expected to be fully
entered into service by the end of 2022. These buses will operate from South Base Test Facility, which
was commissioned in spring 2022 (and described more in Section 2). These extended‐range buses
supplement the initial 11 short‐range BEBs launched on the Eastside of King County. The short‐range
BEBs are supported with proprietary charging infrastructure at the Eastgate park‐and‐ride and Bellevue
Base.
In 2025, Metro will receive 120 BEBs to operate from Interim Base. In 2028, the next 250 BEBs will arrive
to operate out of the new South Annex Base. In the following years, Metro will continue to replace its
remaining diesel‐hybrids with BEBs through 2035, as buses age and charging infrastructure is built both
at operating bases and at layover charging facilities.

Trolleys
Metro has successfully operated a zero‐emissions trolley program since 1939. Currently, the trolley fleet
comprises approximately 12 percent of the total fleet and carries about 15 percent of riders4. The
trolleys run exclusively in Seattle and continue to be an integral part of Metro’s system.
Metro plans to grow its electric trolley fleet in 2027, from 174 to 204 coaches, with the purchase of an
additional thirty trolleys. Metro is considering opportunities for strategic expansion and enhancement of
the trolley system. In addition, Metro is planning to upgrade the trolley battery systems on the existing
fleet as the current batteries reach the end of their useful life. Upgraded batteries will improve off‐wire
capabilities and provide flexibility to enable the trolleys to navigate construction zones and other
blockages. Metro is also planning to replace its existing trolley fleet when it reaches retirement age in
about 2033.

Early Short Range Proterra Fleet
In 2016, as Metro was first exploring battery bus technology, we purchased three first‐generation,
rapid‐charge, Proterra buses followed by a purchase of eight second‐generation Proterra buses in 2018.
These buses have a range of approximately 25 miles.
Metro evaluated competitive vendor proposals and chose to work with Proterra because, at the time,
they had deployed the most electric buses in North America. Currently, these buses are in revenue
service for two routes, 226 and 241, supported by both layover charging, at Eastgate park‐and‐ride, and
base charging at Metro’s Bellevue Base. Eastgate has three chargers on a single gantry with capacity for

1.E.1.a

As late as 2018, the electrical dispenser mechanism developed by Proterra, and used by the Eastside
routes 226 and 241, known as infrastructure‐mounted blade charging (“blade charging”), was being
considered as a standard by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)13 J‐3105 standards committee
(see Section ”Procurement Strategy and Standards,” following) for more information on SAE
standards).However, in the final published standard, blade charging was not included.
The SAE standards adopted in January 2020 have been incorporated in Metro’s procurement
documents. Metro expects to continue to use the Proterra blade‐charging buses in revenue service for
the next decade at a minimum because the infrastructure exists and there is no need for replacement
until the electrification of Bellevue Base occurs.

Testing Zero‐Emission Technology
Bus technology has evolved since Metro’s initial investment in the short‐range Proterra buses. With the
development of extended range BEBs, the newer technology provided options for fleet procurements
that could better meet Metro’s operational needs. To help inform future purchases and to better
understand the technology, Metro completed testing of 10 extended range battery‐electric buses,
manufactured by BYD, New Flyer, and Proterra. The 10 test buses included 40‐ft buses and 60‐ft
articulated buses, two per length (40‐ft or 60‐ft), and per OEM5. Testing was conducted to verify the
140‐mile range and performance specifications with various loads, terrain, and weather conditions. One
of each length was operated with passengers. The buses, batteries, and charge facilities were leased.
During the summer and fall, the buses performed at or above expectations. More testing is required to
gain additional experience with revenue service and operation in cold weather. The testing helped
Metro staff learn more about the technology and complete updates and revisions to training
requirements and documentation. It also informed purchasing and procurement specifications.
Prior to the bus test, Metro determined that overhead, pantograph down charging was the best option
because it provided the most efficient and safest power transfer method available in the industry while
keeping the weight of the buses down. (See further discussion in the ‘Procurement Strategy and
Standards’ section). This decision was based on analysis of various charging methods and will provide
the basis for base design and conversion moving forward.
Metro also developed a concept of a test charging facility to allow assessment of different charging
options, discussed further in Section 2.

engineers and technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries whose
core competencies include standards development through consensus. Establishing technical standards

total of 10.

five chargers, the first of its kind in North America. These buses provide valuable information regarding
electricity use and utility charges and allow Metro operators, mechanics, and riders to experience the
technology.

are for the purpose of advancing quality, safety, and innovation in these industries. The organization has
established more than 37,000 standards in their history. In a rapidly changing field such as electric
vehicle technology, standards serve to establish baseline attributes of various systems (such as charging
systems) that enable a level of standardization to facilitate commercial adoption while the industry
continues to evolve. The SAE standards denoted in this document were agreed to by all North American
bus manufacturers, including Proterra, and will be used for procurement documents to ensure
consistency and interoperability exists between chargers, charge dispensers and buses.
When the 2017 Metro feasibility study was released, the North America bus charging standards were
not finalized. Charging standards were called out in the 2017 study as a key requirement to support the
battery‐electric bus industry.
Currently, there are two proposed standards—plug‐in charging (SAE J1772 CCS‐1), and automated (SAE
3105) which includes pantograph down charging (SAE J3105‐1), pantograph up charging (SAE J3105‐2),
and pin and socket (SAE J3105‐3). The last two have not yet been deployed in North America. The
former, SAE J3105‐1 has a few hundred deployments including Seattle, Los Angeles, New York City and
other major transit agencies. After review and approval through the Zero‐ Emissions Bus Program
governance structure, Metro is recommending purchase of buses using the pantograph down charging
standard, SAE J3105‐1, for multiple reasons. All North American bus manufacturers have experience
building to this standard. It lessens the weight on the bus because the bus carries minimal charging
hardware; a lower weight bus allows for greater range and longer battery life. This charging system
places all responsibility for charger connection on the technology and not on the operator through the
standard’s hardware, communication, and geo‐positioning mechanism. Additionally, fleet maintenance
prefers the pantograph down standard because it lessens bus maintenance. Plug‐ in charging ports (SAE
J1772 CCS‐1) will be available for maintenance needs and on road recovery if necessary.

Bus Batteries
With the expansion of Metro’s electrified fleet, there will be an increasing need to ensure the continued
safe and proper handling of the bus batteries once they have reached the end of their service life. Since
this usually happens once or twice before the vehicle frame itself reaches end‐of‐life, there is a need for
a process to handle battery packs separate from their on‐vehicle housings. Such a process is already in
place for the high voltage batteries coming from Metro’s fleet of hybrid buses, with some batteries
being recycled and others being reused based upon battery chemistry, market conditions, and safety
requirements. However, there are indications that disposal of batteries and fire protection storage costs
will increase in the upcoming years. To improve this system and accommodate additional battery
quantities, chemistries and configurations, Metro is working with partners, such as the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory and the NAATBatt6 trade association.
Metro is also exploring various other strategies such as OEMs take‐back and in‐house stationary power
applications.
There will be increasing opportunities to partner with utilities around demand response to further lower
electrical bills. IT will continue to evolve with the final goal of a fully integrated system that both

1.E.1.a

Battery‐electric bus technology is dynamic; the solutions Metro develops today are expected to be
scalable, but Metro anticipates there will be changes as the technology matures and Metro better
understands how to deploy and manage zero‐ emissions buses. Metro needs to continually evolve its
battery‐electric bus program to ensure it is scalable, innovative, and sustainable while still providing
service at the highest levels and improving on current practices. The next two decades will be a time of
tremendous change and growth for both for Metro and battery‐electric technology. Enhancements in
energy and power density will improve Metro’s operational capability and resiliency.
Additionally, there are trade‐offs to consider with battery size and charging strategy. Strategic use of
layover charging can help support buses with smaller batteries. These trade‐offs are discussed further in
Section 3, under ‘Layover Charging and Bus Battery Size’.

2. Facilities and Infrastructure
Supporting battery‐electric buses will take both electrified base facilities to park, charge and maintain
buses and on‐route charging infrastructure to provide charging in the field. The base facilities will come
from both new facilities and conversions of existing facilities. This section describes the facilities planned
to support the fleet plan. Figure 7, later in this section, shows an overlay of the facility planning and the
fleet plan.

New Base Construction
Metro has begun building new facilities with large‐scale electrical charging infrastructure. Metro is also
developing information technology (IT) solutions for charge management and route planning. The first
focus is on South Campus as shown in Figure 4. South Campus includes the South Base Test Facility,
Interim Base and South Annex Base.
South Base Test Facility. The South Base Test Facility (SBTF) was recently commissioned to support the
initial 40 BEBs arriving this year. This facility was designed to enable testing of equipment from multiple
vendors in multiple configurations to inform design of future infrastructure and test interoperability. It
also provides training opportunities. A diagram and further description of South Base Test Facility is on
the following page.
Interim Base. The newly constructed Interim Base at South Campus (Interim Base) will be electrified in
2025. The electrification of Interim Base involves the design and electrification to support 120 battery
electric bus. Interim Base is intended as a prototype for future battery‐electric bus deployment and base
electrification. Metro expects there will be lessons learned and changes that will refine Metro processes
and base design as electrification occurs across the bases and fleet.
South Annex Base. South Annex Base at South Campus (South Annex Base) will be in operation as an
electrified base in 2028 with capacity for 250 BEBs.

In the next decade as charger software develops, Metro can deploy new or upgraded charge
management software in this controlled environment removed, from base charging
infrastructure. Like all software upgrades, adequate testing in an environment localized to a
non‐essential facility is key to success.
It serves as a facility for the development of training and maintenance practices and for sharing
Metro’s learnings with others as a leader in the industry.

What’s learned from SBTF will inform the planning for the charging infrastructure at future facilities.

infrastructure:

Interoperability ensures that products from different bus and charger manufacturers work together and allows
Metro to purchase buses and chargers based on quality and cost of a product. This limits dependence on a single
manufacturer and reduces risk of relying on technology that may become obsolete.

1.E.1.a

Metro has also begun planning for the conversion of its
existing bases to support battery‐electric buses which
will be a critical part of the transition. Metro owns and
operates seven existing bus bases across King County.
Metro plans to convert its bases sequentially with each
base expected to take between 18 and 24 months for
conversion depending on the size and complexity. As
bases are closed for conversion, the overall system
capacity will be impacted temporarily. Additionally,
there will a permanent reduction in capacity of 10‐15
percent due to the installation of charging
infrastructure within the yards.
The plan to convert bases seeks to balance
construction efficiency with the ability to maintain
operations. Figure 7 shows the projected conversion
schedule, fleet projection and system capacity. Given
our current fleet size, once Interim Base and South
Annex Base are completed, there should be enough
system capacity to enable the shutdown of bases
necessary to allow conversion while still supporting
operations.

Order of Conversion: Balancing System Capacity
and Stable Operations
The order in which Metro plans to convert its bases
was determined based on capacity, risk versus benefit,
and funding. Metro plans to shut down each facility
during the conversion process which will affect
between 7 and 17 percent of total system capacity
depending on the base that is shut down. Additional
concurrent impacts to base operations such as
necessary maintenance and potential impact from
Sound Transit construction activities and other entities
must be considered as well. Timing and extent of
power grid capacity work could also impact the final
schedule and sequence of the base conversion. There
will also be permanent capacity loss post‐conversion
due to the added infrastructure in the yard which must Figure 4: Metro Existing Bus Base Locations
be considered to avoid dipping into unstable
operations.

3. Charging Strategy
Charging infrastructure is comprised of an electrical connection component (plug/socket),
communications (antenna), IT (software) and a structural component. For Metro’s preferred charging
method, the structural component is a concrete base, steel truss gantry that holds the charging heads
and the connection to the bus. Metro has chosen to use a pantograph down system.
Attached to the pantograph, through electrical wiring, are contact bars that dispense the electricity.
There are various manufacturers building charge heads. Depending on the charger manufacturer
chosen, the footprint required for the cabinets and switchgear will vary.

Figure 8. High-level charging infrastructure schematic
North American transit agencies are moving towards a mixed approach to electrical infrastructure
consisting of both on base charging as well as on route charging.8 It is worth noting another change in
technology that occurred since the 2017 Study. At that time, charging and fleet types were viewed as
distinct, either slow or fast charge options. Now BEB battery types and charging have converged to allow
for both charging options within the same bus. In general, the industry is moving to having most of the
charging located on bases with low‐power, overnight charging. However, for longer blocks of work,
layover charging locations are available. At layover locations buses charge during regularly scheduled
driver breaks. This approach does not keep batteries in a full state of charge but provides enough energy
to allow the batteries to complete blocks of work and return to base for most charging.

Metro’s BEB Strategic Program Manager regularly meets with other transit agencies developing BEB programs
and most are pursuing a strategy of base and on route/layover charging.

Metro’s internal testing has shown that the 60‐foot extended‐range battery‐electric buses can reliably
support a 140‐mile range based on the topography and climate conditions of our region. This 140‐mile
range supports approximately 70 percent of our routes (blocks of work) under our current system
design, leaving 30 percent of our service needing a solution to extend their range. To support more
frequent service and longer routes such as many of the RapidRide routes, Metro plans to develop “On‐
route” or layover charging. Layover charging stations will ideally be located at park‐and‐rides and other
layover locations to take advantage of operator break time to partially recharge the bus without having
to return the vehicle to base.

Increasing Resiliency and Flexibility
Layover charging extends the range a bus can go without having to return to a base and adds resiliency
and flexibility into the system. Layover chargers will provide options and will be valuable for buses as
batteries age and when weather impacts battery performance. Additionally, layover chargers distribute
load and electrical infrastructure over a larger area which increases resiliency. They also increase
flexibility by supporting the operations of routes from different bases, which will be valuable as routes
are shifted between bases during conversion to electrification.

Layover Charging and Bus Battery Size
Incorporating layover charging into the system will influence the size of batteries needed on a bus. The
decision regarding battery‐pack sizing versus layover charging is a balance. The battery‐pack must be
large enough to support all blocks of work. However, an overly large battery is expensive and heavy.
Batteries also deteriorate over time and lose range. Building layover charging infrastructure strategically
throughout the County will increase operational efficiency by enabling buses to charge as needed during
scheduled layovers. This strategy also allows Metro to purchase the smallest battery packs needed to
support these blocks of work, thereby reducing the cost and weight of the bus. Battery packs must be
large enough however to support sufficient range ‐ short‐range BEBs such as our first 11 Proterras for
example are very limited in where than can be used in our system. An additional benefit to
incorporating layover charging is resiliency – if one charging location is unavailable, the layover sites
provide alternate locations to charge the buses and, as batteries degrade and require more charging,
the layover locations can be used more frequently to support the ranges these buses need to meet.
North American transit agencies have begun settling on civil infrastructure to support charging.
Generally, large, North American transit agencies like Los Angeles Metro, New York City Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, and the Chicago Transit Authority are designing charging infrastructure with
an overhead bridge‐like structure (gantry), like that at the Eastgate park‐and‐ride. This system allows for
either higher or lower powered charging and provides operational efficiency for bases because, unlike
plug‐in charging, there are no cords to manage. At layover locations, either a gantry or mast‐style can be
used.9 Metro will be building overhead gantry charging infrastructure at its bases and layover locations
to support BEBs.

Metro is pursuing five initial layover sites in
South King County to support Interim and
South Annex Base electrification. These
initial sites have been selected to leverage
work that is underway, primarily as Sound
Transit is building new or upgrading existing
transit centers related to Link light rail
construction and ST BRT investments. The
initial sites include South Renton Transit
Center, Kent Station, Kent/Des Moines, the
Federal Way Transit Center and King County
owned Burien Transit Center.
Metro is also in the process of identifying
what locations are the best candidates for
layover charging across the system. A study
currently underway is taking a closer look at
Metro’s service network as well as layover
locations and other potential hubs.

Working with Others
Layover charging will require coordination
and partnerships with others, including
Sound Transit owned
King County owned
jurisdictions, utilities, other transit agencies
and the private sector. Layover charging will
Figure 9. South King County Planned Layover Charging Locations
need significant electrical infrastructure in
multiple jurisdictions throughout the County. It will also require physical space, either at off‐street
locations such as park‐and‐rides and other transit hubs or possibly within public right of way.
Jurisdiction support and partnership in developing charging infrastructure will be critical. Jurisdictions
will play a role in permitting, zoning codes and standards and can facilitate on‐route charging
development. Additionally, support and guidance for infrastructure development at the state level could
also help facilitate. Partnering with other transit agencies such as Sound Transit who also own key
terminal locations in King County may create efficiencies through shared charging stations. There could
also be opportunities for public‐private partnerships with companies such as Microsoft, Amazon or
others as the private sector also explores electrification.
Metro is a leader and active participant in activities with other transit agencies and industry
organizations such as the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) in developing standards and sharing information. We have also cooperated with utilities
and the University of Washington on conducting studies, sharing data and supporting grant applications
and retired batteries. We are also coordinating with local technical training programs at local colleges to
help prepare Metro’s future workers to maintain and operate our electric vehicles and charging
infrastructure.

1.E.1.a

As Metro moves forward with the battery‐electric bus program, one of the keys for success is
negotiating an appropriate tariff with the utilities. Metro buses operate inboth Seattle City Light (SCL)
and Puget Sound Energy (PSE) territory. Interim Base and South Annex Base are in Seattle City Light
territory. Metro is actively engaging with both utilities on tariff rates but is initially focused on Seattle
City Light because of the nearer term projects. Figure 10 shows the service areas of Seattle City Light
and Puget Sound Energy.

Figure 10. Service areas of Puget Sound Energy and Seattle City Light
In general terms, monthly electricity bills resulting from vehicle charging typically include fixed costs,
energy costs, demand costs, and taxes and fees. First, there is a fixed or minimum cost that is applied
per meter regardless of the amount of electricity used. Second, there is the actual cost of energy
(commonly called “usage”) which is calculated by applying a rate per kWh to the total kWh’s used by the
chargers to replenish the batteries in a given month. Third, utilities typically assess a demand charge,
which is applied per kW based on the maximum power drawn by the chargers (also commonly called
“load” or “demand”) within a given time period each month. Depending on the type of tariff structure,
different energy and/or demand rates may apply based on time of day (peak versus off‐peak periods).
Furthermore, these peak periods may change based on season of the year. Finally, taxes and fees are
assessed. There can be several individual fees, some of which are based on usage and others based on
demand.

Packet Pg. 107

1.E.1.a

Utility Readiness

Seattle City Light has conducted a system impact study for Interim Base. Seattle City Light has two
electrical feeders that are accessible for service. Feeder A runs north/south on the west side of E
Marginal Way S and Feeder B runs north/south on the east side of E Marginal Way S. Feeder A can
handle the additional load required for Interim Base without any required system modifications. Feeder
B is not a viable feeder to support Interim Base. Seattle City Light can support the needs of Interim Base
with no significant infrastructure work to the feeders. However, Metro is working with the utility on the
best redundancy and resiliency plan. Additionally, Metro will continue to have diesel‐hybrid buses
running out of the South Base in the near term, which can be used if electrical charging fails or if power
outages occur that impact to the ability to provide service.

Power Resiliency
A battery‐electric bus operating plan must allow for service delivery when there are power outages that
last beyond the battery storage capacity. For Interim Base before our system if fully electrified, diesel‐
hybrids will replace battery‐electric buses until power is restored if there is a power failure. In the longer
term, Metro must engage thought leaders and emergency management expertise in designing power
resiliency for this new operating model. Resiliency options should extend beyond the local power utility,
including on‐base solar power, multiples substations or large battery storage banks of reserve energy.
Another challenge is the resilience required for an extended time, such as natural or humanmade
disasters that extend power outages for a prolonged period as the local power utility is trying to recover
their systems. Public transportation is typically a critical infrastructure in the times of natural disasters,
not only for regular or amended service, but also as warming coaches, evacuation and relocation, triage
and emergency transport. A discussion has begun with Seattle City Light about power restoration to
Metro in cases of catastrophic failure. Over the upcoming months, conversations need to occur with
local and county emergency managers to discuss how a potentially electric fleet may change their
expectations for major incidents and disaster support to improve recovery services.

5. Information Technology: Charge Management and Other Investments
Metro is working with various internal and external groups on information technology (IT) investments
to support electrification. Technology infrastructure is essential to support fleet electrification. The
battery charge infrastructure can be used to charge individual coaches, but an overall charge
management system is critical to driving efficient fleet charging.

Charge Management
A charge management system (CMS) is a software/firmware/hardware system that provides control
mechanisms over the amount of power being deployed by the charge heads. This system can prevent
unnecessary fees by the utilities, and efficiently manage power to batteries while communicating with
the utility to avoid peak demand or grid instability. At its most basic, a charge management system can
be deployed at the charger level; the charger is prevented from providing above a preset amount of
power, thus preventing multiple chargers from charging at high levels and triggering demand fees.

Utility readiness is a critical component of Metro’s path to electrification. Metro will work with the
utilities to assess readiness on a site‐by site basis.

15
Packet Pg. 108

1.E.1.a

The charge management system needs to take into consideration:
Minimizing electricity rates that fluctuate throughout the day based on demand
Requirements for coach charge depending upon vehicle assignment
The age of the equipment (older batteries are less efficient)

Charge Management and Layover Charging
When Metro first purchased BEBs, the industry standard was short‐range, fast‐charging buses like the 11
Proterra buses currently serving the Eastside. Use of the Proterra buses requires layover (i.e., on route),
higher‐powered chargers installed at Eastgate park‐and‐ride to ensure batteries have enough range to
complete the service profile without returning to the base to charge (see Error! Reference source not
found. below). If not properly
managed through a CMS, higher‐
power charging at layover facilities
will lead to unnecessarily high
electrical bills.10 The CMS collects
data from chargers and batteries at a
centralized location and can
determine if certain charge locations
are approaching electrical load limits
that lead to fees from the utility. The
software can automatically lower or
stop power levels to buses that do
not require charging (i.e., batteries
with enough charge to complete
Figure 6: Eastgate park‐and‐ride charging
assigned work) and prioritize buses
that require the most charging.
Layover charging without CMS controls leads to buses charging in brief spurts all day and at times of
peak electrical demand, like the evening, which could result in extra costs. Additionally, with small
battery‐pack buses, routes are limited. Smaller battery packs can only support charging on lower
mileage routes and on routes where charging can be accommodated every 25 miles (i.e., routes would
have to be adjusted to accommodate the range of small battery‐packs, which hinders operational
efficiency). Recently, transit agencies and bus OEMs have begun moving towards large battery‐pack,
slower‐charging buses. These buses charge overnight at lower power, and the large battery packs allow
for longer ranges. While on‐base charging lowers electricity costs, the current battery packs do not have
the range to support all service profiles without some midday charging.

Vehicle Data
Currently, Metro collects vehicle performance, mileage, and fault code data for its buses through a
Vehicle Information Box (“VIB”). This data interfaces with the current M5 Asset Management
maintenance database (“M5”), updating mileage information and identifying potential repair codes and
maintenance needs.

As battery‐electric buses are launched, vehicle performance, mileage and fault code data will interface
with M5 and the replacement Enterprise Asset Management system through data loggers that will also
provide data elements that are specific to battery‐electric bus vehicles, such as State of Charge (“SoC”)
and evaluation of battery usage. Under the terms of the procurement documents, any data from the
buses will belong to King County and will be provided to the County in an unencrypted “raw” format. Per
normal Metro processes, this data will be used to support vehicle maintenance. In the future, the
vehicle data should be incorporated into the broader IT platform described below.

Scheduling and Dispatch of Electric Fleet
Metro’s Scheduling “HASTUS” software is being upgraded to adopt software features that support the
requirements of a fully electric fleet. The scheduling process must take into account the charge capacity
of the fleet and on‐route charging needed to complete assigned work. The scheduling software creates
vehicle schedules by chaining together service trips and minimizing deadhead and layover time and
distance. With a fully electric fleet, the scheduling system must accommodate on‐route charging, and
determine how to chain together service trips into vehicle schedules based on requirements for and
availability of on‐route charging stations.
Dispatch of Metro’s current diesel hybrid fleet assumes that each bus is fully fueled at the base before
assignment. The main considerations for dispatching buses are the type of vehicle required, and the
mileage required to perform the assignment relative to the vehicle’s required maintenance. With an
electrified fleet, the addition of the electric charge capacity must be considered when assigning a bus,
coupled with the accessibility and proximity of layover charging available on route. These criteria must
be matched against the charge required to perform the assignment, as well as additional influencing
factors such as topography and temperature.
In addition to matching appropriate coach options with assigned work, the base yard management
system must plan for the circulation of coaches through charging stations, and position coaches so that
adequately‐charged buses are accessible to be dispatched as they are needed. The system must track
circulation and dispatching to support the frequency of dispatch required to support peak service
demands.
The current Vehicle Dispatch system needs to be replaced to accommodate the dispatch requirements
of an electrified fleet. A technology Dispatch system replacement project is planned for the 2023‐2024
biennium.

6. Operations
Metro is planning to first deploy the battery electric buses on routes in South King County. The first 40
buses will be operating from South Campus, using the new South Base Test Facility to charge. The
service profile design began by analyzing all routes from South Base. From these routes, Metro’s
scheduling group identified vehicle assignments of less than 140 miles, a range current testing supports,
and the range required in the procurement documents to determine which routes would be supported
from the initial deployment.

The next large orders of battery buses will also operate from Metro’s South Campus as Interim Base
opens in 2025 and South Annex Base in 2028. For these next deployments, Metro is planning to develop
several layover chargers. With layover charging in place, battery‐electric buses can be assigned to
vehicle assignments that are longer than 140 miles. To help identify optimal locations for on‐route

7. Workforce
Metro has developed and is expanding upon training and educational programs for vehicle
maintenance, operators and other employees working with battery‐electric buses. Metro has a strong
foundation in electrified transportation. Metro operates and maintains the electric trolley system which
has been in operation since 1939 and Metro’s hybrid diesel‐electric buses include batteries.
Training is required for battery maintenance, electrical infrastructure maintenance, bus cleaning and
maintenance, safety and dispatching, operator training, transit control center and service quality. The
development of these training programs spans groups from across the organization including Safety and
Security, Vehicle Maintenance, Fleet Engineering, Capital Planning and Power and Facilities.
Metro is working both to support existing employees through training and to recruit new employees
with appropriate skills. Metro’s Vehicle Maintenance group works with local Community Colleges to hire
graduates for the mechanic rank. Our in‐house educational programs support workers to stay current
on technology and high voltage safety. Our work force is equitable and our union very supportive to
employees. We work to recruit and retain employees with a competitive pay scale and create a
respectful and diverse work environment. Furthermore, we ensure employees have the training
necessary to safely perform their jobs.
Additionally, fleet procurement includes training for vehicle maintenance for our fleet needs with each
contract.

Collaborating with Labor Management
King County Metro Vehicle Maintenance has a long history collaborating with our Local 587 partners. In
the case of the Battery Electric Training our Labor Management were very supportive and pleased that
we are taking a proactive approach to educate their members on the emerging technology that will be
our future.

Apprenticeships
King County Metro Vehicle Maintenance has an established State Registered Apprenticeship
program. The program will be expanding to support the Battery Electric bus efforts and education. As
King County Metro Transit is a leader in Equity and Social Justice, we will be drawing from our current
diverse workforce to fill the new apprenticeship positions. We are always searching and reaching out to
our local school and colleges for new talent and individuals who are interested in joining the transit
world.

chargers, Metro is conducting a Transit System Electrification Study that will include an analysis of
energy needs of service routes, factoring in topography, varying weather, and passenger loading. This
will help inform service planning as well as suggest locations such as park‐and‐rides, mobility hubs and
transit‐oriented development sites that could offer potential charging locations.

To develop a workforce with the skills required to maintain a zero‐emission bus fleet, Metro has
developed the BEB Training Academy. This involves training current Vehicle Maintenance Employees
and expanding the Vehicle Maintenance staff. Since procuring diesel‐hybrids in 2004, electric trolleys in
2014 and Proterra’s in 2015, Fleet Engineering has developed curriculum for training Vehicle
Maintenance employees providing them with the skills needed to repair and maintain electric and

Curriculums are divided is three categories: Primarily Curriculums, Secondary Curriculums and Classes
for First Responder, TCC, and District Supervisors



Primarily Curriculums
These classes are developed to train Vehicle Maintenance personal on how to maintain, trouble
shoot and repair the BEB coaches. The Primary classes will be held before the opening of the
South Interim Base.



Secondary Curriculums
The Secondary classes are classes that are developed to train Lead Mechanics and Mechanics on
how to maintain, trouble shoot and repair the BEB coaches. These classes will be held after the
South Interim Base is opened. Some systems are utilized current KCM coaches and are deemed
Secondary classes.



Classes for First Responder, TCC, and District Supervisors
Class designed to aid First Responders when responding to accidents involving all electric
coaches. The class is familiarization with the coach. Each agency will be giving the Emergency
Response Guides. The class is also designed to train District Supervisors and TCC.

Charger Maintenance
Metro’s Transit Facilities Division has been successfully maintaining bus chargers for over five years. As
projects are constructed, charger maintenance training is included in project contracts ‐ charger
maintenance training was included as part of the contracts for both South Base Test Facility (SBTF) and
Interim Base, for example. These training packages include a combination of classroom training and on‐
the‐job training.

Operator Training
Metro has developed training to prepare operators to drive BEBs. The training takes approximately 30
minutes, added on to the traditional training. The focus of the BEB training is to familiarize the operator
with the power gages and controls and provide an opportunity to go on a drive so drivers can get a feel
of the extra torque and acceleration on turns and inclines. The main considerations in driving a BEB
instead of a hybrid coach are:
1. Monitoring the charge level in the BEB
2. The difference in the operating noise level of the buses – for example, since BEBs are quieter, its
especially important to notice for pedestrians in the area.
3. Differences in the drivers compartment of gages and knobs
4. The extra power and acceleration of the BEBs
5. Docking into the charging stations

battery‐electric technology. While some training classes for all‐electric buses will need to be developed,
many of the curriculum used for the diesel‐hybrid and electric trolleys can be applied for all‐electric
buses. This section outlines the curriculum developed to ensure a successful transition toward all zero‐
emission, all‐electric bus fleet and to prepare a well‐trained Vehicle Maintenance department.

King County Metro Transit’s commitment to transition to an all zero‐emission fleet by 2035 is codified in
agency policies adopted by the King County Council and King County Regional Transit Authority. These
policies formalize the strategic direction for reducing emissions from our fleet and are an extension of a
legacy of sustainability commitments. In 2013, King County Metro Transit was a founding signatory to
the APTA Sustainability Commitment. Metro Transit’s commitment in the 2015 King County Strategic
Climate Action Plan was furthered by the 2017 commitment to transition to a zero‐emission fleet
powered by renewable energy. In 2021, the 2020 King County Strategic Climate Action Plan11, Metro
Transit Strategic Plan for Public Transportation 2021 – 203112, and Metro Connects long‐range plan
were adopted. These policies established targets to reduce Metro Transit fleet GHG emissions by 45
percent by 2025 and 70 percent by 2030, compared to a 2017 baseline. These policies adopted an
accelerated target for Metro’s bus fleet zero‐emission transition goal to 2035.
Metro Transit submitted these adopted climate action plans to FTA, as part of the FTA’s Climate
Challenge initiative. On Earth Day, April 22, the Federal Transit Administration recognized Metro and
nine other transit agencies for exemplary efforts to combat climate change as part of the FTA’s Climate
Challenge initiative. The FTA’s Climate Challenge was created in 2021 to help advance President Biden’s
greenhouse gas reduction goals. A total of 171 transit agencies have signed on to participate. Awardees
were honored across eight different categories. Metro was named the “Most Equitable” in recognition
the ways that the SCAP and Metro’s Strategic Plan to address climate change impacts and transportation
access in underserved communities.
Climate policies adopted by Washington State in 2021, including the Climate Commitment Act and the
Clean Fuels Standard. Both policies are expected to help support Metro Transit and statewide efforts to
electrify transit vehicles. The Climate Commitment Act (SB 5126) will establish a statewide cap and
invest program that will for the first time put a price on GHG pollution (implementation date of 1/1/23),
with the overall target to reduce statewide GHG emissions 95 percent by 2050 while providing billions of
dollars of new investments in Washington climate action. The Climate Commitment Act is projected to
generate several new revenue sources earmarked for reducing transportation emissions. Most of the
transportation funding will go to transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and electrification projects.
The Clean Fuels Standard (HB 1091) establishes regulation (implementation date of 1/1/23) for reducing
GHGs of transportation fuels (i.e. gasoline and diesel) by 10 percent by 2028 and 20 percent by 2035, as
compared to 2017 levels. Under the Clean Fuels Standard, Metro Transit can generate credits for
electrification of public transit vehicles. Utilities in Washington state will generate revenues from
residential EV charging and be required to re‐invest a portion of revenues to support electrification
efforts in communities overburdened by air pollution. This state policy will provide a revenue source for
Metro Transit and facilitate electrification efforts by increasing utility partnership capacity and create a
more favorable market for electrification in the region.

8. Financial Resources
Metro’s current budget includes funding to build and electrify Metro’s Interim Base at South Campus
and the new South Annex Base – Interim Base will support 120 BEBs and South Annex Base will support
250 BEBs. Funding is also included for additional battery electric buses. The 2023‐2024 Biennial budget
that will include the planned expenditures for the period 2023 to 2032 is currently under development.
The intent is to develop a Capital Budget that will fully fund the necessary vehicle and infrastructure
investments to achieve a zero‐emission fleet by 2035. The requested budget becomes public record at
the end of September 2022 as it is transmitted to our elected county council for consideration, with
adoption at the end of November. As part of our funding approach, Metro seeks state and federal grant
funding wherever possible for our BEB fleet. Financing models are further described below.

Financing Models
There are four general financing models that public agencies can use to fund capital infrastructure like
electrification. These are cash financing, which is Metro’s current model; debt financing where Metro
sells bonds to fund electrification; leasing buses and charging infrastructure from bus manufacturers; or
grant funding, which Metro uses for bus procurement. There are also private partnerships which are not
included in these models. Generally Metro uses cash financing and some grant funding for bus
procurement and capital projects. Per current practice, Metro utilizes the revenue fleet replacement
reserve for years where large fleet expenditures are incurred. The revenue fleet replacement reserve
was developed to help mitigate the impact of variability in the replacement costs from year to year. The
exact mix of cash funding, reserve use and debt financing will be developed based on Metro’s financial
condition and other economic considerations.

Funding Opportunities
A combination of cash, grants and debt financing would be used to fund electrification.



Cash/Fund Balance
o Metro will prioritize existing fund balance and projected revenues from sales tax, fares and
other sources to support spending on electrification infrastructure and fleet.
Competitive Grants
o Metro will seek grants through established and new sources of funding that electrification
projects and fleet replacement would be competitive for.
Debt Funding
o Despite the recent increase in projections for financing rates, it will still be beneficial for Metro
to use debt to finance some of the cost of electrification.
o Electrification and South Annex Base projects could be good options for the FTA Transportation
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Credit Program
Additional future revenue sources
o Legislated increases of sales tax, property tax or other sources, including revenues from credit
generation via the Washington State Clean Fuels Standard, could help to fund the cost of
electrification infrastructure.

1.E.1.a

Long range battery‐electric bus service will be launched in South King County where historically
underserved communities live. Battery‐electric buses benefit communities living in the areas of the
bases by reducing ambient noise and eliminating local pollution. Metro may also choose to sponsor
educational events/outreach to the community about the new technology and its role in reducing
carbon emissions and improving air quality.
In addition, the location of the bases in proximity to areas with a high
percentage of priority populations (people of color, low‐income
individuals, and people with limited English proficiency) will make it
easier for Metro partnerships for recruiting and job skills development
with local community colleges to reach priority populations. Many of the
projects that will be undertaken to implement battery‐electric buses will
be subject to King County “priority hire” requirements, mandating that
contractors advertise and prioritize hiring within zip codes that have
lower income and employment levels than the King County Average. In
addition, in procurement for projects associated with the battery‐
electric bus program, Metro will use the “Equity and Social Justice
innovation plan,” criteria, offering consultants the opportunity to
propose equitable innovations aligned with the county’s Equity and
Social Justice Strategic Plan as part of their delivery of projects.
There will be benefits to the operator and maintenance workforce,
beyond the potential for advancement opportunities through job skills training. Compared to existing
technology, driving a battery‐electric bus reduces fatigue because of reduced noise, vibration and there
is less exposure to the operator and maintenance staff to criteria air pollutants and toxins.

In 2016, Metro purchased three short‐range BEBs currently running in Bellevue. Metro‐operated BEBs
increased to 11 in the ensuing years. A short‐range BEB generally has a smaller fast‐charging battery
pack, which lowers bus cost as batteries are the most expensive component of a BEB; a smaller battery
pack also reduces the bus range. These BEBs have a range of approximately 25 miles and a charge time
of 10 minutes.
In 2017, Metro released a report on the “Feasibility of Achieving a Carbon‐Neutral or Zero‐Emission
Fleet” (2017 Study) in response to Council Motion 14633, requesting an assessment of the feasibility of
achieving either a carbon‐neutral or zero‐emission Metro vehicle fleet. The 2017 Study found a zero‐
emission fleet was attainable by 2040, and BEBs with a range of 140 miles satisfied 70 percent of service
needs without changing service profiles. The 2017 Study also acknowledged that BEB technology was
rapidly changing, and Metro’s zero‐emission strategy could change based on technology shifts. Based on
this information, Metro developed an internal strategy to electrify its bus fleet. The internal strategy had
electrification beginning in South King County and expanding throughout the County over time. Each
base was to be electrified one‐half at a time, and all bases would be converted by 2040. In concert with
base electrification, the bus fleet would transition to BEBs.
As part of the 2017 Study, Metro conducted an equity impact review, which included assessment of
Metro bus routes and the vulnerability to air pollution of communities along routes. The analysis found
that local communities located along corridors of routes served from Metro’s South Base have
historically been disproportionately affected by air pollution. Metro conducted a public stakeholder
process, and a primary recommendation of this group was to focus service out of South Campus to
prioritize the benefit of improved air pollution in communities disproportionately burdened.13
In Error! Reference source not found. below from the 2017 study, darker shaded areas are more
vulnerable to air pollution than lighter shaded areas. Red bus routes are the highest priority quintile to
be served by zero‐emission buses, green routes are the lowest.14 In the 2017 Study, the Executive and
Metro recommended – and the Council approved – the goal of transitioning to an all zero‐emission bus
fleet powered by renewable energy by 2040, to order 120 BEBs by 2020, and to scale up electrification
first in South King County.
The 2017 Study emphasized that several requirements must continue to be met by Metro and the bus
industry for this target to be achievable, including: vehicle and charging technology meeting operational
needs especially for 60‐foot vehicles, standardization of charging infrastructure, and availability of
renewable energy supplies. The 2017 Study also highlighted that Metro and partners would need to
continue to assess: safety for customers and employees, staff training, equity impacts, emergency
preparedness planning, and total costs of transitioning to a zero‐emission fleet to ensure that
incremental costs do not limit Metro’s ability to deliver and expand service.

This section was prepared by the Center for Transportation and the Environment1 and reflects industry‐
wide concepts that are applicable to other transit agencies as well as King County Metro. Battery‐
electric buses use energy stored in an on‐board battery
pack to drive an electric motor (or motors) which turns
the drivetrain and propels the bus. In addition to the
energy provided for propulsion, the battery system
provides energy to drive electric accessories, such as the
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system,
air compressor, and power steering pump. Inverters are
used to convert current from the battery (direct current,
or DC) to a form that is useable by the motor and
accessories (alternating current, or AC). A down
converter is used to reduce the DC voltage for delivery to
the low voltage batteries, which are used to provide small
amounts of electricity required while the bus is not
operating or in motion. Components such as the
multiplex I/O system, cameras, Wi‐Fi and farebox can
draw a load even while the vehicle itself is not being
powered. Furthermore, a low voltage current is also
required to close the contactors to start the bus. This
type of current is provided by the low‐voltage batteries. A
high‐level schematic of the vehicle systems is provided in

1.E.1.a

Unlike a conventional diesel engine or a diesel‐electric hybrid where the fuel is pumped from an external
source into an onboard tank, the “fuel” for a battery‐ electric bus is provided by the electrical grid and
applied to the vehicle by a charging system. Please refer to Table 1 for a summary of the primary
concepts relative to battery‐electric buses.

In a conventional diesel bus the amount of energy available on the bus is represented by the number of
gallons of fuel in the tank. In an electric bus the amount of energy stored in the battery is represented in
terms of kilowatt‐hours (kWh).
One limitation of today’s battery‐electric buses is that they cannot store as much energy as a diesel bus.
Using the example in Table 1, the equivalent of 450kWh of energy is approximately 12 gallons of diesel
fuel in a conventional bus. At four miles per gallon, a diesel bus that holds 12 gallons of fuel would only
be able to travel 48 miles before needing to refuel. However, battery‐electric buses are much more
efficient than diesel buses. Therefore, using that same amount of energy capacity, an electric bus may
be able to travel 140 miles or more on average (depending on conditions) before needing to recharge.
However, a typical diesel bus may have a 100‐gallon tank, giving it a 400‐mile range using the same
assumptions. Using today’s technology, the only way to match that range (on one charge) in a battery‐
electric bus is to add heavier and/or more batteries. Due to weight and space considerations, adding
more batteries to compensate for the difference is not a viable option. As a result, a battery‐electric bus
currently has a shorter operating range than its diesel counterpart. Industry research efforts continue to
focus on battery density and new chemistries to address the amount of energy batteries can store.
Battery density has been improving year‐to‐year. It is not unreasonable to expect that battery‐electric
buses will be able to carry more stored energy without increasing weight or limiting passenger loads in
the future, further reducing the energy deficit relative to diesel buses.
“Refueling” battery‐electric buses takes longer than filling a diesel tank. The time required to charge a
battery‐electric bus (and provide the energy to operate) will vary based on the charging technology
used. Typical base charging (using pedestal mounted chargers, for example) requires the bus to be
plugged in for several hours to be fully charged. On‐route charging, also called layover charging, takes
advantage of scheduled stops or layovers to restore the state of charge of the battery and therefore
extending the operational range. Using layover charging, range would be governed by the number of
layovers and the amount of time available to charge at each opportunity.
It is critical for transit agencies to assess how battery‐electric buses will perform in service prior to
deployment. Developing a deployment strategy prior to purchasing and placing buses in service allows a
transit agency to make decisions about energy storage and charging options, which are two of the
distinct operating characteristics of battery‐electric buses. It is also important to coordinate with the
utility while developing a deployment strategy. Decisions about charging strategies will affect the time
of day and amount of electricity consumed which in turn affects costs. It is important that a transit
agency understand all these factors related to providing energy to the buses prior to deployment.

Energy

Power
Power describes the rate of applying or using energy over time. In a conventional diesel vehicle, a
common way this is used is to express the output or “performance” of an engine in terms of
horsepower. The equivalent unit of measure in electric vehicles is kilowatts (kW). Power is what the
battery pack can provide as an output to the vehicle for performance, such as speed and acceleration.

1.E.1.a

Power as an input is an important consideration during battery‐electric bus operational planning
because it determines the amount of time it will take to charge the battery. As discussed in relation to
Energy, it is important to engage with the utility during planning. Depending on the power being applied
by each charger and the number and type of chargers operating at the same time, it can also
significantly impact the electricity bill (load or demand charges, see Section “Utility Rates”, page 19 for
additional discussion).
What About Amps and Volts
Because power is an important concept, it is useful to understand what controls the amount of power
that can be applied to a battery to charge it. In electrical terms, the basic equation is:
Power = Voltage × Current
or, equivalently, in electrical units:
Watts = Volts × Amps
Amperes, commonly Amps, is a measure of electrical current, and voltage is essentially the amount of
electrical “pressure” available to move that current. Using the analogy of a water hose with an
adjustable nozzle, one can think of current as the water flow through the hose, and voltage is like the
amount of pressure available to spray the water when the nozzle lever is squeezed.
In the context of vehicle charging, the amount of power (rate of energy) applied is determined by both
the power rating of the charger as well as the battery system that it is charging. The charger must match
the battery pack’s voltage, and the current is set according to the battery’s ability to accept power. The
battery pack and charger are in constant communication during charging and the battery pack will limit
the current from the charger based on the battery’s capability. For this reason, simply dividing the
battery capacity by the charger’s power rating will not correctly predict charging times.

Appendix B

Attachment: 2023-03-21 ZEV Meeting Packet (4768 : Zero Emission Policy - Draft Proposed Amendment)

However, power can also be used to describe the rate of energy being applied by the charger as an input
into the battery to replenish it. When power is used to describe the input, the conventional equivalent is
how fast a diesel pump can fill a tank (e.g. gallons/minute).

Pace’s Transition to
Zero Emissions

1.E.1

Fact Sheet
In 2021, Pace’s Board of Directors
adopted Driving Innovation, an
ambitious strategic vision plan that
commits the agency to operating a zero
emission fleet by 2040.

Why electric?

This transition begins in 2022 with an order of
20 battery-electric buses and their charging
equipment. The first six of these buses will be
placed at Pace’s North Division Garage in
Waukegan.

Long-term savings. While implementing new
technology and installing charging infrastructure is
costly up front, in the long-run, zero emission vehicles
will save Pace money as equipment prices decrease
and the energy market changes.

Concurrently, Pace is preparing a zero emission
transition plan and facility plan, which include:

Pace will continue to study emerging alternative fuels,
such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas, to
maintain our goal of zero emissions, and to study how
CNG buses can be converted to run on hydrogen.

● A detailed route analysis to assess

charging requirements.

● An assessment of current and proposed

bus maintenance and storage facilities for
electrification.

● An evaluation of current fleet capacity,

proposed growth over time, and plans for
fleet replacement.

● A review of costs associated with the

conversion.

This initial order will help Pace determine how
to move forward at scale, building hundreds of
new vehicles, converting more than a dozen
facilities, redesigning routes when necessary
and working with vendors and partners across
our large region to upgrade equipment and
install community- based charging
infrastructure to recharge buses that are on
the road all day.

Pace has been a leader in new
technology, deploying hybrid and CNG
buses years ago. We are excited to take
this next step towards zero emissions.

Climate change. It will take all hands on deck to avoid
catastrophic effects from climate change.
Clean air. Pollution from gas-powered vehicles causes
health and environmental problems.

Why 2040?

This aligns with goals set by the state and U.S. as well
as scientific projections. While 2040 might seem like a
long way off, 18 years is just enough time to:
Secure hundreds of millions in funding
Replace over 700 buses
Finalize vehicle plan & facilities plan (by July)
Ensure electric grid will accommodate vehicles
Convert Pace garages
Build charging infrastructure
Work through implementation issues.

Current Status | March 2022
●

Just placed first order of 20 electric buses.

●

Now preparing fleet transition and
facilities plans due out July.

Prioritizing Equity, First Electric Buses to be Deployed to Historically Underserved Communities

New Zero-Emission Bus Fleet Will Deepen the MTA's Commitment to Sustainability and Environmental Justice
Traducción al español
Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will deploy 60 zero-emission electric buses at six bus depots serving all five
boroughs. This deployment deepens the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's commitment to equity and environmental justice by prioritizing communities
with high asthma and air pollution rates. In New York City, approximately 75 percent of Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus depots are located in
low/moderate-income communities, and transit bus routes run disproportionately through these neighborhoods.
"My administration is laser focused on speeding up our transition to clean energy," Governor Hochul said. "Public transportation has always been critical to
reducing emissions and this deployment is a major step toward the MTA's commitment to a zero-emission bus fleet by 2040. New York's progress in modernizing
our transportation infrastructure has far-reaching impacts that help address social equity and continue to cement our status as a national leader in the fight
against climate change."

The announcement represents a major step towards the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) 2018 commitment of deploying a zero-emission bus fleet
by 2040, which will avoid 520,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually. The first of these new electric buses will begin arriving at depots in the second half of
2022 and will be at all six locations in 2023. The Authority currently operates 15 zero-emission electric buses, and the historic $51.5 Billion MTA 2020-2024
Capital Program includes $1.1 billion in funding to buy another 500.
These buses will provide service among numerous routes at the following depots:
Grand Ave, Queens: servicing the B24, B32, B39, B47, B48, B57, B60, B62, Q59
Charleston, Staten Island: servicing the S55, S56, S74, S78, S84
East New York, Brooklyn: servicing the B12, B14, B15, B17, B25, B42, B45, B65, B82, B83, B84, Q24, Q56
Kingsbridge, Manhattan: servicing the Bx3, Bx7, Bx10, Bx13, Bx18, Bx20, M100
Michael J. Quill, Manhattan: servicing the M8, M9, M12, M20, M21, M22, M42, M50, M55, M57, M66, M72
Jamaica, Queens: servicing the Q3, Q4, Q5, Q17, Q30, Q42, Q77, Q84, Q85
In addition, five of these bus depots will be equipped with new state-of-the-art charging infrastructure to support the MTA's growing electric bus fleet starting in
the second half of 2022: Grand Ave, Charleston, East New York, Jamaica, and Kingsbridge. The on-route charger at Williamsburg Bridge Plaza will also receive
updates. All infrastructure upgrades will be completed in advance of bus arrivals at each depot.
Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said, "I can think of no better way to celebrate Earth Day than to announce this
significant deployment of electric buses. We know that buses are engines of equity, and it is an MTA priority to bring electric buses to environmental justice
communities most impacted by climate change and pollution. Any New Yorker can join the fight against climate change by riding with the MTA, and these electric
buses will only further reduce carbon emissions in our region."
New York City Transit Interim President Craig Cipriano said, "The MTA is committed to a zero-emissions bus fleet to protect our city from the harmful
effects of fossil fuels, and this deployment is a big step towards making environmentally friendly mass transit even greener. This deployment will greatly expand
the presence of zero-emissions electric buses on New York City's streets in all five boroughs and represents significant progress towards a fully zero-emissions bus
fleet."
New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, "On this Earth Day, it's a pleasure to
join MTA in this celebration of their significant step forward in electrifying their fleet as we continue to work together to combat climate change and pivot towards
our clean energy future. Zero-emission buses play a key role in reducing air pollution in our communities while providing essential transportation services in
connecting New Yorkers to jobs, activities and amenities across the New York City area."
Public transportation has always been critical to reducing emissions and this deployment is a major step toward the MTA's commitment to a zero-emission bus
fleet by 2040.
Governor Kathy Hochul
New York Power Authority Interim President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, "The MTA is setting a high bar when it comes to leading a full-scale
transition to clean public transit and the New York Power Authority is proud of its role in making this all-electric bus fleet a reality. We are finalizing design for
the modern overhead charging infrastructure in four depots and will move into construction in the coming months. This partnership is bringing us closer to a city
transportation system that will help protect the communities' health and promise a more sustainable future for all of New York City."
This deployment contains several major milestones for the MTA's bus fleet, including the first agency-owned standard 40-foot electric buses, the first in-depot
overhead pantograph chargers, the first partnership with the New York Power Authority to manage charger installation, and the first partnership with a power
company to install high-tension service and construction of a sub-station to supply electric buses. The initiative prioritizes environmental justice communities,
putting green buses on the roads of neighborhoods that will most benefit from them, and will accelerate the Authority's progress in further cutting carbon
emissions in its bus fleet. The MTA presently has over 1,300 low-emissions hybrid buses in its fleet, including 399 2nd generation hybrid buses which run on
battery-only EV mode a portion of the time, greatly reducing fossil fuel usage.

With the New Depots, MTA Will Have Electric Bus Depots Serving all Five Boroughs

The MTA is also commemorating Earth Day this year by reminding New Yorkers that the best way to fight climate change is to take public transit. Every year, the
MTA's environmentally sustainable transit system allows the New York metropolitan region to avoid more than 17 million metric tons of greenhouse gas
emissions annually — or more than three times the annual greenhouse gas emissions of San Francisco. It also means New York State has the lowest per capita
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The commitment to an all zero-emission bus fleet by 2040 will make what is already the
most sustainable way to get around the New York region even greener.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams said, "We know that environmental justice begins on the ground, starting with the communities most impacted by climate

1.E.1.a
change. Public transit is a critical piece of this work to build a greener city and more zero-emission buses will supercharge that effort, getting New Yorkers where
they need to go while reducing harmful air pollution. I thank Governor Hochul for prioritizing environmental justice, centering the communities hit hardest by
climate change, and helping move our city forward."
Representative Jamaal Bowman said, "Addressing climate change is critical for all of our communities. Electrifying our transportation system is an essential
part of that fight to protect people and our planet, and I believe that public transit should lead the way. I am happy to see the MTA taking concrete steps towards
reducing greenhouse gasses while providing reliable transportation for neighbors here in New York's 16th Congressional District. I look forward to supporting the
agency in accelerating its transition to clean energy, and bringing not only our district but the nation into a more sustainable future."

Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, "It is exciting to see the MTA move more expeditiously in its transition to a fully-electric bus fleet. Our
fight against climate change can be led not only by offering people fast, reliable, and efficient transit service but also by ensuring the vehicles moving people are
fully electric. I look forward to riding these electric buses as they hit Manhattan's streets."
Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr said, "For generations, unchecked fossil fuel consumption and emission production has had dangerous
and disparate consequences for many of our historically underserved communities across Queens, from Astoria's "Asthma Alley" to Jamaica and beyond. With
today's announcement, that tide begins to turn. Fully electrifying our bus fleet is a critical step forward to preserving our environment and protecting our families,
and I am grateful to the MTA for its commitment to rolling out more electric buses in Queensthis fall. I look forward to working with the MTA to further expedite
this process as climate change continues to bear down on our borough."
New York City Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers said, "New York City has been plagued by disinvestment for years, causing black and brown
communities to lack reliable access to transportation. I applaud Governor Kathy Hochul and MTA Chairman Janno Lieber for prioritizing equitable access to
green transportation to ensure under-resourced communities have access to reliable, safe, affordable and accessible transportation. Deployment of 60 zeroemission electric buses - like the Q5, that services Laurelton and Rosedale - will ensure New Yorkers have access to transportation, while not contributing to
increases in asthma rates and air pollution."
New York City Council Member Eric Dinowitz said, "With what we know now about the unnerving acceleration of climate change, it is welcomed news
that the MTA is looking to do their part with the deployment of 60 new electric buses. This is just a first step towards an 100% zero emissions fleet by 2040, but a
critical one. We are at a time where rates of asthma are soaring in The Bronx, and scientists across the globe are pleading with governments and private industry
to take these steps to protect the livability of our earth. I am appreciative that our agencies here in New York are listening and taking action."
New York City Council Member Sandy Nurse said, "Today's announcement by the MTA of the rollout of a number of all-electric buses is a necessary step
toward reducing our transit system's emissions and their negative health impacts on our communities. As the MTA continues to make progress toward a 100%
zero-emissions fleet, we must continue to ensure we prioritize environmental justice communities like East New York, which have too often been made to bear the
burden of polluting infrastructure."
New York City Council Member Robert Holden said, "Our environment is precious, and we should leave this world better than we found it. On this Earth
Day, and every day, we should make every effort to reduce our emissions and improve our climate."
President of the New York League of Conservation Voters Julie Tighe said, "We can't tackle the climate crisis without tackling transportation pollution
and investing in mass transit. There's no better progress for the environment and public health in New York to celebrate on Earth Day than the MTA following
through on its commitment to deploy 60 zero-emissions electric buses on its way to a fully electric fleet. With asthma the leading cause of school absences,
reducing air pollution in communities that house bus depots is critical to improve the public health of our neighbors, and keep kids in class. The New York League
of Conservation Voters thanks the Governor, the MTA, and the collaboration among our leaders to make this possible."

State Senator Leroy Comrie said, "I welcome this announcement of additional green buses and their presence in all five boroughs. Zero-emission buses are a
step forward for our transit system, for our neighborhoods, and for our environment. As we transition toward an all zero-emission bus fleet, it is important to keep
environmental justice in mind and ensure that we continue to prioritize inclusion alongside sustainability."State Senator Roxanne J. Persaud said, "As we
celebrate Earth Day 2022, it is fitting that this announcement is being made. The sixty new all-electric buses will help reduce emissions across MTA's bus fleet,
particularly along some routes serving Senate District 19. I applaud the MTA's commitment to moving toward a 100% zero-emissions fleet by 2040."

Customer Energy Solutions Senior Vice President Lenny Singh said, "Con Edison is proud to be a partner with the MTA in its significant shift to
electric buses. As more electric vehicles hit the streets, it's critical there's a robust charging network in place. That's where we come in: by investing to ensure the
reliability of the electric grid, and by committing to New York State's goals for a clean energy future."
