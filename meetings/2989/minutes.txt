B. Recommended Actions

• Addition of Information Section to Committee Agendas
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board adopt a
ministerial change to the format of committee meeting agendas to include a
section for informational items not intended for discussion during meetings
unless expressly requested by one or more Directors.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 – Strong and Ethical Leadership
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
Motion:

Director Catlin made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 21, 2020
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.
In an effort to save time, Committee Chair Cook
asked if there was any discussion or opposition
to the recommended action.

Hearing no comments, Committee Chair Cook declared the motion PASSED
Unanimously.
