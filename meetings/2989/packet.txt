BOARD INITIATED ACTION ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Date: April 9, 2020

From:

Barbara G McManus,
Board Office

Date:

April 9, 2020

Subject:

Addition of Information Section to Committee
Agendas

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 14, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board adopt a ministerial change to the format
of committee meeting agendas to include a section for informational items not intended for discussion
during meetings unless expressly requested by one or more Directors.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 – Strong and Ethical Leadership
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
Meeting agendas reflect the established order of business. For Board and Committee Meetings, the order
of business is described in the Board Bylaws, specifically Art. V, §4 and Art. VI, §1(f), respectively.
For a typical committee meeting, the agenda includes the following standard items: A) Call to Order; B)
Recommended Actions; C) Updates; D) Other Matters; E) Next Meeting Date; F) Adjourn.
Directors have expressed on several occasions an interest in truncating the duration of committee
meetings. At the same time, the Board has indicated its desire to continue to receive ample information
to inform the decision-making process.
DISCUSSION
For a given agenda, this ministerial change would allow staff to include a section, between Updates and
Other Matters, specifically intended for items of recurring, non-actionable, and informational nature.
These items are not intended to be presented or discussed by staff; should questions arise or
clarification be needed for any Director while reviewing the agenda, the Director would contact staff in
advance of the meeting as needed. Should the Director feel further discussion is warranted during the
meeting, the Director would then submit a request, both to the chair of the appropriate committee and
to the Executive Manager of the Board Office, as far in advance as practicable, asking that the item be
opened for questions or discussion as necessary. Advance notice of such request ensures that the
appropriate staff resources can be available during the meeting to present information and respond to
questions and comments as necessary.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

This action is an attempt to strike a balance between the timely and transparent dissemination of
information to the Board and the desire to employ additional time management practices during
committee meetings. Should this action be adopted by the Board, Directors are encouraged to continue
to make inquiries of appropriate staff prior to meetings to the greatest extent possible, as contemplated
in the Board Operating Guidelines, adopted February 2019
Following this change, the typical order of business for committee agendas would be as follows: A) Call
to Order; B) Recommended Actions; C) Updates; D) Information; E) Other Matters; F) Next Meeting
Date; G) Adjourn.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No additional expenditure is necessary as a result of the adoption of this item. Rather, increased meeting
efficiency would result in moderate cost savings as a result of reduced need for support staff and facility
resources.

The thought would be that after review if there were any questions on the
information items that they would be sent to the Board office to have staff address
them. We could either send the questions and responses directly to the full Board for
review or address only those question and answers briefly in committee.

Promotional Fare Pilot Program
(PFPP) for the N-Line
Update to RTD Board
April 14, 2020
1

Packet Pg. 33

Attachment: PFPP N-Line Board Update 4-14-20v2 legal (4166 : Promotional Fares Pilot Program Update)

1.C.3.a

Parameters of PFPP from November 2019 Board Action
• Goal is to test relationship between fares and ridership
• All fares for the N-line from Union Station to 124th will be the local fare
for the opening 6 months of revenue operation
• Fares for 112th Station and 124th Station will revert back to regional fare
after 6 months
• At the end of 12 months, RTD staff will conduct an analysis of ridership
and revenue impacts to present to the Board
• Based on the documented results of the PPFP the Board may choose to
apply this same 6-month pilot approach to other corridors

1.C.3.a

Recap of February Board Update.
• Staff relayed to the Board FTA's feedback on
Program:
• There is flexibility to include more than one corridor in the
initial 6-month promotional fare pilot
• Rolling 6-month pilot programs could also be allowed, but
that approach may necessitate fare equity analyses prior to
initiating each subsequent pilot

2. 6-month promotional fare multiple corridors at the same time
3. Rolling promotions on corridors in 6-month increments if equity
analysis allows
Based on this information, some Board members expressed an
interest in Option 2 and requested staff develop alternatives for
Board consideration

Attachment: PFPP N-Line Board Update 4-14-20v2 legal (4166 : Promotional Fares Pilot Program Update)

1.C.3.a

Equity Considerations for Promotions
• Title VI requires a fare equity analysis for all fare changes regardless
of the amount of increase or decrease to determine if the change has
a discriminatory impact based on race, color or national origin.
• Exceptions for mitigating measures and promotions up to 6 months.
• To make a fare reduction permanent, an equity analysis must
establish the change has no discriminatory impact.
• Expanding the Local Zone means that riders from areas already
within the Local Zone along the N Line do not receive the benefit of
the promotion.
• Always a potential that individuals file a Title VI complaint with FTA.

1.C.3.a

Staff Recommendation
• Recommend continuing forward with Option 1: N-Line Only
(as approved by the Board in November 2019)
• Reasons:

• COVID 19 situation provides uncertainty for RTD financially, so focusing on the
least costly option is important
• Least complicated to implement and communicate and work to implement is
already underway
• Larger fare changes (such as Option 2A and 2B) should be implemented with a
public process and more detailed analysis on impacts
• Option 1 will provide RTD with valuable insights to inform future fare
considerations

Next Steps
• April 2020 FA&A Committee - Board to provide staff feedback
• May 2020 FA&A Committee (if necessary)
• if Board desires to modify current PFPP, staff brings back as
an Action Item a new preferred option to ensure
implementation by planned N-Line opening date
• if Board desires to retain current structure and direction
for PFPP along the N-Line, no further action necessary

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

April 8, 2020

Subject:

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 8, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 14, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 56

1.C.5

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of April 5, 2020, 8,404 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 5,262 have been approved,
2,067 have been denied and the remaining 1,075 are pending. Of the 2,067 denied, 1,403 were denied
because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better discount.
449 were denied because their address was out of District, 44 were denied because it was a duplicate
application, 30 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 7 were denied because they
did not respond to requests for additional information, and 134 were denied because they did not meet
the income threshold. Of the 1,075 pending applications, 896 lack an uploaded photo and 179 are
pending for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for
LiVE.
We have seen a significant drop in applications since the social distancing measures related to the
COVID-19 pandemic went into effect. The number of approved applications per week decreased by 59%
from an average of 231 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 95 in the following
three weeks. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation, we have seen a higher percentage of applicants
who apply for LiVE at the same time as they apply for other benefit programs, or shortly thereafter.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:



LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the

MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application outreach worker helping interested individuals apply
at rotating locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. RTD and
Denver Human Services have agreed to pursue this option.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,

starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone until the offices re-open.

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
RTD outreach staff are pursuing alternative channels of communication since in-person
outreach is not currently an option.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is meeting with homeless services providers to discuss ideas that would eliminate or
shorten the wait time between the LiVE application and the client’s ability to use the
discounted tickets.

Complete and execute the amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City
and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach worker.
Work with the Governor’s Office of Information Technology to determine the detailed
requirements for the planned PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE application and
application processing.
Develop questions for the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the
LiVE program.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.

The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers, partner
organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program. This will include
