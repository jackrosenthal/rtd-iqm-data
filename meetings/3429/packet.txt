2023 Committee Appointments

January 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
January 31, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to ratify the 2023 Standing Committee appointments.

REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors amended the Board Bylaws. Article VI: Committees of the
Board, Section 1: Standing Committees, states that, “Each year the newly elected Executive Committee
will appoint between five and seven Directors to the other standing committees based upon Director’s
stated interest in serving on standing committees, and the Board will ratify the selections.” The amended
Bylaws also provide that the Chairs and Vice Chairs of the other standing committees will be selected by
the members of the committee.
DISCUSSION
In late December 2022, the Board Office solicited feedback from the Board on which standing
committees each Director was interested in serving in 2023. The Board Office compiled responses from
the individual Directors for the Executive Committee to review during the January 12, 2022 Executive
Committee Meeting.
After review and discussion, the Executive Committee made the following standing committee
appointments:
Finance and Planning Committee

Operations and Safety Committee

Performance Committee

Packet Pg. 3

1.4.1

In adopting this recommended action, the Board seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Customer Excellence and Community Value through transparency and candidness.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action.
