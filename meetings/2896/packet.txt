Board Meeting Date: August 13, 2019

Subject:

January 2020 Service Change Proposal

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. The grant for
service on the Route 62 – Commerce City/Dick’s SG Park expires in December 2019 and due to its low
ridership performance, it is proposed for cancellation. With the expiration of grant funding for expanded
service on the Route LD, it is proposed that the Route LD be returned to its pre-grant level of service.
Additionally, a number of service changes aimed at increasing on-time performance and service reliability
are included in these proposals. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these
service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service
change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 65 – Monaco: extend select peak trips to Northfield
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road: extend evening service
Route LX – Longmont/Denver: add one northbound mid-day weekday trip

Routes proposed for service reductions:
Route 62 – Commerce City/Dick’s SG Park: discontinue service, due to low ridership.
Route LD/LX – Longmont/Denver: reduce service midday weekday and Saturday to former levels.

Re:

Service Availability – July 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.62% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in July 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (July) last year. Service delivery has improved significantly
since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





July 2019 – 149.17 hours
July 2018 – 251.48 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 2,404.21 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 8,992.01 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in July were increased summer special events
(such as: Independence Holiday Activities throughout region, Cherry Creek Arts Festival,
Rockies home games, US-36 lane closures, and the Wonder Woman Run) and
planned/unplanned bus bridges (such as: Light Rail wire replacement and CDOT project
closures).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.62% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,327 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 18,616 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.

Re:

61AV- Demonstration Project

Please find the attached final report for the 61AV autonomous shuttle vehicle
demonstration project which recently concluded. As you are aware, this six month
demonstration project launched on January 29, 2019 and concluded on August 2, 2019.
The purpose of this final report is to communicate the background and results of the
demonstration project; as well as to share lessons learned during the planning,
implementation and operation of the autonomous shuttle vehicle that was operated in the
area of RTD’s 61st & Pena rail station. As part of this process, I would like to publically
thank our partners in this project EasyMile (the autonomous vehicle provider), Transdev
(the operator and provider of the on-board Customer Service Ambassador), Panasonic
(co-developer of Pena Station Next), LC Fulenwider (co-developer of Pena Station Next)
and the City/County of Denver (Public Works and DEN). I would also like to thank the
State of Colorado Autonomous Vehicle Task Force (AV Task Force, consisting of
representatives of the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Colorado State
Patrol (CSP) and the Colorado Department of Revenue/Division of Motor Vehicles
(CDOR/DMV)) for providing guidance, assistance and oversight throughout the process.

The 61AV demonstration project provided RTD with valuable information about AV shuttle
technology and what role it may play in RTD’s future service offerings. While a number
of technological challenges, especially related to weather events such as snow, heavy rain,
steam rising from melting snow, etc., were observed during the demonstration period,
staff is impressed by the response of the AV vehicle/technology supplier to address the
issues identified during the demonstration. While the current Generation 1 (Gen1)
autonomous shuttle vehicle may not provide the type of service reliability needed to
operate in a transit service environment, staff was impressed with the response of the
vehicle/technology supplier to address these issues in future generations of AV shuttle
vehicles now coming to market.

The EZ10 Gen 2 vehicle is already on the market and includes a heater to address issues
of operator and passenger comfort as observed during the 61AV demo project; as well as

1.C.5.a

1.C.5.a

Towards that end, RTD has submitted a grant application to the USDOT for funding anther
AV demo project that has been requested by the University of Denver (DU), and
Transportation Solutions TMA to provide a first/last mile connection between DU and the
DU light rail station. Other project partners include C/C Denver and EasyMile. RTD is
interested in continuing to advance our knowledge of AV capability in a more complex
environment, such as a university environment with large volumes of pedestrians,
bicyclists and vehicles.

In addition, this demonstration would include “V-to-I” (vehicle to infrastructure)
technology to allow the AV shuttle vehicles to communicate and integrate with the traffic
signals along the route. The project would also include a market research component
thru DU to conduct pre and post surveys of the campus community, the surrounding
neighborhoods and customers. We continue to receive inquires and requests from other
parties that are interested in partnering with RTD for AV demonstration projects.

improved battery life. The EZ10 Gen3 vehicle is just now starting to be deployed and
includes improved sensor technology to address snow, rain and steam weather events as
observed during the 61AV demo project. The Gen3 vehicle also provides securement
devices for mobility aides and also provides improved battery life to extend vehicle range.
It should be of interest to RTD to investigate the degree to which these new technological
advances do indeed address the issues identified during the 61AV demo project.

Background:

The demonstration project was a partnership between RTD, EasyMile (the autonomous
vehicle provider), Transdev (the operator and provider of the on-board Customer Service
Ambassador), Panasonic (co-developer of Pena Station Next), LC Fulenwider (codeveloper of Pena Station Next) and the City/County of Denver (Public Works and DEN).
The project was conducted within the regulatory framework developed by the State of
Colorado Autonomous Vehicle Task Force (AV Task Force). The AV Task Force was created
as a result of legislation passed by the Colorado State Legislature in 2017 and consists of
representatives of the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Colorado State
Patrol (CSP) and the Colorado Department of Revenue/Division of Motor Vehicles
(CDOR/DMV).The project came about as a result of conversations that had taken place
between the partners since “Autonomous Vehicle Day” in December of 2017. RTD got
involved in the planning of the project in May of 2018.
The goals of the project were:
• To safely introduce an autonomous vehicle on a public roadway in Denver;
• Assess the reliability and availability of an AV shuttle vehicle and its suitability for
a transit application;
• Provide “first/last mile” service to/from an RTD bus/rail station; and
• Align the interests of multiple stakeholders in order to advance the project.
The Service
After six months of Stakeholder Steering Committee meetings and fairly focused
operational planning activities, the demonstration project kicked off on January 29, 2019.
The final route was approximately 1 mile in length and consisted of an essentially circular
route operating in one direction from RTD’s 61st & Pena station, along Richfield Street,
60th Street, N. Salida Street, through the Panasonic building parking lot, N. Panasonic Way
and 61st Street back to Richfield and RTD’s 61st & Pena station. This was the first
deployment of an autonomous vehicle operating in mixed traffic on a public roadway in
the City/County of Denver and in the State of Colorado. This was also one of the first
deployments nationally of an autonomous vehicle operating on a public roadway and
integrated with a transit agency’s service offering.

Attachment: 61AV Demonstration Project 8.13.19 (3902 : 61AV)

On January 29, 2019, RTD and its partners launched the 61AV demonstration project, a
six-month demonstration of a potential “first and last mile solution” using an autonomous
shuttle vehicle. The project connected RTD’s 61st and Pena rail station to the Panasonic
building, an emerging apartment complex (Elevate at Pena Station) and the Pena park-nride, owned and managed by Denver International Airport (DEN).

1.C.5.b

Posted speeds along the streets comprising the 61AV route were 25 mph and there were
relatively low traffic volumes in the developing area. Needed infrastructure improvements
such as ADA accessible stops, curb cuts etc. were provided by LC Fulenwider, as was a
Transportation Engineering Plan (TEP) developed as part of Fulenwider’s development
plan review activities with the City/County of Denver. This plan included the placement of
MUTCD compliant “slow moving vehicle” warning signs along the route to advise motorists
that slow moving vehicles could be encountered in the area. The signage component of
the plan was developed with assistance from RTD, EasyMile and Denver staff and was
approved by the City/County of Denver. The 61AV route and signage was also approved
by the AV Task Force through a review conducted by CSP and CDOT.
The 61AV service operated on 15 minute frequency, Mondays through Fridays between
the hours of 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Service was provided along a predetermined route
and according to a predetermined schedule designed to integrate with RTD rail service at
the 61st & Pena rail station. The 61AV route was treated as any other RTD fixed route
service and information was included in RTD’s fixed route database so that it appeared in
all RTD data streams for the RTD trip planner, next Ride and real time information streams
etc. as we desired to integrate the 61 AV service completely into the RTD service offering
and treat it, and monitor it, as any other RTD fixed route service offering.
61AV service was provided using an EasyMile EZ10, Generation 1 (“Gen 1”) driverless
electric shuttle vehicle with a capacity of 10-12 people. The EZ10 vehicle operates at level
4 level of autonomy (out of 5 levels) per Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
guidelines/definitions. The vehicle operates along a pre-mapped network of roads at an

(insert graphic of route)

1.C.5.b

A Customer Service Ambassador (CSA), provided through a contract with Transdev, was
on board the 61AV vehicle at all times to ensure safety and to answer customer questions
regarding the vehicle and/or service. The CSA also provided various reports to assist with
the monitoring of the service and also took manual control of the EZ10 vehicle when
necessary to maneuver the vehicle around unplanned obstructions such as construction
vehicles given the nature of the specific route. If conditions resulted in the inability of the
EZ10 to operate due to any reason, the CSA replaced the EZ10 vehicle with a RTD provided
body-on-chassis (or “cutaway”) vehicle so as to always meet the commitment to our
customers to provide the service.

Packet Pg. 34

operating speed of approximately 10-12mph. The EZ10 vehicle is equipped with a built-in
automatic access ramp to provide access for individuals with disabilities, but the Gen 1
vehicle did not include securement devices for individuals using mobility aides. RTD and
EasyMile consulted with representatives from the Colorado Cross Disabilities Coalition
(CCDC) during the planning of the service to address issues relative to access for
individuals with disabilities. While some issues were able be addressed during the planning
of the service, not all issues could be resolved with the EZ10Gen1 vehicle prior to project
launch.

1.C.5.b

As discussed, one of the main objectives of the pilot was to demonstrate the AV technology
in a transit application and assess what AV technology could do and what challenges
would exist with utilizing an autonomous vehicle in a transit setting. Towards that end
our metrics were focused on service disruptions and operator interventions, safety (estops) and related issues. We knew that there would be very limited ridership potential
given the very limited employment in the area (about 80-100 folks between Panasonic
and EasyMile offices and no residential population until the apartments opened). The
apartments (Elevate at Pena Station) recently began moving in tenants. From early
February 2019 through July 26, 2019, the 61 AV has generated 597 passenger boardings.
We have had very limited ridership from the park-n-ride and most riders have been folks
coming to see the AV technology and check out the ride. The other objectives of the
61AV project were to navigate the process to actually implement the project on a public
roadway in Colorado (the first project to do so) and to mobilize numerous partners to
work together in order to implement the project. The project was successful in meeting
these goals.
Regarding transit related metrics and the 61AV project, the following results were
generated during the period beginning in early February of 2019 and running through July
26, 2019:
• Service availability (the percent of scheduled 61AV hours that were actually
operated by the AV shuttle in AV mode), when measured on a weekly basis, ranged
from a low of approximately 45% to a high of 99+%. Over the life of the
demonstration project, the 61AV service was provided by the AV vehicle in
Autonomous mode 89% of the time when factoring out non- technology related
issues;
• The primary technology related issues affecting AV service availability were that
the AV sensors read falling snow, heavy rain and/or steam rising from the street
due to melting snow as an obstruction causing the vehicle to stop and therefor the
AV shuttle was replaced by a standard transit vehicle during these events…these
types of weather events resulted in the AV being removed from service on several
occasions during the weeks of 2/25/19, 3/4/19; and 3/11/19 (bomb cyclone etc.).
Heavy winds also caused intermittent service disruptions during the demonstration
period;
• Other events that led to the replacement of the AV shuttle with a body-on-chassis
transit vehicle were severely cold weather events or very hot weather events. The
EZ10 Gen 1 shuttle vehicle that was used had no on-board heater for the operator
or passengers (Gen 2 vehicle being now being deployed does have an on-board
heater, and Gen 3 vehicle to be deployed in Q4 of this year also adds improved
sensors to address weather issues mentioned above as EasyMile works to address
some of the results of our demo). As a result, during very cold weather the 61AV
either lost AV service intermittently as the operator would pull indoors to warm up
else they would replace the AV shuttle vehicle with the transit vehicle in order to
stay warm. Similarly, in very hot weather, the air conditioner would be utilized
resulting in a power drain on the battery resulting in the need to replace the electric
AV vehicle with the transit vehicle in order to complete the scheduled service day.

The Results

•

•

In general, the electric AV vehicle was able to perform approximately 6 hours of
the regularly scheduled 8 hour service day in very hot weather before the batteries
needed to be recharged;
AV performance was very good when operating in “normal” weather conditions
(not very cold and not very hot). Service availability ran in the upper 90%’s in
terms of percent of AV service operated in AV mode, generally in the 95+% range.
Events that led to very minor amounts of AV service loss included events when the
AV continued to operate but in manual override to circumnavigate unplanned/
temporary obstructions impeding the progress of the AV vehicle along the
preprogrammed AV route. These interruptions in AV service were generally caused
by construction vehicles given that there was lots of construction going on in the
area of our demonstration project. These events normally took about 1-2 minutes
per event to circumnavigate the unplanned/temporary obstruction. This is exactly
what is supposed to happen when the AV sensors identify an obstacle in the
preprogrammed route; and
There have been no accidents involving the AV vehicle as it has performed “as
advertised” from a safety perspective. Very quick to respond to obstacles (faster
than a human operator can) and thus very safe. This was especially important in
an area that exhibited fairly high levels of unplanned vehicle activity due to
construction in the area. Safety is one of the key and major advantages of AV
technology.

A complete compilation of project metrics is included as Attachment A.
Project cost
•

•

Out of pocket cost/budget for the six (6) month 61AV demonstration project is
approximately $170,000. All staff time from all project partners (RTD, City/county
of Denver, DEN, EasyMile, Transdev, Panasonic, and Fulenwider) was provided as
in-kind contribution from the partners with no charge to the project; and
Out of pocket cost to RTD will be approximately $16,000. This money supports
regulatory signage/installation and a portion of the ongoing O&M cost. Other
project costs are being borne by EasyMile (provision of AV vehicle), Transdev
(reduced O&M cost for on-board customer service ambassador), Fulenwider
(infrastructure improvements such as ADA compliant AV stop pads etc.), Denver
(regulatory signage poles) and Panasonic/EasyMile (a portion of ongoing O&M
costs).

Lessons Learned
LL1- Stakeholder alignment is key
It is important to identify and involve all of the potential stakeholders from the
beginning/very early on in the process. Provide a detailed introduction as to how AV
shuttle technology works and the process by which AV technology is deployed. Have
meaningful conversations about what each partner is attempting to accomplish and what

Packet Pg. 36

1.C.5.b

1.C.5.b

potential drawbacks might be and reach agreement on project goals. Discuss roles and
responsibilities for project planning and implementation.
LL2- Processes take time

Regulatory• National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)- Due to the fact that AV
shuttle vehicles do not currently meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
(FMVSS) (no steering wheel, no brakes, etc.), vehicles must be approved by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in order to be able to
operate in the U.S.. EasyMile, the AV shuttle provider, took the lead on this
process.
• State of Colorado- AV Task Force (CDOT, DOR/DMV,CSP)- in order for any AV
demonstration/pilot program to take place on public roadways in the State of
Colorado, it is necessary to receive approval from the State AV Task Force. The
AV Task Force consists of representatives from the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT), the Colorado Department of Revenue/Division of Motor
Vehicles (DOR/DMV) and the Colorado State Patrol (CSP). EasyMile took the lead
role in working with the State’s AV Task Force with RTD subsequently joining
EasyMile in the process of working with the AV Task Force to secure project
approval
• Local jurisdiction (City/County of Denver)- While the State of Colorado, through
the AV Task Force, provides the overarching authority and guidance for AV
deployments on public roadways in Colorado, local jurisdictions may request
signage etc. in order to operate AV’s on streets owned and/or managed by the
local jurisdiction. LC Fulenwider took the lead on this process through the City’s
development review process and the Transportation Engineering Plan required by
CCD. This process was supported by staff from RTD, EasyMile (and EasyMile’s site
assessment report) and CCD Traffic Engineering as well as by CDOT staff. The
outcome was a signage plan advising area motorists of the possibility of
encountering slow moving vehicles along the AV route.
• Denver International Airport- DEN also had a regulatory process in place to guide
potential deployments of AV technology on DEN property. RTD took lead in
securing DEN “Rule 41” approval with assistance from DEN staff.
Contractual• RTD/Transdev- level 4 autonomous vehicles still require that a person be onboard
the vehicle at all times that the vehicle is in operation. This contract was negotiated
and entered into by representatives of RTD and Transdev. RTD chose to contract

The process behind the implementation of the 61AV demonstration service can generally
be broken down into roughly 5 broad/general categories or steps:

1.C.5.b

•

Project Pre-Planning
• Finalization of AV route and schedule- actually part of an iterative process as it is
a component of the regulatory process by which the AV Task force approved the
project including final approval of the route by the CSP and AV Task Force.
Includes the Site Assessment Report (SAR) conducted by EasyMile, traffic analysis
conducted by RTD staff and local jurisdiction traffic engineering staff and, in the
case of 61AV project, the TEP prepared by Fulenwider as part of the CCD
development review process for Pena Station Next.

Project Implementation
•

Infrastructure improvements – construction of ADA compliant AV stops,
installation of project required signage and vehicle storage and charging facilities.
In the case of the 61 AV project, Fulenwider provided construction of ADA
compliant stops and curb cuts etc. RTD produced and installed project signage
and Panasonic/Easymile provided for vehicle storage and charging facilities.
• First Responder Training- training was conducted by both the project team as well
as by CSP personnel for Denver Police and Denver Fire Department personnel to
ensure that first responders were familiar with the AV shuttle vehicle should they
need to respond to an emergency situation;
• Operator (CSA) training including:
• AV technical vehicle training
o Pre-trip
o Autonomous mode
o Manual mode
o Environmental hazards
o Post-trip including data collection
o Route training
o Customer service
o AV test trip
• Service training
o Route, schedule and time points
o Hand held radio procedures
o Communications with RTD Dispatch

•

with Transdev through an existing fixed route service contract that existed
between RTD and Transdev.
Vehicle procurement- the decision to buy or lease the AV vehicle must be made
by any AV service provider. The procurement process must then be implemented.
In the case of the 61AV, EasyMile provided the vehicle lease at extremely reduced
(no) cost.
Funding- amount of financial contribution and flow of funds must be determined
and agreed upon by all parties involved.

LL3 Proactive marketing and communications are vital
A dedicated marketing and communications steering committee with representation from
all project stakeholders was created to help identify key ideas and messages, key dates
for project marketing and communications activities and other marketing and
communications needs for the 61AV demo project. Meetings need to start early enough
in the project to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of project goals and objectives
and AV technology. Communications between the committee and the stakeholder steering
committee/project team is vital to ensure that all project activities are aligned. Activities
undertaken as part of the 61AV demonstration project included:
Marketing and Communications
• Public information-route/schedule into trip planner, real-time info, etc.
• Public information- website, FAQ’s etc.
• Public information- media advisories, public relations, etc.
• Public/internal communications- info to TIC
• Internal communications- information flows in Operations and other parts of
RTD organization (dispatch etc.)
• Project launch
o location and time/date
o invitations
o speakers
o facilities (room, chairs, tables, AV, etc.)

LL4 Budget for all necessary project elements
As projects of this complexity and magnitude evolve, numerous activities are often
overlooked at the outset of the project. It is necessary to identify all project costs and
sources of revenue at the outset of the project.

Marketing and communications activities (see Lessons Learned #3 below)

1.C.5.b

This 61AV project provided RTD with valuable information about AV shuttle technology
and what role it may play in RTD’s future service offerings. While a number of AV service
disruptions were observed during the demonstration period due technological challenges,
especially related to weather events such as snow, heavy rain, steam generated by
melting snow, etc., staff is impressed by the response of the AV vehicle/technology
supplier to address issues identified during the demonstration. While the current
Generation 1 (Gen1) vehicle may not provide the type of reliability needed to operate in
a transit service environment, staff was impressed with the response of the
vehicle/technology supplier to address these issues in future generations of AV shuttle
vehicles now coming to market. The EZ10 Gen 2 vehicle is already on the market and
includes a heater to address issues of operator and passenger comfort as observed during
the 61AV demo project as well as improved battery life. The EZ10 Gen3 vehicle is just
now starting to be deployed and includes improved sensor technology to address snow,
rain and steam weather events as observed during the 61AV demo project as well as
securement devices for mobility aides. The EZ10Gen3 vehicle also provides improved
battery life to extend vehicle range. It should be of interest to RTD to investigate the
degree to which these new technological advances do indeed address the issues identified
during the 61AV demo project.

Towards that end RTD has submitted a grant application to the USDOT for funding anther
AV demo project that has been requested by the University of Denver (DU), and
Transportation Solutions TMA to provide a first/last mile connection between DU and the
DU light rail station. Other project partners include C/C Denver and EasyMile. RTD is
interested in continuing to advance our knowledge of AV capability in a more complex
environment such as a university environment with large volumes of pedestrians, bicyclists
and vehicles. In addition, this demonstration would include “V-to-I” (vehicle to
infrastructure) technology to allow the AV shuttle vehicles to communicate and integrate
with the traffic signals along the route. The project would also include a market research
component thru DU to conduct pre and post surveys of the campus community, the
surrounding neighborhoods and customers. We continue to receive inquires and requests
from other parties that are interested in partnering with RTD for AV demonstration
projects.
