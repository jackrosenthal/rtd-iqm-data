PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD retains the services of a local government relations public affairs firm to assist staff with advocacy,
communications, and relationship development.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s current local government relations contract with Catalyst Public Affairs number 122RB007 was
executed July 1, 2022, for an initial term of two years and included options to extend the contract
under the original scope for government relations services for an additional three years at the previously
negotiated rate of $99,600.00 per year. Catalyst Public Affairs has met all contractual requirements,
and their performance has met expectations, hence the agency would benefit from executing the
recommended action in alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Financial
Success. No changes to the contract’s statement of work are associated with this recommended action.
If approved, RTD will execute an amendment with Catalyst Public Affairs that will retain local
government relations services through June 30, 2027.

Citizens Advisory Committee Charter Adoption

May 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
May 29, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Charter for the Citizens Advisory Committee
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is a creation of the RTD Board of Directors (Board) comprised of
17 members who are appointed by the Board and tasked with providing advice and serving as a liaison
to their communities. The CAC was created in April of 2004 by the Board with the passing of Resolution
No. 5, Series 2004. This was the same resolution that referred the FasTracks measure to the ballot for
voter consideration. As such, the initial focus of the CAC was to “monitor and provide input on the
improvements for each corridor contained in the [FasTracks] Plan.”
Subsequently, the Board passed a Recommended Action in December of 2005 to “formally establish the
“FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)” with the mission to provide advice on the
implementation of the FasTracks Plan and promote public awareness and understanding of the project.
As the FasTracks buildout and planning phases progressed the CAC was expanded by the Board in
December of 2008 from an initial membership of 11 to a membership of 17. In January of 2016, with
the FasTracks planning phase winding down, the Board removed the phrase “FasTracks” from the name
of the committee and redefined the CAC’s role to provide the Board and RTD with general advice as
opposed to focusing solely on the FasTracks project.
Throughout its existence the CAC’s role has been defined by Recommended Actions adopted by the
Board as opposed to a centralized document, such as a charter. Last August, then CAC Co-Chairs Matt
Applebaum and John Fussa met with then Board Chair Lynn Guissinger, GM/CEO Debra Johnson, and
Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll to engage in a conversation around the role and purpose of
the CAC. That conversation produced a commitment on both sides to examine the role of the CAC and

Packet Pg. 6

1.4.2

to bring forward a proposal for the Board to review in 2024. Since that meeting Board Office Executive
Manager Jack Kroll researched the history of the CAC and crafted a draft charter based on the previous
Board action in 2016 regarding the CAC as well as ideas discussed amongst Board leadership, RTD
leadership, RTD staff, and CAC members. That draft charter was then discussed during a February 2024
meeting of CAC Co-Chairs John Fussa and Bryn Grynwald, RTD Board Chair Erik Davidson, GM/CEO
Debra Johnson, and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll. The draft of charter has been
subsequently refined based on input from the aforementioned stakeholders and has been reviewed and
discussed by the CAC three times. Additionally, the Charter was presented to both the Executive
Committee and the full Board in April for additional input.
INFORMATION
The Executive Committee is asked to review the draft charter, offer any changes, and considering taking
an action to recommend to the full board the approval of the charter. The charter will then move forward
to the full Board as a recommended action.
The charter is built off several concepts contained in the 2016 Board action. Significant changes include:
•
•
•
•
•

Moving the CAC staff support from the Marketing and Communications team to the Board Office,
and specifically designating the Board Office Executive Manager as the main liaison with the CAC
Having the CAC review the Board’s work plans before completing its own work plan
Stating the CAC has the ability to develop operating guidelines subject to the approval of the
Board
Empowering the Chair of the Board to call for recruitment of new CAC members to fill vacancies
Requiring the Board and the CAC to revisit the charter in three years

It should be noted that the CAC will continue to receive significant support from the local affairs
consultant Catalyst, and the Board Office Executive Manger remains in close contact with Catalyst and
the CAC Co-Chairs regarding the planning and production of each CAC meeting.
This recommended action aligns with the Strategic Values of Customer Excellence and Community Value
by helping to create a sustainable and focused future for one of RTD’s best conduits for public input.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to adopting the CAC charter.

Subject:

RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the
name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and
revise the structure accordingly.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide.
Therefore, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the members of the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee recommend the Board revise the structure for the Citizens Advisory Committee as
follows:
Regional Transportation District
Citizens Advisory Committee
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
and business persons from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and
volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Committee Role
The role of the Citizens Advisory Committee shall be to:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – May 2024

May 23, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, April 25, 2024. This report was prepared on
May 16, 2024, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, May 23, 2024.
Federal
The primary focus at the federal level has been on work related to the federal fiscal year 2025 (FFY25)
process. No markups of FFY25 appropriations bills have been scheduled yet. Congress has been working
quickly to submit local projects for potential funding through the House Community Project Funding
process and the Senate Congressionally Directed Spending process. Similar to previous years, RTD has
submitted a request for funding for the Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project through

Packet Pg. 29

1.6.1

Senator Bennet, Senator Hickenlooper, and Representative DeGette. Staff will keep the Board apprised
of the status of this request as Congress continues to develop FFY25 appropriations bills.
State
The Colorado General Assembly’s 2024 regular legislative session concluded on Wednesday, May 8,
2024. As referenced in an email circulated on Thursday, May 9, 2024, below is a summary of notable
bills that staff highlighted for the Board’s awareness throughout the legislative session.
HB24-1447 Transit Reform
The bill never received a final hearing in the Senate Appropriations Committee and therefore was not
passed during the 2024 legislative session. One section of HB24-1447 that removed the state
requirement for RTD to receive fair market value when leasing land was added in the closing days to
SB24-214, which passed.
SB24-184 Support Surface Transportation Infrastructure Development
This bill was passed and signed into law. As a result of this bill, which uses car rental fees to fund
surface transportation infrastructure projects, RTD is required to coordinate with Front Range Passenger
Rail District, Colorado Department of Transportation, and High Performance Transportation Enterprise to
assist in a series of reports related to Northwest Rail and the designated first phase of front range
passenger rail service from Denver to Fort Collins. The first report is due Friday, September 20, 2024,
with a subsequent report due in March 2025.
SB24-230 Oil and Gas Production Fees
This bill was passed and signed into law. The bill creates an oil production fee, which will begin to be
collected commencing Monday, July 1, 2025. The bill designates that 80% of the fees collected will be
distributed to transit and passenger rail operations and capital expenses through three separate
programs:
• 70% of the transit/passenger rail funding will be distributed by formula that will be developed by
the Clean Transit Enterprise Board
• 10% will go to a competitive grant process and can be used on operations, capital, and planning
new regional transportation authorities
• 20% of the fund will be available to passenger rail projects that meet certain regional and
statewide goals.
Lastly, the bill requires RTD to produce a report by July 1, 2025, outlining how the agency can complete
the unfinished aspects of FasTracks by 2034.
SB24-032 Methods to Increase the Use of Transit
This bill was passed and signed into law. The bill appropriates $5 million to RTD for use on transit
operations, so long as the agency offers a zero-fare for youth program for an entire year. Given state
funding constraints, the bill did not appropriate sufficient monies to fund RTD’s Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative in 2024. Lastly, the tax credit for employers to provide transit passes to employees was
removed from SB24-032 and amended into HB24-1036, which passed.

1.6.1

Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. On May 1, 2024, RTD announced the opening of the application period for the 2024
Partnership Program. The notice and information related this year’s application process were sent to all
local elected officials as well as to members of the Subregional Service Councils. Staff welcome the
opportunuty to collaborate with jurisdictional partners to answer any questions related to the Partnership
Program.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed Bylaw Amendment to Allow Chair to Appoint
Committee Members in Event of a Vacancy

May 23, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On October 26, 2021, the Board approved Bylaw amendments that changed the composition of the
Board’s committees as well as how Directors became members of a given committee. The process
approved in October of 2021 currently governs how committee appointments are made. Currently, the
Executive Committee makes the committee appointments, typically at a Special Executive Committee
Meeting in early-to-mid January each year, and those appointments are then ratified by the full Board at
the regular Board meeting later that month.
While this system has worked well, it does not account for a vacancy arising on a committee following
the initial appointments. This year, Director Lewis was sworn into his Director office on February 27,
2024, to fill the seat vacated by former Director Williams on January 10, 2024. However, Director
Lewis was not able to serve on a standing committee his first month on the Board as there was neither a
vacancy nor a process to place him into a committee assignment before the Executive Committee met in
March. To accommodate Director Lewis coming onto the Board, Director Buzek stepped down from
what was then known as the Operations and Safety Committee at the conclusion of its March 13,
2024, meeting. The Executive Committee then appointed Director Lewis to the Committee on March 21,
2024, and the full Board ratified the appointment at its March 26, 2024, meeting.
The proposed amendment to the Bylaws allows the Chair to make a committee appointment in the event
of a committee membership vacancy arising after the Executive Committee’s annual process to appoint
committee members, thus avoiding a situation whereby a new Director is not afforded the opportunity to
serve on a committee for some period of time following their appointment to the Board.
Additionally, the July 13, 2022, Operations and Safety Committee meeting was cancelled due to a lack
of quorum. This resulted in the need for a Special Board Meeting to be calendared for July 26, 2022.
The proposed Bylaw amendment would also allow the Chair to avoid similar situations by making a
temporary appointment to a committee for purposes of ensuring a quorum. This ability could also be
utilized to temporarily appoint a committee member in the event of a prolonged temporary absence of a
Director from their duties.

Packet Pg. 32

1.6.2

INFORMATION
The Executive Committee is asked to discuss the following Bylaw amendment and offer any feedback.
Following the Committee’s discussion this item will be shared with the full board for input. The item is
then anticipated to return to the Executive Committee as a recommended action at its June 2024
meeting.
Proposed Bylaw Amendment to Article VII, Section 5, to add:
In the event of non-temporary vacancy on a standing committee, which arises after the Executive
Committee’s annual action to appoint standing committee members, the Chair shall have the
power to appoint a member of the Board to a standing committee of the Board. This appointment
shall take effect at the time of the Chair’s notification to the Board of the appointment, is subject
to ratification by the full board, and shall remain in effect until the Executive Committee acts the
following year to appoint Board members to standing committees. Additionally, to ensure a
quorum will be present for regularly scheduled meetings of a standing committee, the Chair shall
have the ability to temporarily appoint a member of the Board to that standing committee, and
this appointment shall be in effect from the time the Board is notified of the appointment to the
end of the committee meeting(s) for which the member was appointed.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Community Value as the Board must ensure the
community is appropriately represented and that meetings of the Board are not cancelled due to a lack of
quorum.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to RTD for the Board to review and/or amend its Bylaws.

convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or other laws, together with those that are
adopted under delegated authority, are combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any
omission from them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty, or responsibility
to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the RTD Act or other applicable laws as they
now exist or may be amended.
ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS
The terms “district,” “board,” “director,” “publication,” “mass transportation system,” and other terms defined in
the RTD Act, and used in these Bylaws, shall have the same meaning as in the RTD Act unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning. “State Audit” as used in these Bylaws means the performance audit conducted by
the Office of the State Auditor in 2009 and 2010 and reported to the state Legislative Audit Committee in March
2010.
ARTICLE II – BOARD OF DIRECTORS
All powers, privileges, and duties vested in or imposed upon the District shall be exercised and performed by and
through the Board, whether set forth specifically or implied in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate to officers
and employees of the District any or all executive, administrative, and ministerial powers.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Public Opinion Polling Presentation

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Discussion by the Board of Directors during its March 25, 2023, Retreat resulted in a policy goal to
shore up RTD’s financial position and outlook with a policy goal to create a long-term, sustainable, and
resilient funding model. During the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, Director Erik
Davidson and the Chief Financial Officer presented a Discussion Item regarding a Board revenue
diversification policy goal. To support the Board’s policy goal, on August 22, 2023, the General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO) informed the Board via memorandum that a cross-matrix Revenue Diversification
Working Group (RDWG) was formed. Following a Discussion Item at the September 12, 2023, Finance
and Planning Committee meeting regarding the need to investigate revenue diversification and other
financial risk mitigation strategies, the RDWG began meeting in October 2023.
The RDWG is charged with making informed recommendations to the Board regarding opportunities for
revenue diversification, fiscal policy enhancements, and other financial measures to support the longterm fiscal sustainability of RTD in accordance with the Strategic Priority of Financial Success. This
includes an assessment of means to address possible financial impacts to RTD related to the Taxpayer’s
Bill of Rights (TABOR). One potential strategy to ensure the agency’s financial sustainability is a ballot
measure that would continue the authorization originally approved by voters in 1999 for RTD to retain
sales and use tax and other revenues (ballot measure) without imposing a new tax or increasing the tax
rate.
On September 26, 2023, the Board approved a summary scope of work and authorized the GM/CEO to
enter into a contract for consulting services for strategic advice, development of a survey instrument,
and public opinion polling related to revenue diversification and RTD finances to garner an understanding
of public opinion related to a potential ballot measure. RTD contracted with New Bridge Strategy.
DISCUSSION
During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 14, 2024,
representatives from New Bridge Strategy will present information and key findings from the public
polling, including core perceptions of RTD and reactions to a potential ballot measure. The information
being compiled by the RDWG and the polling results presented by New Bridge Strategy are exploratory,

Packet Pg. 55

2.7.1

and no decisions have been made on what, if any, funding avenues to pursue, including whether to
submit a ballot question to registered voters in a future election.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.

Methodology

New Bridge Strategy conducted a survey among N=600 Colorado registered voters
from April 17-23, 2024.
Interviews were conducted via live telephone interviews (both cell phones and
landlines) and online. Interviews were distributed proportionally throughout the
District. Quotas were set for key demographic sub-groups, such as gender, age
and ethnicity.
The survey was also translated into Spanish by GP&P Communications Consulting
and respondents had the option of taking the survey in either English or Spanish.
The margin of error is +4.0% for the overall sample. The margin of error will vary
for sub-groups.

It’s critical that we continue to provide more transit options to relieve the pressure on our roads

RTD needs to be able to continue to provide local residents with choices in how they get to

Every county in the Denver metro area received a grade of F for failing by the American Lung
Association for high ozone days. Poor air quality is associated with asthma, heart disease and
lung illnesses. By ensuring we continue to have a network of zero-emission transportation
