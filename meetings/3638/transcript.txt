Executive Committee Meeting
ERIK DAVIDSON: Hello, everyone. The Thursday, May 23rd executive committee will now come to order.
We are convened as of 12:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. This is Chair Davidson speaking. I would
respectfully ask everyone attending this meeting to please mute yourself unless you are recognized to
speak.
Please know that the committee meetings of the RTD Board of Directors will be held remotely via Zoom,
and our audio and video recorded. The meeting recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the
meetings, will be posted as soon as practicable on the Board's website.
During today's meeting, we are also providing Communication Access, Real Time translation, also known
as CART. Anyone who would like to access this service should please send an email to the RTD Board
Office at rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com and a link will be provided. Additionally, the CART transcript can
be automatically translated into Spanish for anyone who would like to access a live transcript of this meeting
in Spanish.
A live stream of this meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page. I will now call for the roll of
committee members. First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Here.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Second Vice Chair Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Here.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Secretary Guzman.
MICHAEL GUZMAN: I am present. I don't believe CART is working, though. Just a heads up.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. I'll check on that in a moment after finishing the a roll here. Treasurer
Bouquet.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Present.
ERIK DAVIDSON: And this is Chair Davidson. I am also present. That is all five committee members
present. I would note, for the sake of the record, that we are also joined by directors Sloan and Tisdale.
Thank you for joining us, and as usual, I will ask the Board Office's assistance in noting the presence of
any other directors should they join.
At this moment, I just would like to pause. I do believe that, as directors will note, we will have an executive
session later in this meeting where we will have CART services. But at this time, I'll just pause to see if the
Board Office, do we have an issue with CART services running at this time, as noted by Secretary Guzman?

JACK KROLL: Yes, Director Davidson, thank you for the question. What I'm seeing here is that I don't
actually see that the CART transcription-JILLIAN KNAPP-RHODES: (WHISPERING) Jesus Christ.
JACK KROLL: Oh, Jillian. The CART transcriptionist is not here. There's probably just an issue with her
being in the-- or him being in the wrong Zoom room. There's been a lot of coordination with the executive
session forthcoming and ensuring confidentiality. So let's just, if you'd like, we can pause for a moment
while we get the CART individual here into this room, if that pleases the chair. And then once they're here,
we can proceed.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yes, that's fine. I'll pause for a minute here, and then if-- we do have a lot to get through,
so I'll check with committee members whether it's OK to proceed. But yeah, let's hold for a moment here.
Mr. Kroll, if you could please advise when and if the issue is addressed, or if it will not be able to be done
promptly.
JACK KROLL: Yes, give me one moment here.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for the patience. We'll hold for a minute.
JACK KROLL: Chairman Davidson, Jillian is reaching out to the CART individual. I know they were just on
the phone not less than a half hour ago, and so I think it's best to proceed at this time, unless there are any
firm objections to doing so, as the timeline still is TBD to know when that individual will join via the link they
were previously sent.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. Kroll. Are there any objections from committee members to proceeding
with the meeting without CART services at this time? And then we will, again, pause when we enter the
executive session.
DOUG TISDALE: Point of order, Mr. Chairman.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Please Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes, I will note, for the sake of the record and for those who are on the meeting, that the
captioning service on Zoom is functioning and you can just click on Show Captions at the bottom of your
screen in order to have those captions at least.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you for noting that, Director Tisdale. With that being noted that captions are
available via the Zoom service, and noting no objections from committee members, we will proceed with
the agenda. We'll move to the public's comment section of the agenda. I would like to open the public
comments to anyone who would like to address the committee regarding any topics listed in the published
meeting agenda for the current and immediately preceding month.
If you wish to speak and have not done so, you may raise your virtual hand or press star 9 if dialing in on
the phone. During this time, the committee does not offer any direct comments or responses. However, if
you would like to be contacted regarding your public comment, I invite you to please email the RTD Board
Office at the email address rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com.
Mr. Kroll, if I could ask for your assistance in checking? I do not see any hands raised, but are there any
hands raised for public comment.

JACK KROLL: Chairman Davidson, I do not see anyone here who has raised their hand in indication of
their desire to provide public comment.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you very much. And, Mr. Kroll, were any emailed comments received for today's
meeting?
JACK KROLL: There were no email comments received in advance of today's meeting.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. Kroll. Seeing no participants in the queue, and acknowledging that no
emailed comments were received. I will now close the public comment period at this time. We will now
move to item three on our agenda, which is an executive session. We will move into an executive session
portion of our agenda.
I'm going to ask for a motion to move into executive session pursuant to Section 24-6-402(4)(f)(I) CRS for
consideration of personnel matters regarding the status of General Manager and CEO Debra A Johnson's
2024 performance goals and performance feedback from the board of directors and discussion of the same.
Do we have a motion?
JULIEN BOUQUET: So move, Bouquet.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I had the motion as Bouquet. And the second, was that Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ERIK DAVIDSON: And the second is Catlin. Thank you very much. Are there any no votes on this action.
With five aye votes, zero no votes, and zero abstentions, that motion will pass.
The committee has voted to move into executive session. I'd like to remind board members and General
Manager and CEO Johnson to move into the executive session room. The executive session will only be
for board members and General Manager and CEO Johnson. We will start promptly, so board members
and general manager, CEO Johnson, please leave this Zoom and enter the other executive session Zoom
at this time.
For staff and members of the public who are in attendance for the public portion of this meeting, please
remain here on this Zoom link, and we will return at the conclusion of our executive session with the General
Manager and CEO. Thank you.
JACK KROLL: And I'll just note, Danielle is here from Visible Voices, and, Danielle, if you could, at this time,
also leave this Zoom room and transition over into the executive session, Zoom where they will get started
as soon as everyone is available. Once that Zoom concludes, once the executive session Zoom concludes,
Danielle, you'll return to this room to finish the meeting here for the public portion.

ERIK DAVIDSON: Hello, everyone. Thank you for the patience here as we come back from executive
session. Taking a look here. I see that we do have a quorum of our executive committee members, so we
will reconvene. We are reconvened as of 1:38 PM for the sake of the record.
Thank you for those that have been holding for us while the board convened an executive session. We will
now move to the agenda. I do recognize that we are a little bit pressed for time, so I'll ask that we be efficient
in considering the recommended actions today. I'd like to first move into our first recommended action.
There are two this afternoon, and as a reminder for the committee staff and anyone watching or listening,
any action that's passed through the executive committee, even if the vote is unanimous, will be included
on the Board agenda under recommended actions so that the full Board will have the opportunity to discuss
the measure presented.
The first action item under consideration is the Catalyst Public Affairs contract extension amendment for
the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute an
amendment to exercise the option to extend the current local government relations contract with Catalyst
Public Affairs for three years through and including June 30th, 2027. Do we have a motion?
LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Second?
PEGGY CATLIN: I'll second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I have Guissinger and Catlin. I would like to ask our government relations officer, Mr.
Michael Davies, to please present this item. Thank you for the patience and waiting for us to return to public
session. Mr. Davies, the floor is yours.
MICHAEL DAVIES: Thank you, chair. Michael Davies, government relations officer. As you mentioned,
seeking an authorization to execute an amendment to exercise the options on our current contract through
June 30th, 2027. As the project manager, I've worked with Catalyst for the last two years. Found them to
be an excellent resource and absolutely fulfilling the expectations outlined in the original contract and the
deliverables that are outlined in that contract.
Not much more else to say, but happy to answer any questions on this item. I'll stop there. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. Davies. Very much appreciate it. Catalyst has been tremendously helpful
during the busy legislative session we came out of. At this time, I'm going to just, in the interest of time,
open up to committee members for questions that will influence decision on your vote. Lynn, please go
ahead. I'm sorry, director, we just came out of executive session. First, second vice chair Guissinger, please
go ahead.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It's fine. I don't have any questions. I totally agree with-- I think they're doing a great
job. Jen's doing a great job. I suggest we invite Jen to come in and talk to the board for-- briefly, so people
can see her, and she can talk about some of the work she's doing. She is focused on education on our
TABOR and some of our financial issues right now, and I think that's really important. Thanks.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you very much, Director Guissinger. Appreciate the feedback. I think that's a great
idea, and I have taken that as a note. Again, any other questions from committee members that will impact
your decision on the vote? Hearing none. Are there any no votes on this action? All right. With five ayes,
zero no votes and zero abstentions, that motion will pass.

We'll move to our second recommended action for the committee's consideration. This is for the Citizens
Advisory Committee Charter adoption. This is for the Board of Directors to adopt the attached charter for
the Citizens Advisory Committee. Do we have a motion?
MICHAEL GUZMAN: So moved.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I heard, I think, was that Guzman and Guissinger I heard. I would now like to ask Mr.
Jack Kroll, our Executive Manager of the Board Office, to please present this item.
JACK KROLL: Thank you, Chair Davidson. I'll be very brief in my remarks. This is Jack Kroll, Executive
Manager of the Board Office. This is effectively the same document you all saw and discussed last month
with one change.
In revisiting some of the initial documents that formulated the original CAC, I noticed that there were some
language in there that indicated when the term started and ended, and so I've added some language here
that states terms shall commence on January 1 or upon the date of appointment if appointed to fill a
vacancy, and end on December 31 of the third year following the term's commencement. Other than that,
this is effectively the same document you all saw and were briefed on last month. So with that, I'm happy
to take any questions.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. Kroll, very much. Thank you for highlighting the changes, and thank you
very much for bringing this forward as discussion items so that we can review this and get familiar with it
prior to voting. And thank you for shepherding this effort.
Again, in the interest of time, I'll ask for any committee members with questions that will impact your decision
on the matter at hand. Secretary Guzman, please.
MICHAEL GUZMAN: I just have one question, a couple comments. Operations and Safety and Security
Committee needs to be corrected. That's a technical thing. But under the guidelines for how this advisory
committee is to be impaneled and the criteria that we look at, I would like to engage on a conversation
about geographical location within the district being one of the criteria so that we don't have a group of
members that are concentrated in one sole area of the RTD.
And I am not sure how to affect that thought through this process, but it is something to contemplate. And
I found one other error, but I will contact Jack about that directly because it's just a typographical error.
Thanks.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Secretary. Mr. Kroll, any reaction or thoughts to anything from Secretary
Guzman?
JACK KROLL: Yeah, thank you, Director Davidson and Director Guzman-- or Chair Davidson. Director
Guzman's question is actually really timely. Jen Webster, Catalyst, Colleen Roberts at Peak who assist in
supporting the CAC, in addition to my role with the Board Office, had the very same question with respect
to geographic location.
And we reviewed old documents because we were almost certain that there was some kind of geographic
requirement for members of the CAC, and actually there was not. It would be a fairly easy item to add under

membership, to simply add a bullet point and say that the selection committee and the membership should
strive to ensure geographic diversity in the membership of the CAC or something to that effect.
Given where we're at in this process, perhaps I could work with Director Guzman on formulating that
specifically, and then we would bring it as an amendment in the meeting next week.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Kroll. I think that's a great suggestion, that if this is close enough,
we can pass it through committee here and then propose an amendment as recommended by staff.
Secretary Guzman, would that address your concern, and does that sound like a plan of interest to you?
MICHAEL GUZMAN: Yeah, even if we passed it, and we had to amend it later, it's just something I want
everybody to think about because unintended consequences lead to issues later. So if we're thoughtful
about it before we do it, then we won't run up against that. That's all I was suggesting. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yeah, thank you. I'd certainly be supportive of that. Having served on a selection
committee, I think it actually helped to have some of that type of criteria in the process. So thank you,
Secretary and Mr. Kroll. I'm supportive of that amendment.
I see Director Ruscha, your hand is raised. If you could just please keep your comments very brief, since
we need to take the vote at the executive committee here to move to the board. This will come before the
full Board, but, Director Ruscha you're recognized.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I do notice that you asked me to keep my comments brief, but
I'll keep them brief. I just wanted to know if I-- if the Chair or Mr. Kroll would be interested. I'm happy to
advance best practices regarding geographic and general diversity regarding advisory committees or transit
agencies that have been provided by the FHA, FTA, and other various acronyms, if that would be helpful.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Certainly. Thank you, Director Ruscha. Yeah, please. Thank you. Please direct those
comments to the Board Office, and, Mr. Kroll, thank you for being willing to help pull those together to frame
an Amendment for Tuesday. Without seeing no further questions or discussion, are there any no votes on
this action to pass, as is, this committee, the Citizens Advisory Committee charter for adoption?
Being none. That will be five aye votes, zero no votes, and zero abstentions. We look forward to hearing
any recommended amendments at the board meeting. Speaking of the board meeting, we'll move to the
May board meeting agenda review. Is there a motion to move the May board agenda to the Board meeting
on Wednesday, May 29th?
MICHAEL GUZMAN: So moved.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Guzman and Guissinger, thank you very much. Is there any further discussion on the
board agenda? Seeing none. Are there any no votes to move the agenda forward? Being none, That will
pass with five aye votes, zero no votes, and zero abstentions.
I would just like to remind everybody there is one other matter. There are discussion items here as well.
Before moving forward, is there anything further here? I'd like to remind everyone that the Memorial Day
holiday has impacted the timing of our monthly board meeting, and therefore, our board meeting will be on
Wednesday instead of Tuesday of next week.

Also, as a reminder, we have a special board meeting prior to the regular board meeting. This meeting, the
special board meeting, will commence at 3:00 PM Mountain Daylight time, and it will include an executive
session to discuss the initial findings from the Office of the State Auditor regarding the 2023 to 2024
performance audit, as well as to receive legal advice regarding the e-Line incident north of Southmoor
station. These are important conversations, so I will ask that all board members please attend.
There are two discussion items on the agenda this evening, and one matter that I did want to touch upon
in other matters. I do recognize that we are coming up against time. However, I would like to ask for at least
the first discussion item to ensue, and this is the monthly Government Relations report. So Mr. Michael
Davies, I would like to now call on you to give your monthly report to the committee. The floor is yours.
MICHAEL DAVIES: Thank you, chair. Michael Davies, the Government Relations officer. I'll present a brief
Government Relations report starting at the federal level. As noted in the written report, really, the focus
with Congress is to begin the federal fiscal year 2025 appropriations process. At the time of writing the
report, there had been no committees scheduled, but there has been some work in the House that has
ensued since.
So, June 27th, the subcommittee, the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development subcommittee will
hold their markup of the federal fiscal year 2025 bill. It's similar to last year's process, where the majority in
the House has offered a spending bill that does not adhere to agreed upon bipartisan terms for
appropriations bills. So I imagine a lot of work will get done through the House and Senate negotiations as
time goes on here.
But there will be a markup on June 27, and then the full committee, full House Appropriations Committee
is scheduled for July 10th to advance that to the floor of the House. And then also, as noted in the federal
section, RTD did apply for community project funding in the House and the Senate congressionally directed
spending process.
This is essentially the process that replaced earmarks from several, several years back in Congress, and
RTD has applied successfully for funding through this process for the rail reconstruction, the downtown rail
reconstruction project, and did so again for the federal fiscal year 2025.
Good news that was not included in the written report, but both Representative DeGette and Senator
Bennet have advanced our request to the Appropriations Committee. So it's just a really key step to even
being eligible to receive that funding, so really appreciate the support of both those offices to support RTD
in seeking some funding for that project. So I will definitely keep the board up to date as that moves forward.
At the state level, as you all know, the state's 2024 regular legislative session has concluded. I'll just say,
at the beginning of this session, I certainly could not have imagined a session where the state would have
advanced such robust funding for transit.
And so just to highlight a few of the good things that have come out of the session, in Senate Bill 32, RTD
is eligible to receive $5 million to continue the Zero Fare for Youth program, and so that was certainly
something that RTD advocated for in the interim. So I think that was great news and great to work with
legislators at the Capitol in advancing funding for that.
As you all know, Senate Bill 230, which is oil and gas production fees, these fees will go or are largely
eligible for transit and passenger rail projects. As noted in the written report, those fees don't start getting

collected until July 1st, 2025, and then really, it's a process with the Clean Transit Enterprise Board to
develop a formula and a process to apply for those funding dollars.
So it will be some time before RTD will be able to have access or really understand how much funding is
there. But obviously, we'll follow that very closely and work with the Clean Transit Board on that. And then
lastly with SB 184, that bill did put some fees on rental cars, on the daily use of rental cars, and those fees
will go into an existing enterprise controlled by the CTIO within CDOT and, and those funds are available
to all surface transportation projects.
And largely what they did in that bill was just amend the definition of surface transportation to include transit
and passenger rail projects. Again, it will take some time to see those fees don't start getting collected until
January 1st, 2025, so it'll take some time to see how the CTIO and the enterprise board there roll those out
and make those available to projects throughout Colorado.
And then lastly, there are a number of reports associated with both SB 230 and SB 184 that RTD will have
to work on. One being largely a report on unfinished FasTracks projects and how RTD we can finish those
unfinished FasTracks projects by 2034. And that report is due July 1st, 2025.
And then of course, a number of reports that RTD will work on in collaboration with CDOT, Front Range
Passenger Rail, and CTIO with regards to passenger rail between Denver and Fort Collins. That, of course,
includes the Northwest Rail corridor.
And the first report there due is September 30th, 2024. So not too many months here in the future, there
will be some collaborative work with those entities moving forward here. And then lastly, just at the local
level, just wanted to make note for everybody on the board that our partnership program, Call for Projects
partnership program is currently open right now.
And so RTD has done some work to make sure that we've got that information out to local elected officials
and planning staff at all of the cities throughout the municipalities that we work with and make sure they're
aware of that round of funding. And with that, that concludes my report, and happy to answer any questions.
Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Davies, for the report. I think it's important that we had that
report despite the late in the meeting time here. So thank you for your patience and for delivering that. I'll
ask my board colleagues to please route any questions that they might have regarding the Government
Relations update through the Board Office, and also please feel free to copy me in.
We are a little tight on time, so I would like to make sure that we take questions offline there. I believe that
many of what you touched on, Mr. Davies, this Board will be talking about with staff, especially as it relates
to many of these reports coming forward. And I see General Manager and CEO Johnson nodding, so
certainly, the committee and the Board has my commitment to work to agendize what will be necessary to
discuss as it relates to the impacts from the legislation moving forward.
With that, we're going to close out discussion item. Mr. Davies, thank you for being here. I do want to move
to-- we have a number of people who have hard stops at 2:00. I want to ask that we move the proposed
second discussion item, which is the proposed bylaw amendment to allow the chair to appoint committee
members in event of a vacancy, to next month's executive committee. I believe it's important to discuss
that, but we aren't anticipating any vacancies, and this is somewhat of a simple change to adjust this.

Do I have any objections from the Committee to move that item to next month? Being none. We'll go ahead
and do that, and I just would like to thank and acknowledge the work of Mr. Kroll and his team at the Board
Office for preparing that.
I do want to close out with one other matter that I want to touch on, and then we can entertain a motion to
adjourn. There is an important matter concerning two communication challenges that it's incumbent upon
us to address and solve. There have been some communications regarding this. This is with respect to
board, to staff communications, and interactions with staff. First, I want to be very clear that the problems
that we would be solving for, and our goal in addressing these matters.
The goal is to address how the board engages with staff to ensure respectful communications, a productive
work environment, and transportation-- I'm sorry, transparent sharing of information that results from any
and all information requests. The goal is not to change what directors communicate, but how we
communicate with staff.
The goal is to foster an environment where we can all, as directors, receive the best and most up to date
information that's available within the agency. As you've heard from both first Vice Chair Catlin and me, we
would like to address two matters. One is the matter concerning dispersed communications, a high volume
of board director requests for information and questions have been asked of the staff through numerous
communication channels.
This makes it difficult for staff to handle requests, particularly at high volumes. It also makes it difficult for
all directors to gain transparent access to any resulting information and can also result in repetitive requests.
It was for those reasons that the Board Office worked diligently to implement the agency response system.
I would like to thank and acknowledge the work of the entire Board Office on the development of that
system. It is the judgment of First Vice Chair Catlin and myself that fully committing to the use of that agency
response system can help us consolidate and organize information. I would like to ask Mr. Kroll if he would
be able to help the board in gaining insight to the volume of requests and the nature of requests, so the
board can have transparency.
But, Mr. Kroll, given the time, I'd like to suggest that we have that as a dialogue at the next Executive
Committee, whereby you can leverage the agency response system to share some information with us
about communications.
The second matter is ensuring that we have respectful and productive communications with staff. First Vice
Chair Catlin and I conferred with General Manager and CEO Johnson to discuss some interim guidelines
that we have shared with the board to engage in communications. But I think what's most important is to
look at the plan going forward.
I would like to suggest that we add a discussion item to the executive committee agenda in June to discuss
an update to the Board Operating Guidelines that would capture how the board of directors best
communicates with staff. June would be an opportunity to solicit input from board directors as to what is
important for engaging in communications.
Then we can enter a drafting phase on board operating guidelines. I am happy to shepherd this in
collaboration with First Vice Chair Catlin, and we would confer and consult with the General Manager and
CEO to get her input and feedback as how to best engage with her staff so that we could then suggest
updated board operating guidelines in July, again, at executive committee, have a discussion both at the

board and staff level at the suggested updated guidelines to then bring forward as a recommended action
to the September executive committee and September Board of Directors meeting to update our board
operating guidelines to more fully commit to our agency response system to organize and consolidate
what's now dispersed communications, as well as to ensure a respectful, productive, safe and healthy
working environment for staff and board.
With that being said, I would just like to briefly open the floor, if First Vice Chair Catlin, given that I've named
you, and we had an opportunity to dialogue about some of this, as well as General Manager and CEO
Johnson, if any comments would like to be made. I'd ask this all to just be very brief, so we can wrap up
the meeting, and I thank everybody for going over some of the hard stops.
So I'll start with First Vice Chair Catlin. Is there anything that you would like to add at this time? And if not,
that's OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, you articulated it quite well. Thank you very much.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. And General Manager/CEO Johnson, anything you would like to address?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chair, for the opportunity. I just wanted to iterate in this
public forum that I am committed to working with the board for the betterment of the people that comprise
this agency. We want to ensure that coordination is not limited as it relates to all representing your
constituencies to the best of your abilities.
We want to ensure that we're all embracing the values upon which this agency adopted, with the operative
word being on respect as it's defined in our agency documents. So with that, I look forward to engaging and
recognizing that we'll be better together once we recognize our contributions collaboratively and to respect
what we all bring to the table. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you very much, General Manager and CEO. And with that, I will invite-- we will
have plenty of opportunities to discuss this in the path forward. I'll invite all directors, committee members,
and otherwise to please submit to me any considerations you have regarding communications between
board and staff to bring to the June discussion item, as well as General Manager and CEO Johnson,
anything you would like to convey, to please go ahead and share those with myself or with First Vice Chair
Catlin.
With that, we are beyond where we I know we had some hard stops. Again, thank you to everybody. Are
there any other matters to discuss at the executive committee? Being none, as a reminder, our next
Executive Committee meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 20th. The committee's work plan calls for
discussions on the two year committee appointments, 2025 retreat planning, and director onboarding
continuing education.
We will also then be moving into bylaw amendment discussion from today regarding vacancy appointments
to committees, and we also will be adding a discussion item related to that latter other matters item I raised
concerning communications. We will also likely have actions to take, and we'll also be considering the
station property naming policy.
Seeing no other discussion, we will adjourn this meeting as of 2:06 PM Mountain Daylight Time. Thank you,
everybody, for going over your 2:00 PMs. Much appreciated. See you all soon.
