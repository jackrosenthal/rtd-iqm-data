Revised Governance Manual

It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee
that the Board of Directors approve the revised RTD Board of Directors Governance
Manual (Governance Manual), as presented to the Finance, Administration, & Audit
Committee.
The Chair further recommends that, should additional changes be made going forward to
any of the documents contained as appendices to the Governance Manual, which changes
would necessitate non-substantive administrative or ministerial changes to the Manual
itself, Board Office staff be permitted to incorporate those corresponding changes to the
Governance Manual with the approval of the Executive Committee, but without the need
for further Board approval.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 –
Strong & Ethical Leadership.
