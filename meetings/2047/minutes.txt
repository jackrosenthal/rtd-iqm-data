roll call and 4 absent. Directors Brohl, James and O’Boyle arrived after roll call. Director Tayer

Recommended Action

It is recommended by the RTD staff that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General
Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a sole source contract
with Denver Transit Construction group (DTCG) to repair and replace the retaining wall and
trackway embankment at the Southwest Corridor Littleton Downtown Station. The amount of
the contact is $775,000. RTD will seek reimbursement from the BNSF Railroad to cover the
cost of all RTD related repairs. In the event that funds are not recovered, RTD’s insurance
policy will cover these costs, subject to the $100,000 deductible.
The FasTracks team, Henry Stopplecamp, John Shonsey and Rick Clarke, provided a
presentation of pictures that showed how the RTD tracks were affected from the derailment.
The incident occurred on January 16 and the RTD team along with the Denver Transit
Construction Group worked around the clock to restore service on February 2, 2009. John
Shonsey introduced John West from the Denver Transit Construction Group who echoed it
was a team effort.
MOTION:

Director Pulliam made the motion to approve
authorization for the General Manager to execute
documents to enter into a sole source contract
with Denver Transit Construction Group for the
repair and replacement for the retaining wall and
trackway embankment at the Southwest Corridor
Littleton Downtown Station.
Director Christopher seconded the motion.

situation and he congratulated the RTD and the
DTCG contractors for their excellent work.

Director McMullen noted we had averted a major
catastrophe if this had occurred earlier and asked
about the finding and analysis being done on this
situation and the previous incident.
Cal Marsella responded this was indeed
remarkable efforts and that they had met with
both railroads, activated an investigation, looking
at mitigation options and both railroads are at the
table with RTD in discussion.
Director McMullen inquired to the type of spill and
wondered if the railroad were obligated to tell RTD
what type of fuel they are carrying. Marla Lien
responded there are Federal regulations but they
do not have to tell RTD per se. Chair Kemp
responded Federal regulations do require that the
cars are plaquered.
Director Christopher and Martinez inquired if the
railroads had expressed any willingness to work
with RTD. John Shonsey responded the railroad
had been cooperative, had provided track 1
exclusively for RTD’s use and had provided
equipment for use.
Marla Lien indicated that our current
indemnification agreement states we will
indemnify them for everything except sole
negligence and no cause has been determined at
this point. However, RTD’s insurance will cover
subject to the $100,000 deductible.
Director Bagley stated there has been the highest
level of cooperation between RTD and the City of
Littleton.
