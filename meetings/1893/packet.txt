BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 12, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: March 18, 2014

Subject:

Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group
24” contracted fixed-route transit services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for
an amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $22,578,190
(option year 1) and $23,750,230 (option year 2), for a total five year amount not to exceed
$107,367,070. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract term, $4,725,730 for
option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of $23,098,814 for the five year period.
This results in a total contract amount not to exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract
period and $130,465,884 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and
responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide
“Group 24” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective on August 17, 2014.
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated by Senate Bill 88-164 revised in 1999 under HB99-1030, revised in 2003 under
HB03-1103, and revised in 2007 under SB07-251, RTD “may implement a system under which up to
fifty-eight percent (58%) of the District’s vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses
pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts.”
In January of 2014, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide contracted fixed-route transit services, referred to as “Group 24”. The Group 24 service
package represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under Contract Group 20,
and includes local and express service in the Denver metro area. The RFP was mailed to 14 firms
who indicated an interest in proposing on opportunities to provide contracted fixed-route services.
Proposals were due on February 26, 2014.
The Group 24 service offering consists of 110 buses operating 35 routes providing approximately
326,000 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in Group 24 is included as
Attachment A. The entire Group 24 service package is currently operated by First Transit.
Implementation of Group 24 service is scheduled to be effective August 17, 2014. The award of
“Group 24” service to First Transit as recommended, will maintain RTD’s current status of providing
approximately 57% of RTD vehicular service by private contractor.
DISCUSSION:
Two (2) proposals were received in response to RFP 14-DH-003 for the Provision of Group 24 Public
Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, and MV Transportation.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 14-DH-003, that RTD award a contract for Group 24 fixed route transit service to First Transit.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria
as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications
and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Dean Shaklee, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Carolyn
Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Zamy Silva,
Manager, SBO; Amanda Murray, Civil Rights Specialist; and Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the two
proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative
criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for
“Experience and Qualifications.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in these
categories, First Transit was the highest rated technical proposal followed by MV Transportation. The
score for the “SBE plan and goal attainment” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD SBO
staff (both First Transit and MV Transportation met the SBE goal) and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and SBE score of each proposal to
determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in First Transit
being the highest rated proposal followed by MV Transportation. First Transit received an overall total
score of 93 (out of 100); MV Transportation received an overall total score of 87. It was the consensus
of the evaluation team that First Transit presented the best proposal in terms of understanding of the
project, proposed management team, proposed organization/business plan/approach to deliver the
requested service.
First Transit was not the lowest priced proposal. The difference in price over the five-year period
between First Transit and MV Transportation was $66,047 or $13,209 per year. The overall rating
represents the evaluation process conclusion that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal
outweighed the strengths of the MV proposal. While the strengths of the MV Transportation proposal
included, experience with “Maximus” maintenance reporting software and a detailed start-up plan, the
MV Transportation proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of vehicle maintenance plan; facility
plan; personnel plan; and the recent/relevant experience (day to day operations) of the managers
proposed.
A key strength of the First Transit proposal was the proposed management team. Under this team’s
leadership, the First Transit Commerce City division consistently meets/exceeds many of the RTD
quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive relationships
with Denver metropolitan area governments and communities. The team is experienced in providing
service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and, consequently, no disruption of service when
transitioning from the “Group 20” contract to the new “Group 24” contract. First Transit also proposed
very detailed maintenance, operations and safety/training plans; and committed to obtaining the ASE
Blue Seal rating with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence by 2016. The local
operation is also supported by experienced professionals at the Regional level.
First Transit provides medical, dental, life, and short-term disability insurance for employees. First
Transit pays 100% of the cost of the employee-only premium for medical insurance and contributes

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

$100 per month toward the employee-plus-one benefit level, and $200 per month toward the family
benefit level. First Transit pays 100% of the cost for life insurance coverage for each full-time
employee, and 100% of the cost of the short-term disability plan for each full-time employee.
First Transit’s proposed first year price for “Group 24” is 6.8% lower than the current contract price of
the “Group 20” contract that it replaces. First Transit’s proposed hourly rates for the five-year period of
the proposed contract range from $60.06 (contract year 1) to $64.70 (contract year 5). The hourly
rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from $61.97-$69.48 (current contract year) to
$65.44-$69.48 (contract year 5). The total five-year proposed price represents a $29.6 million savings
over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the
recommended firm’s proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in
response to the RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of
technical, SBE and price issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and
communicated in the RFP document.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the Group 24 service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for First Transit’s provision of the services is included in First Transit’s Direct Service Cost as
shown in Attachment B.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the adopted
2014 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to MV Transportation, the second ranked proposer. This is not
recommended as it does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation
process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 24 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 12, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 12, 2014

Board Meeting Date: March 18, 2014

Subject:

4th Quarter
Analysis

2013

Customer

Complaint

RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2013. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2012.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding, and the goal for 2013 remains at .0003 complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 4th quarter of 2013, only RTD met the goal of .0003 complaints per passenger boarding. First
Transit Longmont had .0004 complaints per passenger boarding and First Transit Commerce City, First
Transit Denver, and Veolia all had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined
performance for all of the private contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The
combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL playbacks and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.

Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Market Street Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2013, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 2013, the complaints in this category increased 18.8% compared to 2012. In
many cases, CAD/AVL playbacks confirm that buses are on route, but running late. However, from the
passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in this category is 6.4 complaints per
day.
Bus Early – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 8.3% compared to 2012. Playbacks for
“bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible passengers see the prior bus
running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are addressed whenever the
CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The YTD average in this
category is 6.6 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 16

1.C.2

Bus Late – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 18.9% compared to 2012. Improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category is 12 complaints per day.

Careless Driving/Operator – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 25.4% compared to 2012.
On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks are performed to
determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, all of the private
contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on their
buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and
retrained as needed to improve driving performance. The YTD average in this category is 4.2 complaints
per day.

Discourtesy/Operator – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 28.8% compared to 2012. In
the majority of cases, the investigation into these complaints proves the operator not at fault. Video
evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper procedures and treated the customer with
respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare
payment, requesting space in the priority seating area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and
respectful manner and the passengers react in a negative manner. Operators are counseled and
disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate
manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling similar situations in the future. The YTD
average in this category is 10.8 complaints per day.

Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
2013, complaints in this category increased 11.2% compared to 2012. Investigation into
discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The total number of
discrimination-related complaints remains very small and the YTD average is 0.5 complaints per day.

Fare Dispute – For 2013, complaints in this category decreased 7.8% compared to 2012. It appears
passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares to be paid upon boarding.
Investigation into “fare dispute” complaints often shows passengers presented an improper/incomplete
fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The total number of
complaints remains low and the YTD average is 1.3 complaints per day.

Improper Procedure/Operator – For 2013, complaints in this category decreased 6.7% compared to
2012. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a regular basis to ensure
all operators are receiving consistent and accurate information. In addition, the recently completed ADA
refresher training provided information to remind operators of the procedures to follow to ensure
passengers in mobility devices are able to board the bus. In most cases, video evidence shows
operators are following proper procedures. The YTD average in this category is 7.3 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 17

1.C.2

Incorrect Info/Operator –For 2013, complaints in this category increased 14.5% compared to 2012.
However, the total number of complaints in this category remains small and the YTD average is 0.5
complaints per day.

Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 10.5% compared to
2012. In many cases, playbacks for these complaints will confirm buses are on route and on time. It is
possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments
indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay
vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition,
operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a passenger is passed up due to the bus being
full. Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the Service Planning & Scheduling
Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will allow. The YTD average in this
category is 10.1 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2013

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2013 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue
to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. All of the three passenger accidents during the 4th quarter
were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct
proactive retraining to increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the
number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, individually and as a group, did not meet the target of 88.0% Local On-Time
Service in the 4th quarter. RTD is working with the private contractors to use the OTP report to
identify and campaign routes with on-time performance issues. The contractors also report that
they continue to experience route delays due to construction and detours. Increased passenger
loads and associated boarding delays also contribute to running behind schedule. The contractors
continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always tie safety to the
discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING

Packet Pg. 21

1.C.3

The contractors, individually and as a group, did not meet the target of .0003 Complaints per
Boarding in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to investigate and
address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance
and automatic vehicle location software to retrain operators on the importance of good customer
service and continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

4th Quarter Access-a-Ride Performance Report

Information

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership decreased by 3% through the 4th quarter of 2013 compared to the same period
of 2012. Productivity decreased slightly from 1.25 to 1.24 passengers per hour. During the same
period, Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 18%. Total program ridership (Access-a-Ride plus Access-aCab) increased by 1% from 866,488 to 872,980 in 2013 as compared to YE 1012. The increased use
of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased passenger
trips without an increase in Access-a-Ride resources.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased slightly (approximately 2%) during the
fourth quarter of 2013. Access-a-Ride is approximately 10% under budgeted revenue hours through the
fourth quarter of 2013.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the fourth quarter of 2013 decreased as compared to the same period in
2012. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue
meeting this standard of performance. Staff continues to work with our carriers to address operator
shortages.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger decreased through the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period
in 2012. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

4th Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of October, November, and December.
These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police
officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare
evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
Work to install the new and improved network connectivity has been completed at Sports Authority
Field, and additional validators have been installed at 30th and Downing. Plans are in the works for the
platform validator installations at Southmoor, 16th and Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton.
Xerox has provided RTD with an estimated level of effort, schedule and cost for the following SMT Web
Portal Improvements:
 Ticket Management changes that will help manage requests for assistance with SmartCard.
 Increased search capabilities within the web portal
 Inventory Management changes that will create a better audit train of SmartCard transfers from
one warehouse to another.
 User Role enhancements that limit the actions a Web Portal user can access based on their job
responsibilities.
As of the end of February, 2014 over 84,000 CollegePasses have been reloaded with a contract
extension. Over 32,000 EcoPasses have been renewed. Plans are being made to extend the CollegePass
contract to 6 years with an automatic reload starting in May, 2014.
Through the College and EcoPass contract recharge/reload exercise a system constraint has been
identified in the Smart Media Technology. This limitation relates to the number of cards that the system
can process when a SmartCard needs to be deactivated, suspended, recharged or when a monthly
subscription needs to be placed on the card. In working with our vendor Xerox, we have identified
potential solutions to this issue; however the implementation of those solutions will delay the go-live of
MyRide Monthly Passes and Stored Value.
By March 21, 2014 Xerox will be providing cost and impact estimates for the following items:
A method by which we can increase the amount of memory on both bus and platform validators
Estimates for upgrading current validator versions to newer technology
The SMT Program Team has created a capacity model to help predict when an increase of card activity
may occur, which enables the team to transfer storage capacity within the system to accommodate
capacity requirements. The team has implemented this short-term measure as we await the estimates
from Xerox.

Group continues to work to locate the 2 additional validators
which may be out for repairs.
A meeting took place on March 4th to begin planning for the
additional 4 platform validators to be installed at Southmoor,
16th 7 Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton Street. Work is
targeted to begin the end of March or early in the month of
April.
In order to streamline the support of both the bus and
platform validator technology, responsibilities for both types
of validators have been assigned to separate teams. The
Mobile Technology Group will be responsible for
maintenance and repairs on the bus validators and the
Treasury technicians will maintain and support the platform
validators.
New Braille stickers have been designed with the assistance
from members of the Colorado Coalition for the Blind. The
new stickers are currently being manufactured and will be
placed on all the Platform Validators by RTD Treasury Team.
Two hundred sets if the new stickers were delivered to
Treasury on Friday, 3/7/14, and installation is planned to
begin the week of March 10, 2014.

INFORMATION
The FasTracks financial plan anticipates the financing of certain components of FasTracks projects
related to the design, construction, procurement and/or acquisition across the FasTracks corridors. The
RTD Board has previously adopted resolutions related to the financing of certain FasTracks projects.
Specifically, the Board adopted Resolution No. 1744 (Series of 2013) on November 26, 2013 expressing
its intent to raise capital to fully finance the North Metro corridor commuter rail to 124th Avenue through
the issuance of Certificates of Participation (COPs).
Staff is currently preparing for this financing through the issuance of COPs with an aggregate principal
amount of approximately $470 million. The certificates are expected to be issued during the second
quarter of 2014 with the final maturity in 2044. Interest rates have increased since RTD issued
certificates in 2013, but still continue to be attractive for this financing and within the assumptions
previously made in staff’s financial model.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the anticipated May 2014
issuance and sale of the certificates, including assembling financial information related to the District and
begun drafting a preliminary official statement, continuing disclosure agreement, certificate purchase
agreement and the Resolution for issuance of the certificates. Staff expects to present these documents
to the Board in April and request through the Resolution authorization to issue the certificates, to
establish the parameters and to approve agreements required in connection with the issuance of the
certificates. Documents will be made available for review in the Board Office in April.
Staff will request updated credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch for the COPs.
Current credit ratings on outstanding RTD COPs are as follows:
Moody’s: Aa3 with a stable outlook
Fitch: A with a negative outlook
Standard and Poor’s: A- with a stable outlook
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, Butler Snow
LLP as Bond Counsel and Hogan Lovells and Bookhart & O’toole as Disclosure Counsel in regard to the
COPs. The COPs will be underwritten by a team including J.P. Morgan (55%), Loop Capital (10%),
Piper Jaffray (15%), BMO (15%) and Harvestons (5%).

BACKGROUND
The 2014 Summary Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer
early, substantive input into the development of the RTD 2015 Annual Budget. The purpose of the
attached calendar is to assist the Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the
development of the 2014 Amended Budget, 2015-2020 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and the 2015
Budget. The four General Manager strategic goals approved by the Board at the March 1 Board
Planning Session will be incorporated into the 2015 Budget plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the three financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the
Board to provide guidance and collaboration in:
(1) 2014 Amended Budget and proposed FasTracks multi-year project approval
(2) Determining the objectives of the 2015 Budget
(3) Understanding the key drivers of costs in the District’s annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to RTD programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing an understanding of departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for the
District to satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring

CONCLUSION
The suggested topics and timing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of
keeping the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the
Board to develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the
Board in moving ahead with this plan.

Subject:

Fiscal
Sustainability
Recommendations

Task

Force

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in November 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations, through a written report to the RTD Board of Directors, detailing opportunities for
operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal
sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members with 12 of those members being external to
RTD. The Task Force presented its recommendations to the Board of Directors in June 2011. The
Board of Directors subsequently approved those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue
implementation of each recommendation. The Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in July 2012
to be briefed on the progress of their recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The status
of those Task Force recommendations is as follows:
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in March 2011. Each quarter, Leeds provides a
forecast containing short-term (one year by quarter), medium-term (six year SBP period) and long-term
(30 year APE period) sales and use tax projections. This was implemented to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally. These forecasts are intended to provide a better analysis of RTD’s expected sales
and use tax collections which comprise approximately 2/3 of RTD’s recurring revenues.
Service Optimization
In 2012, RTD implemented modifications and reductions in service representing approximately $10.7
million or an 8% net reduction in service. Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and
implemented with Board approval in order to match services provided with available funding sources.
Since that time, some service has been gradually restored as needed within budgetary constraints.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. Fund balances
represent financial assets that are available to RTD after allowing for obligations that have been incurred.
Fund balances increase when fund sources exceed fund uses and vice versa. Fund balances therefore
exist as a form of savings account to be used for specific purposes when needed and replenished when
economic circumstances allow. In response to this recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance

Packet Pg. 62

2.C.3

policy with a target level of $90 million for the Base System, which is approximately three months of
operating expenses. This target was established based on levels recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA) best practices. The Fund Balance Policy further categorizes the
available fund balances into the categories of a Board Restricted Fund, a Capital Replacement Fund and
an Unrestricted Fund. At 12/31/13, unaudited fund balances for the Base System totaled $45.3 million,
consisting of the Board Restricted Fund of $16.2 million, the Capital Replacement Fund of $9.0 million,
and the Unrestricted Fund of $20.1 million.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
In Colorado, legislation establishes products and services that are subject to sales and use taxation and
those that are exempt from taxation. The state, cities, municipalities and special districts in Colorado
each have different sales and use tax rates and often have differing items subject to taxation due to
legislation establishing exemptions. RTD introduced legislation which was passed in May 2013 to
establish parity with the state regarding items subject to sales and use taxation. Exemption parity was
identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to RTD during difficult economic conditions when the
state implements exemption changes and vice versa. In addition, exemption parity removes the
complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the state. Exemption parity has taken
effect 1/1/14. RTD estimated that parity will generate a net increase of $2.7 million in 2014 based on
2012 figures. This will be difficult to track due to the way vendors report sales tax components.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted a comprehensive energy audit of the oldest and largest operating division (the Platte
facility) to determine the potential scope of savings that may be available through equipment and lighting
upgrades. The audit identified that facility lighting upgrades could result in potentially significant energy
savings. Areas for minor energy savings were identified for other building systems, however, these have
a very significant capital investment and long pay-back periods. Based on this information, RTD has
budgeted for energy upgrades throughout the District in the Strategic Budget Plan, and we will address
energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are completed. We have evaluated a variety
of solar applications which also require significant capital investment with a relatively long-term pay-back
period. RTD was successful in receiving a grant to install solar panels at East Metro and this project is
now complete. We have also completed a lighting upgrade at East Metro replacing older metal-halide
fixtures with energy efficient fluorescent fixtures. Lighting upgrades are also underway at other RTD
operating facilities. We hope to quantify cost savings in a few months.

Recommendations – Ongoing
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. Compliance reviews consist of RTD providing additional resources
from a contracted provider to supplement the DOR’s audit function. Due to the complexity of sales and
use tax filing requirements and tax boundaries in Colorado, this recommendation is intended to provide
the DOR with the additional resources necessary to ensure complete and timely tax compliance by
vendors. An Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and the DOR was completed and an RFP
was issued for compliance review services. RTD has contracted with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG)
who has substantial experience providing compliance review services to several Colorado municipalities.
Recent meetings have taken place with RTD, DOR and RRG to discuss the scope of work, procedures

Packet Pg. 63

2.C.3

contained in the IGA, identify audit candidates, and determine next steps. We expect the actual audit
program will be underway by March 31.
Naming Rights
The Board approved RTD securing the services of a corporate sponsorship and naming rights consultant,
and RTD entered into a contract with the internationally known firm IMG. IMG presented to the Board in
2013 an inventory and financial analysis of RTD facilities, services, and assets that may lend themselves
to naming/sponsorship value-added contracts. IMG has initiated the next phase of the contract and is
making recommendations for specific naming/sponsorship value-added contracts.
Any contract
opportunities will be presented to the Board for approval on a case-by-case basis.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. RTD has undertaken
some actions under this recommendation such as the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for
improvements to US36 and the East Line, as well as TOD activities. RTD continues to look for
partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.

Recommendations – Low Near-Term Priority
Recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized at the 2012 Board Retreat as having lower
near-term priority and their status are as follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges out-of-District patrons parking fees to use parking facilities as well as fees
charged to in-District patrons parking for longer than 24 hours. The Task Force identified charging
parking fees to all patrons as a possible revenue enhancement source. This recommendation could
be perceived as a fare increase. In 2013, the state legislation regarding RTD charging for parking
was amended to allow a third party to charge in-District patrons as long as RTD receives no revenue.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes. Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs. The agreement guarantees running
times, allows for bus on shoulder operations to facilitate schedule adherence on local service, and
provides for maintenance of managed lanes with no contribution from RTD. Prior to entering into
agreements with CDOT for managed lanes, RTD contributed to maintenance and snow removal on
the I-25 HOV lanes.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. RTD met several times with the DOR to discuss this initiative as well as sales and use
tax compliance reviews. Although the DOR did not object to RTD performing these services itself,
the Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. “Home Rule” is a state
constitutional authorization for creating municipalities. It could only be secured for RTD by statewide
constitutional amendment. As discussed earlier in this report, RTD has entered into an agreement
with DOR to facilitate better tax compliance and monitoring, which has been coupled with

Packet Pg. 64

2.C.3

simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items
taxed.

Fourth Quarter 2013 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter 2013. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District. Of the 22 performance measures tracked, RTD met 15 of the goals in their
entirety in the fourth quarter. The following are the exceptions to goals:
Goal 2.1 – The average number of facilities maintenance complaints per month remains above goal
at the end of 2014, however, the goal was met in Q4 and the measure has been on a declining trend
throughout 2013. Complaints are related primarily to paving and lighting issues, elevators and
shelters. Complaints were highest in Q1 due to issues about snow/ice and shelter clean-up from
snow and several instances where shelters have a one-time per week maintenance schedule. The
overall system growth is challenging our resources to consistently meet this goal.
Goal 3.1 – On-time performance data is being generated on-line and is more accurate due to the
implementation of the new CAD/AVL and APC systems. Staff continues to study individual route
and driver performance in order to focus on the worst-performing routes and staff is identifying the
resources needed to improve. The GM has asked to review current action steps and will consider
changes that may be necessary to improve performance.
Goal 3.3 – RTD as a whole fell slightly short of the 26,000 mileage between lost service road calls
due to shortfalls in the transit bus and articulated bus categories. This is due to the aging of the
fleet and deferral of fleet replacement. The number is improving as we expected it would because
the 2013-2014 fleet replacement cycle is underway.
Goal 4.2 – Although initial response to customer complaints was within goal, final resolution of
customer complaints slightly exceeded the goal by 0.9 business days, reflecting the impact of the
West Line and personnel staffing in various areas. The measure improved by 3.9 days from Q3 as
the issues reached resolution. It should be noted that this measure reports on resolution of customer
complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the number includes all departments
utilizing the Trapeze system for commendation and complaint research. We are investigating our
ability to report more meaningful data.
Regarding complaints per boardings, we have seen customer complaints increase across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, increasing ridership, and
heavy/longer load times. Top reasons continue to be “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and
“operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of

Packet Pg. 66

2.C.4

these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Complaints have reached
a static level. Staff has provided an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer
Service report.
Goal 6.3 – RTD did not meet its goal for EcoPass revenue in Q3. Revenue declined slightly in this
category due to continued migration from EcoPass to other fare media.
Goal 6.4 – RTD did not meet its goal for number of internal audits for 2013. The actual number was
down by 1 from goal of 20, which is attributed to a vacant Manager of Internal Audit position for 3
months in 2013. The new manager completed 6 of 7 audits remaining to be completed with the final
one in progress at the end of the year.
Goal 6.5 – RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in both bus mechanics and bus operators. We are
experiencing an unusually high level of vacancies in this category and recruitment efforts are
continuing. Vacancies are the result of retirements, system growth, and a strongly recovering local
economy.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or traffic or the errors of
pedestrians or other drivers.
2
It is not unusual for a greater number of accidents to occur during Q1 inclement weather. In addition, the majority of the
accidents were found to be non-preventable. First Transit-Commerce City continues implementation of DriveCam and Smart
Drive technologies to help operations improve driving practices.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.

The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing changes
in the downtown district which is affecting performance.
3
Due to the new CAD/AVL and APC systems, on-time performance data is being generated on-line and is more accurate. We
continue to focus on the worst routes and continue to identify the resources needed to improve. The GM will review the action
steps currently being taken and consider changes that may be necessary.

The measure reports on resolution of customer complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the number includes all
departments utilizing TrapezeCOM system for commendation and complaint research. The 2013 number reflects the impact of the West Line and
a vacant position earlier in the year.
3
Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL playbacks to
determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part
of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire system due to several factors including the fare
enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavier/longer load times; this higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and
is not increasing.

Subject:

January 2014 Financial Summary

BACKGROUND
Staff presents the monthly financial status report to the Board each month as an information item during
the Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting. Due to the year-end financial audit each
year, financial information for January is incomplete for timely presentation. For this reason, staff only
presents Dashboard information, including ridership, fare revenue and sales and use tax results for the
month.
DISCUSSION
Ridership, fare revenue and sales and use taxes for January 2014 were as follows:
