BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 6, 2014

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 5, 2014

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison services with
CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the third option year (January 1, 2015 through December 31,
2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $96,000. Funding for this contract is included in
the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the third option period from January 1, 2015, to
December 31, 2015. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the third option year ($96,000/year) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise the third option year

1.B.1

(January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of
$96,000.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to enter into
an agreement to exercise the third option year on the contract for the Local Government
Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested parties, and a new
Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not recommended because
CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local government matters
in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 6, 2014

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 5, 2014

Board Meeting Date: November 25, 2014

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into a new agreement for Federal Liaison Services with
Squire Patton Boggs LLP for a 23-month contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same
rate as currently being paid) with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two
at $270,000; option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s
internal cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014. The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new
contract for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and
has assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Government Relations Branch activities, status reports are issued
and special reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other
key Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and
respect from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD
has a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual
appropriations process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the
Congressional budget process. In addition, RTD is seeking a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension, which also entails extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts will be required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded
the annual appropriations in the current FFGA, as well as procuring the future FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expires on May 31, 2015, so the federal lobbyists will play a key
role in representing RTD’s needs in the next reauthorization bill. With the build out of FasTracks, the
lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new corridors, and
they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new reauthorization
language. When the bill is enacted, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to
the contents of the bill and monitoring the rule-making process.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs will provide guidance
and assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board
of Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a 23-month
contract at a cost of $494,500 ($21,500 per month—the same rate as currently being paid)
with three one-year options (option year one at $264,000; option year two at $270,000;
option year three at $276,000). The total amount of $1,304,500 was below staff’s internal
cost estimate, and funding for this contract is included in the annual budgets.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals have been reviewed and subjected
to the evaluation criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—
pursuant to RTD’s long-standing procurement procedures.
