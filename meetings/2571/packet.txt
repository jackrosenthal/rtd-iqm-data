Award of Access-a-Ride Service Contracts

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts with MV Transportation,
Transdev, and Via Mobility Services for the provision of Access-a-Ride service using dedicated vehicles.
These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years, for a 5-year cost of
$175,341,294.00. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be $20,715,915.00 for the total 5-year term. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for
Access-a-Ride dedicated-vehicle service and fuel is $196,057,209.00.
It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts with MV Transportation
and Transdev for the provision of Access-a-Ride service using non-dedicated (contractor provided)
vehicles. These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years, at a notto-exceed 5-year cost of $38,918,913.00. Fuel for the non-dedicated vehicle contracts is included in
the service contract price. These recommendations represent the most responsive and responsible
proposals received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-047 (dedicated vehicle) and 16DH-046 (non-dedicated vehicle) to provide Access-a-Ride Service. The contracts to provide this service
are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2017.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities which is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transportation Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center contractor, First Transit, one eligibility
certification contractor, Easter Seals of Colorado, three Service Provider contractors using RTD owned
vehicles and one Service Provider contractor using contractor-owned vehicles. The service providers
using RTD-owned “dedicated” vehicles are All Aboard Transit Services, MV Transportation, and Via
Mobility. The Service Provider using contractor-owned “non-dedicated” vehicles is Transdev. During
the course of the current contract, the service providers faced serious challenges in recruiting and
retaining operators. The Denver region is experiencing driver recruitment difficulties. Colorado has a
thriving economy and a very low unemployment rate, which means job applicants have many options.
The biggest challenge has been that many local organizations pay drivers higher rates than our current
service providers can afford. In addition to salary competition, the legalization of recreational marijuana
has introduced new challenges. Many otherwise qualified applicants and some employees are failing

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

their drug screening tests or choosing jobs where marijuana use doesn’t matter. As a result of these
significant factors, Access-a-Ride has been experiencing unprecedented challenges in meeting the needs
of our passengers. On a daily basis, staff struggles to have enough capacity to meet the ongoing
growth of the program. In order to mitigate current circumstances, staff elected not to extend the
option years (year four (4) and five (5)) in the current contracts and instead, issue new RFP’s in order to
offer proposers an opportunity to reevaluate current wages and to make adjustments accordingly.
On November 9, 2016, RTD issued two Requests for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price
proposals to provide Access-a-Ride services. One RFP gave proposers the option of bidding on 40% or
20% of the service using RTD-owned vehicles. The second RFP gave proposers the option of bidding on
5%, 10%, or 15% of Access-a-Ride service using contractor-owned vehicles. These services represent
the re-bid of service currently provided by All Aboard Transit Services, MV Transportation, Via Mobility,
and Transdev. The two RFPs were available on the RTD external website for public download. In
addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on December 15,
2016.

DISCUSSION
Five (5) proposals were received in response to RFP 16-DH-047 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride
services using RTD-owned “dedicated” vehicles. Proposals were received from All Aboard Transit
Services, MV Transportation, Total Transportation Corp, Transdev, and Via Mobility Services. In
addition, five (5) proposals were received in response to RFP 16-DH-046 for the provision of Access-aRide services using contractor-owned “non-dedicated” vehicles. Proposals were received from Metro
Taxi, MV Transportation, Transdev, Union Taxi, and Velocity.
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 16-DH-047, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride “dedicated-vehicle” service
provision to MV Transportation, Transdev and Via Mobility Services. This recommendation is based upon
the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this
procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach
and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key
positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d)
price (30%). In addition, it is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate
proposals received in response to RFP 16-DH-046, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride
“non-dedicated-vehicle” service provision to MV Transportation and Transdev. This recommendation is
based upon the same evaluation criteria as discussed above.
The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Larry Buter,
Manager, Paratransit Services; Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety
and Training Compliance Officer; Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor and Eric Castillo,
Quality Control Inspector.
Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative criteria set
forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for “Experience
and Proposed Key Positions.” SBE Submittal and Compliance was evaluated and scored by Amanda
Becker, SBO Compliance Officer. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by
the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of each proposal to determine the
overall score or rating of each proposal.

A comparison of the proposed costs was made using the lowest scores for the dedicated-vehicle 40%
and 20% and the non-dedicated vehicle 15%, 10%, and 5% service levels. The service model deemed
most advantageous to the District in terms of both quality and cost resulted in a combination of one
40% dedicated-vehicle provider (MV Transportation) two 20% dedicated vehicle providers (Transdev and
Via Mobility Services) and two 10% non-dedicated vehicle service providers (MV Transportation and
Transdev). It was the consensus of the evaluation team that these firms presented the best proposals in

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

terms of the understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed organization, approach
to deliver the requested service, attainment of SBE goals and proposed price.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firm’s proposals represent the most responsive and responsible proposals received in response to the
RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical and price
components consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP
document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
lower than the prices offered by the recommended service providers. The estimated cost was based on
projected wage rates and other operating expenses which were lower than those presented in each
proposal evaluated. As supported by the current labor market analyses that were included in the
dedicated-vehicle proposals, staff believes that the starting operator wages offered by each proposer will
give the contractors a much-needed ability to recruit and retain operators and thus address a major issue
facing all service providers in the Denver metro area. As discussed earlier, RTD as well as our
contractors have faced the same challenges with recruiting and retaining qualified operators. The
proposed starting wage will offer our providers the opportunity to make significant improvements which
will result in improved service for our passengers.
A portion of the funds needed for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are
included in the 2017 approved budget. However, due to the increased costs of the proposals, additional
funding may be requested during the Amended Budget process to ensure funding will be adequate to
provide Access-a-Ride service through the end of 2017. Funds will be requested in future budgets for
the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
2)

3)

Award contracts to MV Transportation, Transdev, and Via Mobility as recommended.
Maintain existing contracts by exercising options. This is not recommended as it does not
address the issues currently facing the Access-a-ride program. This would severely limit
the ability of RTD to provide Access-a-Ride service.
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and will provide a realistic wage for Access-a-Ride
operators to address current challenges in providing Access-a-Ride service.

Subject:

Access-a-Ride Travel Training Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services for
the provision of Travel Training services. Performance under the contract is for a one (1) year period
and shall not exceed $134,040.
BACKGROUND
As a former recipient of New Freedom Funds allocated to RTD for a variety of projects, the Bus
Operations Department, specifically, Contracted Services, endeavored to collaborate with an existing
contractor for the purpose of creating a Travel Training Program. The program, designed to travel train
individuals with disabilities, was to be a catalyst for motivating individuals to use fixed route services in
lieu of its paratransit counterpart, Access-a-Ride. The existing contractor selected was Via Mobility
Services. Via, an established paratransit provider and nationally recognized as a travel training pioneer
was asked to provide travel training services during an experimental phase in order to assess travel
training as a feasible service offered by the District.
Via focused their attention on any Access-a-Ride eligible passenger and sought the assistance from our
Eligibility provider, Easter Seals of Colorado, in order to identify travel training candidates during the
initial phase of the eligibility assessment process. The combined efforts resulted in a positive return and
Via was able to average 5-8 trainings per month. During 2016, the New Freedom Funds were no longer
made available to RTD, thereby necessitating the release of a new RFP for services. The duration of this
contract is for a one (1) year term. During this time, staff will work with the ADA Paratransit Advisory
Committee (APAC) as well as members of the DRMAC Transit and Accessibility Task Force (TATF) in
order to modify the approach of travel training. In the subsequent RFP for travel training, trainees will be
trained to use fixed route so that Access-a-Ride can incorporate fixed route when scheduling paratransit
service. As an example of how future trips can be scheduled, when applicable, Access-a-Ride can pick
up a passenger at their home, transport them to a Park-n-Ride where the individual will transfer to a
regular bus and at the tail end of that ride, Access-a-Ride will meet them in order to transport them to
their final destination.
Members of both APAC and DRMAC TATF have agreed to offer
recommendations for this new design and serve as test participants during the trial phase. The one-year
term of this recommended contract award will allow RTD staff time to fully analyze and develop the
Scope of Work for the modified travel training and will allow individuals to continue to received travel
training services through 2017.
DISCUSSION
On November 17, 2016, an RFP was issued by RTD and two responses were received in response to
the RFP for travel training services. The Proposers were First Transit and Via Mobility Services.
The first step in the evaluation process was to review each Proposer’s qualifications, which included
understanding/approach and organization for implementation, experience and qualifications, and cost.
The second step was a comparison of bids from those vendors deemed to meet the minimum

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.2

qualifications of the RFP. First Transit fell short of meeting expectations by not being able to identify
the local staff that would be responsible for the day to day operations or an operating facility.
Overall, both proposals were similar with regards to the scope of services. The total cost for year 1
from First Transit was $295,127.64 as compared to $134,040 from Via. Staff recommends
awarding the travel training contract to Via Mobility Services. The not-to-exceed contract cost for
one year is $134,040.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for 2017 are currently available in the adopted 2017 RTD budget.

May 2017 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
improvements, adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance a
number of services will have minor service reductions. The Route 40-Colorado Boulevard will see the
largest reduction during the peak period. The 41st-Fox and Pecos Junction Stations are proposed to open
to provide access to the B-Line and consequentially, Routes 8 and 19 are proposed to be realigned to
serve the new stations. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service
changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change
recommendations. The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Attachment A - May 2017 Service Change

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
With this proposal the current eastbound trip terminating at Lincoln/Alameda at 5:38pm, would
be extended to Centrepoint & Sable, arriving at 6:48pm, which extends 30 minute eastbound
peak frequency on East Alameda through the PM peak period. Current 2:42pm westbound trip
from Lincoln/Alameda, will instead originate at Centrepoint & Sable Transfer Center at 1:49pm.,
which extends 30 minute westbound peak frequency one hour earlier in PM peak.
It is also proposed to re-route westbound trips to serve Alameda Station northbound on
Cherokee Street instead of southbound. Westbound trips will access Alameda Station via
Bannock St, Virginia Avenue and Cherokee Street before continuing on Alameda Avenue.
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. (Current OTP: 83%
Weekday/67% Saturday/79% Sunday). Cost impact is estimated to be $121,800 annualized.
Route 4 - Morrison Road
It is proposed to re-route Route 4 to serve Alameda Station northbound on Cherokee Street
instead of southbound. Trips will access Alameda Station via Bannock St, Virginia Avenue, and
Cherokee Street before continuing on Alameda Avenue. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
This proposal reroutes the Route 8 to serve the 41st/Fox Station, as has been previously
approved by the RTD Board of Directors in the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan. Cost impact is
estimated to be $53,900 annualized.
Route 19 – North Pecos
This proposal reroutes Route 19 to serve the Pecos Junction Station, as has been previously
approved by the RTD Board of Directors in the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan. Cost impacts
are estimated to be $16,800.
Route 21 - Evans Avenue
It is proposed to move the 7:15pm trip leaving Federal Center Station 6 minutes later to leave at
7:21pm to provide a better connection from the W Line. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 37 – Smith Road Industrial
This proposal reroutes the Route 37 alignment via 33rd Place between Sable and Chambers
Road, instead of Moncrieff Place. Due to ADA accessibility issues, there are currently no bus
stops located on Moncrieff, where 33rd Place offers opportunities for the addition of bus stops.
No cost impact anticipated.

Bus

1.C.1.a

Route 40 – Colorado Blvd.
This proposal reduces weekday peak service frequency from every 10 to every 15 minutes.
Peak passenger loads and productivity no longer require the higher frequency, passengers can
be comfortably accommodated with a 15 minute frequency. Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be -$292,000 annualized.

Route 44 – 44th Avenue
Schedule adjustments are proposed due to new reroute near Clayton/43rd area, which were
initiated in January 2017. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 45 – Montbello via 51st/Green Valley Ranch
It is proposed to add PM peak bus for adequate recovery and on-time performance. Cost
impacts are estimated to be $78,000 annualized.
Route 55S – Olde Town Arvada/DUS
This service was implemented in December 2016, as an effort to provide access between the
Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and the University of Colorado A Line. Current ridership
performance on this service falls far short of the RTD Service Standard for fixed-route service.
The lowest ridership per hour standard for fixed-route service can be found in our Suburban
Local standard and is just over 7 passenger boardings per hour as a minimal threshold. The
best single day performance of this service saw 75 boardings, which equates to 6.25
passengers per hour for this route. The Route 55S, as designed, would fall under the service
standard for a Central Business District Local, which has a much higher standard of for minimal
ridership. The current average daily boardings for this service are 33.7 or 2.8 passengers per
hour, far short of the 17 passengers per hour minimal standard for a CBD Local service. Based
on its ridership performance, this service must be evaluated for discontinuance, if ridership does
not improve markedly. Current cost of the contract to provide this service is $2,000 per day or
$730,000 annualized.
Route 73 – Quebec Street
It is proposed to add a PM Peak vehicle to provide adequate operator recovery and schedule
reliability. Cost impacts are estimated to be $78,000 annualized
Route 105 – Havana
This proposal extends northbound evening service 30 minutes later, until 12:20am from
Ulster/Tufts. Current last northbound trip averages 25 passengers. Additionally, it is proposed
to discontinue 3:08am northbound trip, which carries 5 passengers at 7.6 boardings per hour.
Passengers may use alternative trips 30 minutes earlier or later. Net cost impact is estimated to
be -$13,700 annualized.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
The 3:07am northbound operating from Peoria/Albrook to 40th & Airport Station (2 passengers),
and 12:45am southbound trip operating from 40th & Airport to Peoria Station (2 passengers) are
proposed to be discontinued. Savings are estimated to be -$21,500 annualized.

Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
This proposal would extend evening service one hour later until approximately 12:00 midnight in
each direction. Current last trips average 20 boardings each, or 35 boardings per hour. Cost
impacts are estimated to be $35,000 annualized.

Route 153 – Chambers Road
It is proposed to discontinue 3:35am northbound trip from Sable/Colfax to Peoria Station, which
current averages 2 passengers. Savings are anticipated to be -$10,000 annualized
Route 157 – CCA/Buckley AFB
Due to low ridership it is proposed that evening service after 7:00pm be discontinued. Total
ridership is 16 passengers over 11 trips, or 1.4 passengers per trip and 6.4 passengers per
hour. Savings are anticipated to be - $48,000 annualized.
Route 205/205T – 28th Street/ Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Applewood Village Interlines
Route 28 - 28th Avenue
Route 32 - 32nd Avenue
Route 38 - 38th Avenue
Route 44 - 44th Avenue
Minor weekday schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA
It is proposed to add 2 AM peak and 2 PM peak trips to create a 30 minute frequency, as of
US36 & Table Mesa Station, in order to address current overloads and pass ups. These trips
are proposed to serve Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station, operate along Pearl Street,
28th Street, US36 to US36 & Table Mesa Station and then along the current AB route. The
introduction of the new Boulder Junction at Depot Square terminal would result in creating a
new pattern for the route and thus within the route would result in patterns AB1 (Downtown
Boulder Station) and AB2 (Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station) within current route AB.
This naming convention would mirror the naming convention of the current Flatiron Flyer
services (FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF5 and FF6) to streamline the naming conventions for regional
routes with multiple patterns, within the Boulder area. Cost impacts are estimated to be
$247,400 annualized.
Route AT – Arapahoe County/DIA
This proposal revises the schedule to provide a short recovery at DIA T-1 Roadway, with most
recovery to be taken at Arapahoe Station. This should resolve running time and recovery
issues in the current schedule by reducing travel to and from Ground Transportation Holding.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Attachment: Attachment A May 2017 Service Change (3030 : May 2017 Service Changes)

Route 135 – Smoky Hill Road
This proposal would add a 10:26pm eastbound trip from Nine Mile Station, which extends
evening service one hour later. Current last eastbound trip at 9:26pm averages 20 passengers
and 39 boardings per hour. Cost impacts are estimated to be $29,200 annualized.

1.C.1.a

Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont
This proposal Initiates previously Board approved BOLT Ltd trips via Boulder Junction at Depot
Square Station. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route L – Longmont/Denver
Running time and trip time adjustments due to interline changes with route BOLT/BOLT Ltd
BroncosRide
Recommendation is that BroncosRide service to the Olde Town Arvada and Ward Road Park-nRide be discontinued with the opening of the G Line. As with past rail openings, duplicate bus
service is proposed to be discontinued. Customers would instead use the G-Line to Denver
Union Station and transfer to the C, E or W Lines to the stadium. Current average game
boardings: Olde Town 264, Ward Road 275. Cost savings are expected to be -$97,484,
annualized.

Rail
B Line - Westminster/DUS
It is proposed to add stops at the 41st and Fox Station and the Pecos Junction Station to all trips. In
order to accommodate the additional stops, all trips will shift approximately 12 minutes earlier in the
northbound direction from Denver Union Station. Southbound trains would depart Westminster Station
at the same times and arrive Denver Union Station four minutes later than now. This change would
ensure that adequate layover time at both terminals is maintained and avoids conflicts at Pecos
Junction and on the single track segment.
It is proposed to add a later night northbound trip from DUS at 11:09 PM. This will provide a
better option for passengers attending evening events downtown. Cost impacts are contingent
upon a negotiated cost based on the Eagle P3 Concessionaire’s agreement.

Subject:

Cost Share Agreements Under $250,000

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required. This report provides information regarding cost share agreements that are within the
General Manager’s authority of $250,000.
BACKGROUND
These agreements are currently approved by the General Manager. This report has been generated for
informational purposes only.
DISCUSSION
Littleton Shopping Cart $30,861 for 2017. Since January 1992, the RTD has contributed to support

8,373; passengers per hour = 4.9.
Focus Points Family Resource Center (FPFRC) $53,240 for 2017. In January 2004, the RTD
discontinued the Route 47 and as an alternative the RTD entered into an agreement for a local non-profit
to provide a new community based service. FPFRC has long been an advocate and resource for
communities in Denver. FY2016 boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) = 1518; passengers per hour = 3.3.
Longmont Coordination of Services $12,000 for 2017. In January 2010, Via Mobility, a nonprofit
organization, applied for and received a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century New Freedom
grant to coordinate transportations services provided by Via Mobility and RTD in the city of Longmont.
Currently Via Mobility and RTD are now coordinating services between all Via and Call-n-Ride trips and
Access-a-Ride trips that can be operated on Via and Call-n-Ride services. Local matches of the grant will
be provided by Via Mobility, the City of Longmont and the RTD.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of these agreements were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. These
Agreements will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend these
Agreements.

Subject:

2016 Securement Area Issues Report

As you are aware, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Association (CCDC) entered into a joint
Settlement Agreement in March of 2014 in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the
securement area on board RTD buses for passengers who use mobility aids. One of the requirements of
the Settlement Agreement was for RTD to adopt a policy to ensure individuals who use mobility aids,
including wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the securement area. The key components
of this policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and non-disabled passengers must use the seats
behind the securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, non-disabled
passengers will not be allowed to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding at bus stops

Starting with the effective date of the policy (March 22, 2014), RTD has been tracking 1) each incident
in which a bus operator reported passing up a passenger using a mobility aid and 2) each incident in
which a passenger complained that an operator had violated the policy. In accordance with one of the
reporting requirements of the Settlement Agreement, RTD is to present a report summarizing the data
noted above on an annual basis to the Board of Directors and to the CCDC. The report is also shared
with the Denver Regional Mobility Access Council (DRMAC) for posting on the DRMAC website and it is
also posted on the RTD website. This report provides a summary of the securement area issues data for
the period of January through December of 2015.
The data collected for this report is generated in three ways – 1) the operator presses a pre-programmed
message button (“ADA PAX PASS-UP”) on the CAD/AVL radio system, 2) the operator makes radio
contact with RTD Dispatch using another button on the CAD/AVL radio system, or 3) a customer files a
report with the RTD Customer Care Division. Each incident generated by the above means is
investigated and tracked. The investigation includes a review of video from the bus (if available), a
review of the audio file documenting the conversation between the operator and the dispatcher, and a
report from the operator which includes a copy of the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” form given to the
passenger. Based on the results of the investigation, the securement area incident is assigned a code as
follows:
DUP

Duplicate – this indicates that the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button
multiple times for the same incident

NPI

Not a Pass Up Incident – this indicates that one of the following occurred
 The passenger was accommodated on this bus

Packet Pg. 24

1.C.3






The passenger boarded the following bus which was right behind this bus (no wait
time)
The passenger left the area
The operator pressed the button in error
The operator was asking a question about the policy or procedure

LIFT

Lift Inoperable – this indicates that the lift or ramp on the bus was not functioning as
required

2 W/C

2 Wheelchairs – this indicates that 2 passengers in wheelchairs were already occupying
the securement area

W/C+OMA

Wheelchair and Other Mobility Aid – this indicates that one passenger in a wheelchair and
a passenger using another mobility aid are already occupying the securement area

2 OMA

2 Other Mobility Aids – this indicates that 2 passengers using other mobility aids are
already occupying the securement area

PXO

Passenger Overload – this indicates the bus was standing room only and no one was
willing or able to move to make room

OTHER

These incidents include things like two passengers in wheelchairs want to travel together
but there is already one passenger in a wheelchair in the securement area or the flip seat
will not flip up

CSR

Customer Service Report – this indicates a report of a violation of the Policy was reported
to Customer Care

PENDING

This indicates the investigation into the incident is still in process

NO DATA

This indicates there was insufficient data available to verify that a passenger in a
wheelchair or other mobility aid was passed up

Other – several of these incidents indicate 2 passengers in wheelchairs wanted to ride
together and there was already one passenger in a wheelchair or with a mobility aid on the
bus
Investigation pending
No data available

One additional statistic that was tracked was the number of times an operator pressed the lower priority
“Request To Talk” (RTT) button in order to contact Dispatch regarding a passenger pass up instead of
the high priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button. During the reporting period of 1/1/16 through 12/31/16,
operators used the RTT button 174 times. For all of these incidents the operators were contacted and
reminded to use the higher priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button when reporting pass-up incidents.
The routes generating 20 or more pass-up incidents for the period of January through December, 2016,
were as follows:
Route 0 – 31 incidents (4.6% of total)
Route 3 – 21 incidents (3.2% of total)
Route 15 – 59 incidents (9.0% of total)
Route 15L – 28 incidents (4.3% of total)
Route 16 – 57 incidents (8.7% of total)
Route 31 – 26 incidents (3.9% of total)
Route 48 – 117 incidents (17.9% of total)
Route 52 – 71 incidents (10.9% of total)
RTD carries over 4.6 million passengers per month. The average number of operator-related complaints
received per month for both RTD and the private contractors through the 3rd quarter of 2016 was 1,875.
The total number of complaints received regarding a violation of the Settlement Agreement Policy for the
period of January through December 2016 was 39. The total number of complaints received regarding a
violation of the Settlement Agreement Policy for the period of January through December 2015 was 26.
For the period of March through December 2014 the number of complaints was 38. The primary
concerns raised in the complaints received regarding the Policy in 2016 were as follows:
 A non-disabled passenger raised the flip-up seats to make room for personal items
 A non-disabled passenger with a stroller was allowed to board without folding the stroller
 Operator did not board a disabled passenger prior to non-disabled passengers
 Operator did not let a disabled passenger using a stroller as a mobility aid board
 Route experienced frequent overloads with multiple passengers in wheelchairs or with other
mobility aids needing to board
For the period of March through December 2014, RTD operators reported 605 pass-up incidents, an
average of 60.5 per month. Of the 605 pass-up incidents, 474 (78%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of January through December 2015, RTD operators reported 858 pass-up incidents, an
average of 71.5 per month. Of the 858 pass-up incidents, 708 (83%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.

Packet Pg. 26

1.C.3

For the period of January through December 2016, RTD operators reported 652 pass-up incidents, an
average of 54 per month. Of the 652 pass-up incidents, 496 (76%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
RTD and the private contractors provide ADA refresher training for all operators each year. This training
continues to reinforce RTD policies and procedures regarding accommodating passengers with
disabilities on RTD buses. It also attempts to raise operators’ awareness of the needs of passengers
with a variety of disabilities and mobility challenges.
