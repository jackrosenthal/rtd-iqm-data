BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: January 7, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 5, 2016

Board Meeting Date: January 19, 2016

Subject:

April 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the April 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $301,100 and, further, to authorize the Interim General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. This
proposal is in concert with the implementation of the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and
Rail Service plan, already adopted by the Board in October 2015. The proposals herein include a mix of
service enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service reductions, which include the
discontinuance of seasonal school related service. We will monitor customer response to the
implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as
appropriate in future service change recommendations.
Also included in this document is a staff recommendation made in response to the City/County of
Denver request to redirect Free Mall Ride service off of the 16th Street and onto 15th Street and 17th
Street on numerous weekends during the summer of 2016 in order to accommodate “Meet in the
Street” (MITS) events as previously discussed with the RTD Board of Directors. The staff
recommendation can be found at the end or the discussion regarding the remainder of the proposed April
2016 service changes.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building and one meeting was held in
Lakewood. Comments received at these meetings and from the service change website are summarized
in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following list summarizes the proposed service
changes. Items highlighted in yellow represent substantive changes from the service changes initially
communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the April 2016 service change. A
summary of the staff recommendation regarding the requested 16th Street mall service reconfiguration
is also presented. Additional details are presented in Attachment A.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown: Grant funded, additional hours of service on weekdays and new
Sunday service
Broomfield Call-n-Ride: Grant funded, Call-n-Ride area expansion
Free Metro Ride: Grant funded, increase in peak frequency
Superior Call-n-Ride: Grant funded, new Call-n-Ride
Routes proposed for service reductions:
Belmar Call-n-Ride: discontinue service due to ridership performance
Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 16 – West Colfax: reroute trips terminating at 10th Broadway into the Civic Center Station.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA: Re-route via Northwest Parkway and E-470
Golden Call-n-Ride: Detour of services away from Colorado School of Mines Housing
Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287: Minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: Schedule adjustments
Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Discontinue seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1W, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 50, 52, 65, 73, 206/206F and 208/208F
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE
Change to summer schedules
Free Mall Ride: weekend service of the Free Mall Ride to be placed on an alternative path (15th Street
and 17th Street) for 5 consecutive weekends (Saturday and Sunday) starting on Saturday, June 25,
2016 and running through Sunday, July 24, 2016.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

The overall net financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $301,000 annualized.
Service increases are estimated to cost $503,600 annually, which includes $449,600 worth of grant
funded service improvements. Also included is an estimated $54,000 in cost to provide additional
service to maintain existing 16th Street Free Mall ride service frequencies during the10 days of Meet in
the Street events. Overall cost will be partially offset by a $202,500 base system savings due to the
cancellation of the Belmar Call-n-Ride.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed April 2016 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A LOOK AHEAD – Spring 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
B and G Lines Rail and Bus Service Plan (Northwest and Gold Line Corridors)

1.B.1.a

Attachment A
Route 16 – West Colfax
It is proposed to discontinue service to 10th & Broadway. Trips currently originating or
terminating at 10th & Broadway will instead originate or terminate at Civic Center Station.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
This proposal extends weekday hours of operation by 3 ½ hours. Service would be
provided between 5:30am to 8:00pm rather than the current 6am to 6pm. Additionally,
Sunday service is proposed to be added from 8:00am to 6:00pm matching current
Saturday service levels (hourly). This proposal is funded through a Transportation
Improvement Plan grant and sponsored by the City of Longmont. Cost impacts covered in
the grant are estimated to be $171,000 annualized.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT
Schedule adjustments are anticipated with no cost impacts.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA
Re-route via Northwest Parkway and E-470 (as described and adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors in the US 36 BRT Service Plan). No cost impacts are anticipated.
Free Metro Ride
Contingent upon the availability of bus operators, this proposal increases peak period
frequency to service every 4.5 minutes. This increase would be funded through a
Transportation Improvement grant awarded for 2016. Anticipated cost impacts are
estimated to be $52,000 annualized.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride has not met
the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The Call-n-Ride currently has one all
day bus, 5:30am – 8:00pm. It is recommended to discontinue the Belmar Call-n-Ride.
Cost Savings are estimated to be $202,566 annualized, including fuel.
Broomfield Call-n-Ride
The Broomfield Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2001. The Call-n-Ride operates out of
the Broomfield Park-n-Ride with scheduled meets. The Call-n-Ride boundary area is
approximately 136th Avenue on the north, Sheridan on the east, 112th Avenue/US 36 on
the south and Hwy 287 on the east. The Call-n-Ride operates 5:30am-7:00pm weekdays
only. The City of Broomfield applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement
Grant (CMAQ) for an additional vehicle for an expanded Call-n-Ride. The service area
would be expanded to approximately 144th Ave to the north and to Zuni on the east. All
expenses will be covered under the grant. The Call-n-Ride is planned for a start date in

1.B.1.a

Attachment A

Golden Call-n-Ride
Due to a construction project at US 6 and 19th Street for a minimum of 18 months, the
Call-n-Ride will not serve the School of Mines Student Housing and reroute the flex route
away from US 6 and 19th Street during the period of construction. The new routing will
utilize South Golden Road and Ford St, coming in on 19th Street from the east to serve the
campus. No additional costs are anticipated.
Superior Call-n-Ride
The City of Superior applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality
Improvement Grant (CMAQ) for a new Superior Call-n-Ride. The Call-n-Ride will operate
weekdays only 5:30am-7:00pm out of the US 36 & McCaslin Station with scheduled
meets. The Call-n-Ride boundary area will be approximately US 36 on the north, McCaslin
Blvd on the west, Interlocken Loop on the south and Interlocken Loop, including the
Flatiron Market Place on the east. The Call-n-Ride will operate 5:30am-7:00pm weekdays.
All expenses will be covered under the grant. The expanded Call-n-Ride is planned for a
start date in May 2016. Costs are estimated to be $113,266 annual costs, including fuel.
Grant will reimburse all costs.
Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Discontinue seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1W, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 50, 52, 65, 73, 206/206F and 208/208F

Change to summer schedules
Free Mall Ride
The 16th Street Mall opened in 1982, allowing RTD to intercept buses from the north at
Market street station (now DUS) and from the south at Civic Center Station. Through the
operation of the Free Mall Ride, RTD was able to remove 550 bus trips per day from the
Downtown Denver City streets. Currently the Free Mall Ride serves 22 bus routes at
Denver Union Station (DUS) and 30 bus routes at Civic Center Station (CCS), as well as 6
rail lines. The January 2016 service change added the Flatiron Flyer service to DUS and
and 4 Commuter Rail lines are anticipated to begin service to DUS during 2016. Numerous
local/limited bus routes traverse the Mall at various points along 16th making the Free Mall
Ride the “spine” of the Downtown network of transit services. With the advent of rail
operations the Free Mall Ridel continues to be our primary "first" and "last mile solution"
for transit riders accessing downtown Denver.
Ridership activity on the Free Mall Ride is the highest of any single bus route in the RTD.
The service averages approximately 45,000 boardings on a weekday, 25,000 on an
average Saturday and 18,000 on an average Sunday. This adds up to nearly 14 million
boardings per year or nearly 14% of RTD’s annual ridership. The overall average
passenger trip length is .5 (one-half) mile compared to a “rule of thumb” acceptable walk

May 2016. Costs are estimated to be $113,266 annualized, which includes fuel. Grant
will reimburse all costs.

1.B.1.a

Attachment A

The Free Mall Ride operates weekday from 5:00 AM - 2:00 AM; frequency ranges from 90
seconds to 15 minutes (generally from 90 seconds to 4 minutes). Saturday service is
operated from 5:30 AM- 1:30 AM; frequency ranges from 4 minutes to 15 minutes
(generally 4-6minutes). Sunday service operates from 6:00 AM- 1:30 AM; frequency
ranges from 4 minutes to 15 minutes (generally from 4-6 minutes).
The 16th Street Mall had a $76.1 million dollars construction cost, with 80% funding
through UMTA (predecessor to the FTA). The operating expense of the Free Mall Ride in
2013 (fully allocated) was $11.7M dollars. The service generated over 14 million
passenger boardings, resulting in a subsidy per passenger of $0.84, the lowest in the RTD
network. Annual maintenance cost of the 16th Street Mall is approximately $1 million per
year. It should be noted that RTD receives federal funding of approximately $8.9 M per
year in various forms of FTA funding (fixed guideway, Capital maintenance formula
funding etc.).
In cooperation with the City/County of Denver and the Downtown Denver Partnership,
weekend service of the Free Mall Ride is recommended to be placed on an alternative path
for 5 consecutive weekends beginning Saturday June 25, 2016 through Sunday, July 24,
2016. Alternative service would be provided on 15th and 17th Streets as was done during
select Sundays in the summer of 2015. Please see the City of Denver request in
Attachment C for further details describing the initial request. While the initial request from
the City of Denver proposed that alternative service be offered for 13 consecutive
weekends during the summer 2016 from June 4 through August 28, 2016, RTD staff is
recommending that the proposed service change be implemented for the 5 consecutive
weekends starting June 25, 2016 and running through July 24, 2016. Reducing the
number of weekends impacted by the Meet in the Streets project avoids impacting
mobility during a number of major Downtown special events scheduled next summer while
still providing to opportunity to test a variety of “Meet in the Street” configurations during
the summer. The estimated cost impact of this proposal is projected to be $54,000 to
fund the provision of additional Free Mall Ride service during the re-routes in order to
maintain existing service frequencies despite the additional travel time resulting from the
detour to 15th and 17th streets. Staff continues to be involved in conversation with
City/County of Denver staff regarding the source of funds for this additional service. Staff
does believe that the cost of the added service can potentially be reduced and treated as
part of the “demonstration” by only improving service on select weekend days and
comparing ridership impacts between existing service frequency and longer headways.
Additional financial impacts include the potential loss of FTA formula funding if ridership
losses on the Free Mall Ride service are not offset, either partially or completely, by
ridership increases for the system as a whole generated by folks travelling by transit to

distance to access transit of ¼ mile walk distance in urban or 1/3 mile walk distance in
suburban environments. It should be noted that like all RTD services, the Free Mall Ride is
wheelchair accessible, averaging over 200 wheelchair ramp events each weekday.

1.B.1.a

attend MITS activities. Staff estimates the maximum potential loss to be approximately
$200,000 per year based on Free Mall Ride ridership results from past MITS events. We
believe that RTD can generate at least some incremental ridership on the remander of the
system by promoting the use of the RTD system to access downtown to participate in
MITS events. The staff recommendation also allows for assessing the impact of additional
ridership generated at DUS due to the soon-to-be- introduced University of Colorado A Line
service which may also help offset some of the potential ridership loss of Free Mall Ride
ridership.

Request for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016

CC:
FROM:
DATE:
RE:

The City and County of Denver's Community Planning and Development in association with the Downtown Denver
Partnership and the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District are formally requesting RTD provide
alternative 16th Street Mall shuttle service during multiple Meet in the Streets (MITS) events during the summer
of 2016. The Meet in the Street events would occur Saturdays and Sundays from the weekend after Memorial Day
until the weekend prior to Labor Day. This would be 13 consecutive weekends starting Saturday June 4th, 2016 and
run weekly through Sunday August 28th, 2016. Alternative Mall shuttle service would be provided on 15th and 17th
Streets in place of 16th Street.
This request will further The Mall Experience Project, one of Mayor Hancock's three initiatives to Activate Denver's
Urban Core. The project, led by the City of Denver in partnership with the Downtown Denver Partnership, aims to
guide improvements to the 16th Street Mall that will make it a better place for people. To achieve that, and with
the help of consultants Gehl Architects, we will be studying Mall activity and conducting public outreach to identify
ways to help the Mall reach its full potential as a welcoming place in the heart of our downtown. The 2016 MITS
events are one of several short-term recommendations made by Gehl in the report entitled "Downtown Denver
161h St Mall: Small Steps Towards Big Change" (draft report attached).
Key elements of MITS 2016 request:
•
Builds upon previous MITS events organized by the Downtown Denver Partnership in 2014 (2 events) and
2015 (5 events) that used the same alternative mall shuttle service.
•

Maximizes outreach, programming, and predictability for all users by occurring on a regular basis each
Saturday and Sunday during summer months.

•

Allows survey work during all MITS events, each with varying levels of activation in a more regular
occurring timeframe. In this case, "survey" means observation, pedestrian counts and man-on-the-street

•

Coordinates with CCD departments, DDP, and RTD to observe and measure the impact of MITS on the
multimodal experience on and in the vicinity of the 16th Street.

•

Fosters the strengthening of relationships with key downtown stakeholders that contribute to 161h Street
Mall being a world-class destination- a premier public space for people and an authentic Denver
experience. Potential stakeholder partnerships include Visit Denver, Colorado Rockies, Denver Art

intercept surveys.

Museum, etc.
We will work closely with RTD with all necessary communication, wayfinding, and outreach efforts regarding the
alternative mall shuttle service and other transit options before and during MITS 2016.

To the RTD Board of Directors:
I’m writing today seeking your support for the City and County of Denver’s request for alternate mall

greatly help to further The Mall Experience study, an effort to elevate the experience people have in

Re: Request for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016
Dear Mr. Genova,
The Downtown Denver Pa1tnership (the Paitnership) is writing this letter in
support of the City and County of Denver's (City) formal request to the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) to provide alternative 16th Street Mall
shuttle service during Meet in the Street (MITS) events on Saturdays and
Sundays during the summer of2016. The alternative shuttle service would be
provided on l 51h Street and 17th Street.
The Partnership and the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District
(BID) have worked closely with the City, RTD and many other stakeholders in
holding two MITS events on nonconsecutive Sundays in July and August, 2014,
and five MITS events on nonconsecutive Sundays in June, July and August
2015. Funding for these events was provided for by the BID, and managed
closely by Paitnership staff. RTD provided the alternative shuttle service
requested above on all of those occasions. All of these events were well­
attended and extremely well-received by the public, and served to enhance the
vitality and sense ofsafety on the l 61h Street Mall. Of equal importance, from
our observations and feedback we received, the alternative service met the needs
of Downtown transit users very effectively - we received many positive
responses about the events and are unaware of any complaints about transit
service levels during these events from any of our constituents or anyone in the
general public.
The repeated success ofMITS over the last two years has encouraged us to look
at expanding MITS activities to the 13 weekends mentioned above. It is our
belief that conducting MITS on both days, and on consecutive weekends, will:
•

allow us to maximize our coordination, outreach and communications
about these events,

give all interested parties and the general public greater predictability
and consistency regarding access to Downtown during these weekends,

•

maximize our ability to study the effects and changes generated by
holding MITS events in a sequential fashion, and

•

continue to strengthen the excellent working relationships already in
place between RTD, the Partnership, the BID and the City.

We have spoken to a wide variety of our members, BID property owners and
downtown hotel representatives (including the Sheraton Denver, the Hyatt
Regency Convention Center and the City Center Marriott) about this request,
and have received overwhelming and very positive support.
We will continue to work closely with RTD, the City and all of our other
Downtown partners and stakeholders regarding the necessary logistics,
communications, outreach and planning necessary to make MITS a success
again in 2016.

Re: Support for alternative Mall shuttle service during Meet in the Street 2016
Dear Mr. Genova,
VISIT DENVER, The Convention and Visitors Bureau, submits this letter in support of the City and County of Denver’s
request to the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to provide alternative 16th Street Mall shuttle service during Meet
in the Street (MITS) events on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays during Summer 2016.
The 16th Street Mall is Denver’s #1 tourist attraction. However, increasing security and safety concerns along the Mall
require new, innovative approaches to ensure this corridor is the city’s crown jewel. As has been demonstrated during
previous MITS, these events have been well-attended and well-received by the public, and served to enhance the vitality
and sense of safety on the Mall. To enable these successful events in 2016, we support alternative shuttle service
provided along 15th and 17th Streets, as was done previously, to effectively and conveniently transport residents and
visitors through the downtown core.
VISIT DENVER believes continuing MITS in Summer 2016 on consecutive weekends will:




benefit conventioneers and leisure visitors by making the Mall a weekend family-friendly safe destination and
gathering space to be enjoyed in a very different way from the way the Mall functions during the week
maximize coordination, outreach and communications efforts about these events to residents and visitors alike
by giving all interested parties and the general public greater predictability and consistency regarding access to
downtown during these weekends
better study the impacts generated by holding MITS events in a sequential fashion

VISIT DENVER is committed to continuing its collaboration between RTD, the City, Downtown Denver Partnership, and
other key stakeholders in assuring that all logistical details -including communicating these changes to visitors and
coordinating with other major events - will be addressed.
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Genova,
Thank you for the invaluable service you provide to the citizens of Colorado.
On behalf of the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, I would like to express our support of the City
and the Downtown Denver Partnership's request for alternative shuttle service on 15th Street and
17th Street during their Meet in the Street (MITS) events proposed for summer 2016.
Many of our fans choose to use RTD transportation to and from our home games. Not only does
it help fans get to the ballpark, but it also serves as an asset to the City, as the 16th Street Mall
then becomes a pre-game and post-game destination. One of the main advantages for Rockies
fans that use the RTD lines into Downtown Denver has been the shuttle service that significantly
reduces the number of blocks they have to walk to reach the ballpark. Should that not be
available, it will encourage them to look for alternative transportation instead of utilizing the
RTD. We believe that the proposed alternative shuttle service will be a viable option for Rockies
fans on MITS event days, and therefore changing the service location on the dates of the MITS
would benefit all concerned parties and the community as a whole.
Ifyou have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at 303.312.2262.

Date: January 7, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 5, 2016

Board Meeting Date: January 19, 2016

Subject:

Purchase of up to 46 - 45' Heavy Duty
Intercity Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 12FK002 with
Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 46 - 45-foot heavy duty intercity buses and
associated spare components at a price not to exceed $27,500,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance 1900 Series MCI intercity buses and 2800 Series Neoplan intercity
buses.
The RTD Board of Directors approved the purchase of 48 MCI intercity buses on May 22, 2012 and six
(6) additional MCI buses on November 27, 2012 as replacements for the 1998 model year 1900 Series
MCI buses.
The procurement was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) advertised on January 27, 2012.
Proposals were received on April 20, 2012, and MCI was determined the most responsive and
responsible proposer. The RFP allowed RTD to purchase additional MCI intercity buses for a five year
period with each successive year pricing being based on the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment
set by the US Department of Labor Producer Price Index (PPI).
On January 21, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 59
buses to replace 42 – Neoplan buses and to add 17 expansion buses for the US 36 BRT service.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to MCI to exercise the purchase
option for a quantity of up to 46 additional intercity buses. Forty-three (43) new buses are for the
replacement of the remaining 43 – 2800 Series Neoplan buses, and 3 buses are for the support of
service expansion.

DISCUSSION
RTD currently operates 43 buses of the 2001 Model Year 2800 Series Neoplan subfleet. These buses
have exceeded their Federal Transit Administration (FTA) service life of 12 years or 500,000 miles. The
buses are approaching 15 years in age and have accumulated, on the average, over 723,000 miles of
service each. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer,
Neoplan Corporation, went out of business several years ago. Replacement parts are difficult to obtain,
and many of the parts are simply no longer available. The requested new buses will replace the 43

Packet Pg. 24

1.B.2

remaining and soon-to-be obsolete Neoplan buses and 3 additional buses will be acquired to supplement
the existing fleet to meet increased service demand.
The MCI buses will be 45' long and have 57 passenger seats. The buses will be equipped with a
wheelchair lift and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. The clean diesel engines
will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the
existing buses. The buses will be equipped with the automatic passenger counting (APC) system and
the security digital camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to MCI to exercise the purchase option for a
quantity of up to 46 - 45’ intercity buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$27,500,000. The funding for this contract amendment is approved and available in the District’s 2016
Adopted Budget.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, MCI has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
To authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract
12FK002 with Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 46 - 45-foot heavy duty
intercity buses and associated spare components at a price not to exceed $27,500,000. This is
the recommended alternative.
2.

Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not recommended as it
would result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost
to the project.

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 40 40' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $17,677,000 for the purchase of 40 additional 40’
transit buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a quantity of 40 additional 40’ transit buses. Thirty (30) new buses are for the replacement of
the remaining 30 – 2000 Series Orion buses, and 10 buses are for the support of service expansion.
The remaining 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are now 16 years old and have accumulated on average 670,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer, Orion Bus
Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts required for the repair of the buses
are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the replacement of the
Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014 and 64 buses in
2015. Due to the increased service demand, RTD has kept 30 Orion buses in continued service. The
replacements for these buses and the 10 expansion buses have been approved in the adopted SBP.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary
price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 110
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
On February 17, 2015 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 64
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 26

1.B.3

The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger
count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as walker, child stroller and
shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
quantity of 40-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$17,677,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2016 Adopted
Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Gillig for the purchase of
40-40’ transit buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Contract Award for the Purchase of Up to 241
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to award a contract to Master’s Transportation
for the purchase of up to 241 Goshen cutaway buses for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services at a
price not to exceed $14,580,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Cutaway Buses, Model Years from 2005 to 2011, currently being used
for the Access-a-Ride service.
RTD issued an Information for Bids (IFB) on October 19, 2015. Five bids were received on December 8,
2015. Master’s Transportation was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus
configuration. The IFB allowed RTD to purchase cutaway buses for a five year period with each
successive year pricing being based on the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment set by the US
Department of Labor Producer Price Index (PPI).
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract to Master’s Transportation for the purchase of up
to 241 Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace the 2005 to 2011 Model Years Goshen and
Startrans buses used for the Access-a-Ride service and 14 buses (10 AAR’s and 4 CNR’s) will be
acquired to supplement the existing Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride bus fleets for service expansion.

DISCUSSION
RTD’s Access-a-Ride Service currently operates 227 Goshen and Startrans cutaway buses of the Model
Years 2005 to 2011. These buses have exceeded their Federal Transit Administration (FTA) service life
of 5 years or 150,000 miles. The buses to be replaced are 5 to 10 years in age and have accumulated
between 118,000 and 355,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The new Goshen cutaway buses will be up to 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an extended
sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the Calln-Ride buses and three wheelchair access areas for the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA
compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security camera system per the current standard on
all new RTD buses.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the
University of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for
calendar year 2016 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,410,771.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,410,771.00 in 2016.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of
Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision
of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.9 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy
per HOP passenger trip of $1.66. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route service in
2014 ranged from an average of 34.7 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an average of 18.3
boardings per hour for suburban local service.

Packet Pg. 30

1.B.5

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2016 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service
so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

DRCOG Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is
for calendar year 2016 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $947,600.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be fiscally sustainable and to render regular,
on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the
costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 32

1.B.6

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 115 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.4 riders per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2015 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per
passenger seat used of approximately $3.79 and $2.47 for each seat sold. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.30 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.78 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $4.75 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2016 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting and increased demand for low productivity
transit service as an alternative.

Englewood Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation
of the art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2016 and
is for an amount not to exceed $301,189.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the
management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related
expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood.
The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged
a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 648.0 boardings per day or 26.9 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $301,189 in 2016
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 26.9 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.27. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route suburban service in 2014 was 18.3 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $6.78 per boarding.
The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2016 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.

5311 Cost Share Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2016 and for amounts
not to exceed $364,933.00 for Boulder County, $358,849.00 for Adams County and $111,187.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Since
1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of
transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal
grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $364,933.00 in 2016. RTD shall also
contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams
County in amount not to exceed $358,849.00 in 2016.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $111,187.00.00 in 2016.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service in 2015 resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.39 to approximately
$2.48 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.5 passengers per hour in 2014 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at

Packet Pg. 36

1.B.8

approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $16.93 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average of 1.2 boarding per hour and a
subsidy per passenger trip of approximately $57.30 in 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2016 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Service Increase for Transdev On Demand

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the Transdev On Demand ADA paratransit
services contract #13-DH-035 to increase the level of Access-a-Ride services per month at a reduced
per-trip cost ($36.50 for contract year 2 and $37.23 for contract year 3) to be effective 2/1/16
through 12/31/16. This represents an increase of $460,000 in the overall contract costs. This
action also approves the transfer of funds necessary to fund this increase in contract cost.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, All Aboard Transit Services, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev On Demand, to provide Access-a-Ride
paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of the service providers (All Aboard, MV,
and Via) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide the service. The fourth provider (Transdev On Demand)
uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide the service. The current Access-a-Ride
contracts were implemented in April of 2014 following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The current
Access-a-Ride service model is a change from the previous service model. Previously, the service
had been provided by four (4) providers all using RTD-provided vehicles.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the three dedicatedvehicle service providers (All Aboard, MV and Via) were all planning to hire a portion of the operators
that were at the time employed by Global Transportation because Global Transportation was not
awarded a new Access-a-Ride service contract. Due to a variety of reasons, a large number of
former Global operators decided to find employment elsewhere. Given the extremely tight labor
market in the Denver area, the three dedicated vehicle providers struggled to meet the demand for
service. Despite their aggressive hiring campaigns, all of the providers continue to be challenged to
find sufficient numbers of operators. The legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado has
added to the challenge, and the ever increasing pattern of traffic congestion has increased demand
for more vehicles and forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center to assign more and more service to
Transdev. Surprisingly, the forces working against the dedicated vehicle providers have not have an
equal impact on the cab industry.
The reliance on Transdev to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that the dedicated vehicle service
providers have been unable to provide, has resulted in an increase in the number of trips provided by
Transdev On Demand in 2015. The dedicated-vehicle service providers continue to experience
difficulties hiring qualified drivers. Consequently, it will be necessary to continue expanding the
service provided by Transdev On Demand through 2016 so that RTD will be able to meet the needs
of our ADA paratransit eligible customers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:

Packet Pg. 38

1.B.9

There is no financial impact. The increased Transdev On Demand contract costs will be offset by a
decrease in service levels on other existing ADA paratransit services contracts. There 2016
approved budget includes funding for Via, MV, and All Aboard Transit service budgets that will be
transferred into the Transdev On Demand service budget to cover these costs.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that Transdev On Demand can provide additional
Access-a-Ride service thereby improving our ability to provide on-time and reliable service to our
passengers.
2)
Do not approve the recommended action. This course of action is not recommended as it will
diminish our ability to provide appropriate service to our passengers.

Cost Share Agreements Under $250,000

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required. This report provides information regarding cost share agreements that are within the
General Manager’s authority of $250,000.
BACKGROUND
These agreements are currently approved by the General Manager. This report has been generated for
informational purposes only.
DISCUSSION
Littleton Shopping Cart $30,256 for 2016. Since January 1992, the RTD has contributed to support
the Littleton Shopping Cart which was implemented to serve portions of certain routes previously served
by RTD. The Shopping Cart is a free service provided by the City of Littleton for area residents.
FY2015 (thru 3rd Qtr) boardings = 8,628; passengers per hour = 5.6.
Focus Points Family Resource Center (FPFRC) $52,196 for 2016. In January 2004, the RTD
discontinued the Route 47 and as an alternative the RTD entered into an agreement for a local non-profit
agency to provide a new community based service. FPFRC has long been an advocate and resource for
communities in Denver. FY2015 boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) = 2361; passengers per hour = 5.4.
Longmont Coordination of Services $16,500 for 2016. In January 2010, Via Mobility, a nonprofit
organization, applied for and received a Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century New Freedom
grant to coordinate transportations services provided by Via Mobility and RTD in the city of Longmont.
Currently Via Mobility and RTD are now coordinating services between all Via and Call-n-Ride trips and
Access-a-Ride trips that can be operated on Via and Call-n-Ride services. Local matches of the grant will
be provided by Via Mobility, the City of Longmont and the RTD.
Ride Provide A Line $189,093 for 2016. In February of 2003, the RTD Board of Directors approved the
discontinuation of service on the skyRide Route AS beyond the Stapleton Transfer Station due to low
ridership at the Olde Town Arvada and Ward Road Park-n-Rides. As a result of this action, interested
parties in the City of Arvada developed a business plan to implement scheduled shuttle van service to be
operated directly between the Olde Town Arvada park-n-ride and Denver International Airport (DIA). The
proposed business plan called for the provision of scheduled shuttle van service, the A-Line, to be
operated between Arvada and DIA. This service was implemented May 11, 2003 to coincide with the
elimination of AS SkyRide service to Arvada. This service will cease operation with the opening of the
Gold Line (G-Line) planned for the fall of 2016. FY2015 boardings (thru 3rd Qtr) = 39313, passengers
per hour = 4.6.
