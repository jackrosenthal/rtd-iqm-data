### B. Recommended Actions

Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Board that most of the recommended actions on the agenda were housekeeping items.  She noted that State Law dictates that contracts cannot go on indefinitely.  Most of the actions this evening are renewals of contracts that are already in place.  She hopes that the Board can get through the agenda in an efficient manner.

#### 1. April 2016 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the April 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $290,966, and a net annualized cost of approximately $65,000 after grant funding; further, the Board of Directors authorizes the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 19, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that this is the one action he would not classify as housekeeping.  He reminded the Board that normally these service changes would be implemented in May, but they had been moved forward to coincide with the University of Colorado A Line opening.  He noted that the service plan for the University of Colorado A Line was approved in October and these service plan changes are very minor in comparison.  He asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, to review the recommendations.

Jessie Carter shared that three public meetings were held in December with only three participants.  He explained that is largely due to the changes being very benign.  He stated that the most notable changes are on the 16th Street Mall Shuttle for the Meet in the Streets events, the increase in peak period frequency for the Free Metro Ride, a new grant funded Call-n-Ride in Superior and the cancellation of the Belmar Call-n-Ride.

Bruce Abel informed the Board that staff has worked with the City and County of Denver (City) and the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) to investigate various scenarios for the Meet in the Streets events over the summer.  Initially the City and DDP requested the 16th Street Mall Shuttle be moved to 15th and 17th Streets for 13 consecutive weekends.  After ongoing conversations, RTD staff is recommending 5 consecutive weekends between Saturday June 25 and Sunday July 24.

Bruce Abel said that during the Meet in the Streets events, staff wants to work with the City and DDP to evaluate ridership not just on the Mall Shuttle, but throughout the entire system.  The Market Research Department will be working to assess the pre, during and post reactions from our customers.  He stated that the City, DDP and RTD also want to look at changes in business along the Mall in terms of sales volume as well as other qualitative measures.  He believes removing the Mall Shuttles from 16th Street for five consecutive weekends provides the opportunity for meaningful analysis.

Bruce Abel acknowledged Brad Buchanan, Bar Chadwick, David Gaspers and Jason Whitlock from the City and County of Denver and John Desmond from the Downtown Denver Partnership, who were all in attendance this evening.

Director Solano called for the question and Director Folska seconded the question.  Committee Chair Anderson asked for a voice vote on the motion to call the question.  The motion failed with no one in favor.

Director Lubow asked how much it would cost RTD to move the Mall Shuttles to 15th and 17th Streets.  Bruce Abel explained that there are two components that make up the cost to RTD.  The first cost is related to maintaining the service frequency levels that RTD runs currently along the 16th Street Mall.  Since running on 15th and 17th has a longer travel time, additional buses would need to be added to maintain the frequency.  He said staff projects the additional buses to cost $54K for the 5 weekends.  He said that staff is in talks with the City about funding the additional buses.  Bruce Abel stated that in addition to needing more buses, staff also anticipates a potential loss of FTA formula funding if ridership loses on the Mall Rider are not offset by ridership increases elsewhere in the system.  Staff estimates the maximum potential loss to RTD to be approximately $200K based on information from last year’s Meet in the Streets events.

Director Lubow wondered if staff was talking to the City about just helping RTD with the cost of the additional buses or if staff had asked the City to help offset any funding RTD might lose from the FTA formula funding.  Bruce Abel stated that the conversations were not relative to revenue lost but the funding of increased service.  Director Lubow hopes staff will think about speaking with the City about both funding issues.

Director Bagley expressed his support of staff’s recommendation related to the 16th Street Mall; however, he believes there still needs to be ongoing analysis about issues surrounding the Meet in the Streets events.  There are many issues to consider such as safety and security, marijuana use around the 16th Street Mall, urban camping, homelessness, etc.  He said the design of the mall transit way also needs to be explored as some portions have a center island section and other portions do not.  He hopes the Board can get additional information from this summer’s Meet in the Streets events as he does not feel what was provided previously was sufficient.

Director James thanked all those in attendance from the City and DDP.  He believes this is illustrative of the strong partnership that has been created.  He agrees that the issues raised by Director Bagley are very important ones.  He knows the City and DDP are addressing them with studies that are being done right now.  He thanked staff for being collaborative with the City and DDP as well.  He recognized that they wanted more than RTD could give but he thinks we have hit the sweet spot.  He believes the 16th Street Mall has the potential to extend what was done at Denver Union Station.

Director Solano thinks the demand for security during the Meet in the Streets events is going to be high and expressed a concern about the cost of that added security.  Bruce Abel explained that additional security would be provided by the City and DDP for any Meet in the Streets event so there would be no additional security costs for RTD.

Director Hoy asked for clarification as to how much the City would be paying RTD for moving our service off the 16th Street Mall.  He wanted confirmation that the action this evening was to approve moving the Mall Shuttle to 15th and 17th Streets without any payment from the City at this time.  Bruce Abel stated that was correct.  He reiterated that staff has opened the dialog with the City to see if they had the budget to help us increase the frequency on some of the weekends along 15th and 17th Streets.

Director Sisk shared his support for staff’s recommendation in response to the City and DDP’s request for the Meet in the Streets events.  He said he was more concerned with the Flatiron Flyer 4.  He recognized that staff is currently working on some of the issues but said he would be voting no today to ensure the dialog stayed open.

Director Bagley asked staff to provide the Board with the results of the surveys that were conducted during the previous Meet in the Streets events prior to the Board meeting.  He also asked that the Board be provided the survey results for the upcoming Meet in the Streets events as quickly as possible over the summer.

Director Menten stated that she would be voting no.  She does not feel it makes sense to expand service, as is done in most cases in the April Service Changes, when there is already a driver shortage.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion FAILED.

Committee Chair Anderson asked if there was anyone who voted no that would make a motion to reconsider staff’s recommendation for the April 2016 Service Changes.

#### 9. DRCOG Cost Share Agreement

This agreement is for calendar year 2016 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $947,600.00.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 19, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Menten inquired if taxpayers were putting out capital to create vanpools.  Bruce Abel stated that RTD has provided funding to DRCOG to support the Way to Go vanpool program since 2001.  He explained that prior to RTD’s support, the vanpool had very limited participation.  The issues that were presented to RTD were an inability to find drivers because 15 passenger vans were awkward and the cost structure was challenging.  RTD made the decision to provide subsidy funding to allow a customer to pay approximately the cost of a monthly bus pass while still allowing DRCOG to have enough funding to run the vanpool on a financially sustainable basis.  He said that RTD’s funds are used to help offset the cost of insurance, fuel, capital, etc.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 10. Englewood Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 19, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              There were no questions or discussion on this item.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 11. 5311 Cost Share Agreements

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County.  These Agreements are for calendar year 2016 and for amounts not to exceed $364,933.00 for Boulder County, $358,849.00 for Adams County and $111,187.00 for Jefferson County.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 19, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Solano asked how the amount of money each county received was determined.  Bruce Abel explained that 5311 is a program where federal funds are given to communities to support transportation in non-urbanized areas.  Those funding amounts are based on things like population density, area size, etc.  He said that those counties used to receive the grants directly from the Federal Government but when they became part of the RTD District, RTD began to receive the money.  RTD is simply passing back to each county the funding they received when they were the direct recipients.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 12. Service Increase for Transdev On Demand

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the Transdev On Demand ADA paratransit services contract #13-DH-035 to increase the level of Access-a-Ride services per month at a reduced per-trip cost ($36.50 for contract year 2 and $37.23 for contract year 3) to be effective 2/1/16 through 12/31/16.  This represents an increase of $460,000 in the overall contract costs.  This action also approves the transfer of funds necessary to fund this increase in contract cost.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 19, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Menten asked what staff meant in the Board Report when it indicated that the forces working against the dedicated vehicle providers have not had an equal impact on the cab industry.  Bruce Abel explained that meant that the challenges faced by RTD in hiring drivers have not been experienced by the Taxi industry.  He said that services like Uber and Lyft have led to Taxi drivers looking for other ways to expand their revenue stream, meaning they are now available for RTD to hire.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Cost Share Agreements Under $250,000

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that there are a number of agreements that fall within the Interim General Manager’s authority that are entered into annually.  He explained that staff wants to make sure the Board is aware of the agreements.  He said that the list of agreements was included in the January 12, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

There were no questions or discussion on this item.

#### 2. Greyhound Update (no back-up)

Bruce Abel shared with the Board that staff had received a request from Greyhound to work with RTD to utilize Denver Union Station more in their operations.  He said there is a great deal of analysis that must be done but staff wanted to keep the Board informed that a request had been made.  He indicated that staff would keep the board appraised throughout the process.

Director Menten asked if Greyhound was supported wholly by its customers or if it was subsidized in any way.  Bruce Abel stated that Greyhound is a private, for-profit corporation.  He knows there are federal programs to get companies like Greyhound to run routes that would not otherwise be profitable but he does not know if Greyhound participates in any of those programs.

### D. Other Matters

Director Sisk thanked everyone for their hard work and participation in the opening of the Flatiron Flyer.  He said the Ribbon Cuttings and VIP Reception were really outstanding events.  He commended the Marketing department for their efforts.  He stated that the work was not done yet as there was always tweaking with new service but he is confident in what the staff will do.

Committee Chair Anderson thanked Director Sisk for his service as Chair for the last two years.  She thought he did a commendable job.

Director James thanked Director Sisk for his service as Chair and for initiating the motion to reconsider the April 2016 Service Changes.  He believes this is an opportunity for RTD to partner with the heart of the Metro area.

Bruce Abel noted that in general the launch of the Flatiron Flyer went well; however, there have been some challenges, especially on the Flatiron Flyer 4.  He said he would characterize the challenges as the type of problem we would like to have, which is too many people wanting to ride our service.  He shared that beginning tomorrow two p.m. return trips would be added in an attempt to address the overcrowding.  He stated that staff would continue to monitor the service to address any issues.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 7:28 p.m.
