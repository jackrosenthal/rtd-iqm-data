RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1 and 7, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement states that on an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Mid-term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs. Capital Improvement Policy 7 states that RTD will prepare an annual update of the
FasTracks plan which will be integrated with the Base System plan into the Mid-term Financial Plan
incorporating actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement
costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating
programs.
The Mid-term Financial Plan is a six-year financial plan consisting of the Base System and FasTracks.
The Base System MTFP includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales/use
tax, and FasTracks operations activity. The FasTracks MTFP includes expense and projects (nonoperational) funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales/use tax.
Updated annually, the Mid-term Financial Plan provides important cash flow planning information used to
determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as services that the District
can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the Mid-term Financial Plan serves as
the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Per RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (annual budget), medium term (Mid-term
Financial Plan) and long term (Financial Plan). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds
School of Business for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement, Transit Asset Management Plan
and State of Good Repair priorities. Projects are constrained to operate within the forecast of revenues
and funding sources available for their completion and operation.
The Mid-term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council
of Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the MTFP qualifying projects are included
in the TIP.
Projected Base and FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2026-2040 are presented
separately in the Long-Range Financial Plan.
DISCUSSION
Base System
The attached MTFP for the Base System incorporates the 2019 Amended Budget with necessary
adjustments and best estimates at this time. The Base System plan drafts were presented to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee on May 7th and July 9th for discussion. The final
presentation follows in this document on September 17th with staff recommendation for Board adoption
on September 24th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2020-2025 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2019 Amended Budget. The column titled Forecast Amended Budget 2019 in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.
The Base System plan is balanced through the six-year period after incorporating into the
projections:
1) March-2019 sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business
2) Minimum/must-have requested capital and expense projects approved in the previous year’s
plan with costs in outlying years, including fleet requirements
3) High priority new project requests within State of Good Repair parameters, including fleet
requirements
4) Reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical requested projects
5) SOGR allowance in 2025
6) Use of previously-issued debt and internal funds to support planned fleet purchases
7) New COP (Certificates of Participation) financing issued in 2022 to support planned fleet
purchases
7) Contribution to reserve funds in all years of the plan
8) No service reductions other than reprogrammed fixed route service through this period

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Exhibit I summarizes the Base System 2020-2025 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $124.4 million in 2020 is based on the recommended fare change
proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. The Mid-term
Financial Plan assumes additional revenue from increasing fares in 2022 and 2025. This
revenue could come from other revenue sources that will be explored before the Board
considers a fare increase or from cost savings that would reduce the need for a fare
increase. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March-2019 semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2019-2025. In all years of the Mid-term Financial plan,
the medium baseline forecast from CU is used. Of the total forecasted amounts, 0.6% is
apportioned to the Base System. (Line 2)
o The CU-Leeds forecast contains confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The
mean forecast through 2020 is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $646.0
million on the low side and $732.3 million for the upper bound (at 1% sales/use tax
rate). The upper bound estimate is 6.1% higher than the medium baseline forecast,
meaning that it is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat
strongly over the next year. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the
forecast, with a 6.4% lower bound. The values of the high and low forecast
bounds are computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability
exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will contain the actual
value of the variable being predicted.
 Grant revenue projected receipts are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
known proceeds. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price Index (CPI) (obtained
from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2020. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary increases/reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 7)
2020:
2.6%
2021:
2.6%
2022:
2.6%
2023:
2.6%
2024:
2.6%
2025:
2.6%
 Operating expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount
through 2020 and then escalated at the CPI rate for 2021-2025.
 Operating expenses also include higher costs for purchased transportation contracts in all
years of the plan as various contracts are re-bid. The additional costs excluding start-up
costs are programmed at $7.2 million beginning in 2020 and then escalated. (Lines 8, 12)
 Service increase consists of the cost of new service projects to be operated by RTD in
2020-2022 to include the Golden FlexRide service. RTD costs will be reimbursed in full
with contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
RTD will make the
determination in future years whether to continue such service. (Line 9)
 Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, BRT, HLine extension, and SERE are fully allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource
drivers for all years of the plan. In addition, a portion of overhead costs is also allocated

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1








for the Commuter Rail Lines. Thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the amount of the
allocation. (Line 10)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at the 2019 lock price of $2.30/gallon and escalated at the national
CPI rates as follows: (Line 11)
2020:
2.2%
2021:
2.2%
2022:
2.3%
2023:
2.2%
2024:
2.3%
2025:
2.2%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.90/gallon in 2020, which is same cost per gallon used in the
2019 budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 11)
 The line item for expense projects (O&M) includes specifically identified minimum/musthave operating and maintenance projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs
in outlying years, plus high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities. These
projects are detailed in Exhibit III. Other projects may be added based on available cash
flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end. Specific
projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 12)
o It should be noted that included in the operating projects line item is an allocation to
FasTracks for certain projects that serve both the Base System and FasTracks. Also, a
SOGR allowance of $3.5 million is included in the year 2025. (Lines 12, 13)
 The FasTracks bus service, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks Financial
Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System, increases by
the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 14)
Investment income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 17)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year by
1) using debt amortization schedules for current debt and 2) forecasting new interest expense
on anticipated new debt issued based on forward interest rate curves. (Line 18)
The line items for capital expenditures includes specifically identified minimum/must-have
capital projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs in outlying years, plus the
minimum required new fleet, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities,
detailed in Exhibit II. Dollar amounts of the new fleet are determined so as not to exceed cash
flow constraints determined in the plan model. Other projects may be added based on
available cash flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at yearend. Specific projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Lines
21, 22, 23)
Regarding the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted operating
reserve:
 Staff recommends that the Board-appropriated fund be funded at a minimum of $3
million in 2020-2025. This fund is projected to reach a balance of $41.4 million in
2025. (Lines 24, 38)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund not be funded until 2024 and then
at $3 million each year through 2025. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$6.0 million in 2025. The capital replacement fund was drawn to zero in 2018 to
support capital expenditures (fleet acquisition). (Lines 25, 39)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve was established in 2017 and funded
with available cash flow. In all years of the Base System plan, the unrestricted

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1










operating fund will be funded with available cash flow, but staff recommends that the
unrestricted operating fund be drawn minimally in 2020-2022 to help balance the plan,
and then funded at $3 million annually. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$28.7 million in 2025. (Lines 26, 40)
 The total of these three funds is projected to be $76.1 million in 2025.
A transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks operations is not anticipated to
be necessary over the course of this six-year plan. (Line 27)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund.
New debt issuance of $30 million will become necessary in the plan in 2022. (Line 29)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year for current and future debt using debt amortization schedules. Principal payments
are forecast on both existing and new debt balances. (Line 30)
Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at each yearend, estimated changes to restricted reserves, available project funds, and the use of
previously-issued COP-bond proceeds for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 33, 34, 35,
36)
The plan is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a minimum unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$2 million each year through 2025 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 37)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its MTFP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the plan will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the plan, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. A comprehensive Title VI review will be
undertaken and a certification of review will be issued by the Title VI manager.
FasTracks
The underlying assumptions for FasTracks in the 2020-2025 MTFP are consistent with those used in
the Base System:
 Fare revenues are projected based on the fare structure changes approved by the Board in
September 2018, adding revenue for new lines at their projected opening dates.
 Sales and use tax projections for the 0.4% sales and use tax incorporate the March 2019
Leeds forecasts.
 Grant revenues are based on existing grant agreements and past trends, adjusted at CPI as
appropriate.
 Additional fixed guideway grants are assumed beginning nine years after corridors enter
revenue service.
 Interest income on available balance is projected using the same methodology as for the Base
System.
 The cost allocations to FasTracks from the Base System and the FasTracks plan bus service
increase feed directly from the Base System plan.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the Eagle Project are derived from the Concession
Agreement.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the North Metro project include startup costs to prepare
for revenue service under RTD operation.
 Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project are assumed at
0.3% of installed asset value, starting seven years after the corridors enter revenue service.
The total FasTracks project budget through 2020 included in the FasTracks plan is approximately $5.6
billion. There are two changes from the 2019-2024 MTFP:
 Additional funding for the North Metro settlement, approved by the Board in October 2018 $15.0 million

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.1

 Increase in estimated third party in-kind contributions for the Eagle Project, offset by an increase
in estimated revenues - $15.0 million
Project-by-project costs are included as Exhibit VII.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current plan would require identification of
funding sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore,
the FasTracks plan is a dynamic tool, which is updated annually as projects move towards completion
and any changes approved by the Board are incorporated.
The projected FasTracks cash flow through 2025 does not require Base System funding to support
FasTracks corridor operations and maintenance. However, funding from the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) will be needed in 2024 and 2025 to fund FasTracks corridor operations and
maintenance. The cash flow by year through 2025 is presented as Exhibit VIII.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended Mid-term Financial Plan provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive
unrestricted year-end fund balance in each year of the plan while growing reserve fund balances.
However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and
supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the plan, and may
challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2020 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan to a later date. This is not
recommended because the Mid-term Financial Plan identifies the capital programs, expenditures,

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.1

and service guidelines for the 2020 budget process and adoption of the plan serves as a
confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2020 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2020-2025
Mid-term Financial Plan. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the Mid-term
Financial Plan adoption and possible delay in the 2020 budget process.

Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management System (CRM)

Location
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)

Project Description
TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the Distrct.

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive

predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

Information Security TechnologySupervisory Controls Environment

Location
Project Description
Mariposa Light Rail Division Recent cyber security audits from DHS and Parsons identified several deficiencies in
the Supervisory Controls Environment (SCE) security environment. Currently, there is
no Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) within the SNE or authentication
of switch access control to the SCE domain. Additionally, a two-layer Remote Access
architecture is required since the SCE gateway is directly to the Internet. The
Supervisory Controls Department is requesting funding to purchase software and
hardware technology to support SIEM, RADIUS, and Remote Access functions within
the SCE. The target technologies are the QRadar SIEM, HP RADIUS server, and
Bomgar RAS server. These technologies will address 100% of the information security
issues identified in the cyber security audits.

Risk Management Information
System Upgrade

Blake Street Office

Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal and
external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software, we will
avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create efficiencies that
would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more proactive. The
added functionality of a new system would result in improved communication and
assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical claim histories on bodily
injury and property claims which can be a red flag for potentially fraudulent claims.
SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security Committee is dedicated to improving the
safety of employees and the general public. Enabling an automated and hands free
compilation of claims data in our enterprise data warehouse or other software
employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the Committee with facts and trends on
which to focus safety measures to reduce injuries.

Standard Security Architecture for
Supervisory Controls (SC SSA)

Mariposa Light Rail Division The existing Supervisory Controls Network (SCN) has limited cyber security features
both in the Mariposa Computer Center and Communication Houses. The SCN enables
the Light Rail OCC to operate and manage the Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) fleet from within
the Mariposa OCC. The Supervisory Controls (SC) department has adopted a Standard
Security Architecture used in Industrial Controls environments to security critical
controls from unauthorized access and comply with recent cyber security audits from
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Parsons Security. The SC SSA
establishes a high level of network compartmentalization and integrates multi-layer
security technology within the SCN to minimize propagation of Malware and
unauthorized access. Specifically, the SC SSA compartmentalizes the core computing
environment (Mariposa Computer Room) and the extended networks (Comm Houses)
to establish firewalled gateways within and between corridors to reduce networkwide Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The SC SSA also
allows for secured communication with the RTD IT environment to share Light Rail
Vehicle (LRV) and alignment data between systems. The SC SSA will address
approximately 70% of the cyber security issues identified in the recent audits.

Project Description

Cab Signaling on LRVs

Districtwide

The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted to
operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator fails
to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a predetermined
grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop.
The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all of
our current LRV fleet and the additional LRVs on order. Additionally the project funds
would provide for new signal software for each of our existing corridors that currently
have Automatic Train Stop (ATS) functionality.

equipment. If the MAUs fail, ventilation and heating will be lost in that location. New
equipment will be more energy efficient technology. Current energy code
requirements may require upgrading existing 100% outside air units to energy

These HVEC makeup air units are beyond their useful life. Maintenance is becoming
increasingly more difficult due to the age of the equipment. If the HVECs fail
thenheating, ventilation and cooling will be lost in that location. New equipment will
be more energy efficient technology. Current energy code requirements may require
upgrading existing 100% outside air units to energy recovery units. The energy
recovery units will save energy but because they are larger equipment than the
existing MAUs, structural and ductwork modifications may be required to install them.
The energy code requirements will make it necessary to evaluate and remodel HVEC
units and exhaust fans in the Maintenance End at the same time.

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

crossings, concrete flat work, etc. This is a six year plan. The alignment will be divided
into segments that can be completely refurbished within the span of one construction
season.
The Central Corridor is over 24 years old. For the most part this infrastructure has
reached its potential life span. This repair project will replace existing rail, switches,
concrete flatwork and items associated with the existing rail alignment which have
deteriorated over the past 24 years. The work will be broken down into zones based
on the priority of conditions of the rail and location. All work will include coordination
with City and County of Denver (CCD), traffic control, and public information

Longmont to Boulder @ SH 119

Longmont/Boulder

Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119
Corridor to connect Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the recommendation
of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that approximately half
of the total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in
the corridor would raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000
daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and design will be established
through environmental clearance and preliminary engineering ahead of construction.
The project is anticipated to take two years to construct.

The business case is to enhance the existing Mobile Ticketing fare collection system to
a full account-based ticketing platform. In order to do this, RTD will need to purchase
and install validators on all bus and rail cars, enable the Account-Based Ticketing
features in the Mobile Ticketing platform and convert existing card based smart card
accounts to account-based smart card accounts. Expected to be completed by January
2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M. RTD anticipates receiving
a grant for $1.8M. RTD will provide a local match of $1.8M.

The existing Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) is model ST80 and does not meet current
credit card security standards which is one of RTD s greatest security vulnerabilities.
The TVM should have P2PE, EMV and meet PCI-DSS. P2PE is a point-to-point
encryption solution which is a combination of secure devices, applications and
processes that encrypt data from the point of transaction to the bank. EMV stands for
Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. These three companies developed the chip reader
technology for secure transactions. Companies that don t use EMV will take
responsibility for fraudulent transactions. EMV (chip and pin) is a service that is visible
to our customers and they have come to know, expect, and associate with modern
security. PCI-DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which sets
the requirements for organizations and sellers to safely and securely accept, store,
process, and transmit cardholder data during credit card transaction to prevent fraud
and data breaches. Scheidt & Bachmann (S&B) has proposed an upgrade to the ST80
TVM because they are out of PCI-DSS compliance so the operating system needs to be
upgraded to Windows 10 in order to work with the FareGo back-end. This is a request
for $2,800,000 to be spent by 2022 on an open procurement to replace all ST80 TVMs
and the backend system. With this plan all of the old TVMs will have P2PE, EMV and
meet PCI-DSS by the fall of 2022.

Project Description

FlexPass Program

Blake Street Office

RTD offers to its riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The FlexPass
program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for RTD as
well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to overall
customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to choose
their service level, vary passes from month-to-month, and enter or leave the program
at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to participate
including a pre-tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5 million in
annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March 2010, RTD
contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in-house in the near future.
Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for in the immediate Smart Card
plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020. Historically this
program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no longer available.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000 in
Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in seconds. At the
same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by what
channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website, General Transit
Feed Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be
disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate appropriate
messages for all the dissemination channels.

Project Description
RTD currently is on version 12.1.3 of Oracle E-business suite. This current version of
Oracle E-business suite support will end in 2021. RTD would need to upgrade to the
next version starting 2019 or start looking at alternatives in 2018. Project is to
implement the future of business applications such as finance, HR, procurement,
recruitment, and so on. The project will assess the need to upgrade existing
technologies and/or investigate/implement new technologies for these business
functions. The project will analyze the need to move/segregate the business functions
as necessary in order to upgrade existing application or move to the cloud or SAAS

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the district.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house. As part
of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM tools,
which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems
instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project and future staffing levels will change.

Project Description
Smart Media Technology System has been operational since January 2013. Since going
live, the system has not received a refresh of the server and database operating
system. A system infrastructure upgrade, for 50 servers, is required to maintain PCI
compliance.
Project is to purchase and continually fund a suite of equipment, software and
cybersecurity specialist consulting services designed to identify security and
compliance gaps in our IT systems, remediate those gaps, and monitor for and
respond to suspicious activity in a timely manner. Assessment and mitigation requires
specialized skill sets and separation of duties (from RTD systems specialists) which are
more cost-effective and operationally effective to outsource at this time; additional
equipment and services are needed to achieve compliance and security goals such as
network separation, threat monitoring, and asset discovery.

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

The business case is to enhance the existing Mobile Ticketing fare collection system to
a full account-based ticketing platform. In order to do this, RTD will need to purchase
and install validators on all bus and rail cars, enable the Account-Based Ticketing
features in the Mobile Ticketing platform and convert existing card based smart card
accounts to account-based smart card accounts. Expected to be completed by January
2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M. RTD anticipates receiving
a grant for $1.8M. RTD will provide a local match of $1.8M.

Project Description
This is incremental funding required for the existing Clever Devices contract #16DO18 contract hosting and warranty for the service planning and scheduling software
system.
Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal and
external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software, we will
avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create efficiencies that
would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more proactive. The
added functionality of a new system would result in improved communication and
assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical claim histories on bodily
injury and property claims which can be a red flag for potentially fraudulent claims.
SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security Committee is dedicated to improving the
safety of employees and the general public. Enabling an automated and hands free
compilation of claims data in our enterprise data warehouse or other software
employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the Committee with facts and trends on
which to focus safety measures to reduce injuries.
Required by FTA 673, the Safety Management System is a tool to efficiently gather
and analyze safety data, which includes OJI (On The Job Injuries), and FTA and NDT
reportable events. Causal factors are required to be determined for each event.
Currently we use paper-based and incomplete data collection, which is cumbersome
and inefficient.
Request is for 1 FTE Cybersecurity Engineer. This position is an in-house resource for
cybersecurity operations monitoring for IT, LRT, NMRL.

RTD’s Rider Alert system was replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead Position rather than reporting directly
to the Senior Manager of Customer Care.

guide with a strong emphasis on multimodal connections and to develop a universally
legible wayfinding system connection to transit. This will improve first and last mile
connections to RTD services by standardizing wayfinding in the District and making it
easier to implement wayfinding systems in the future. RTD has committed $25,000 in
local match and Aurora and Denver has also committed a total of $25,000 in local
match. The total project budget is $250,000 and RTD s local match of $25,000 (10% of

This project is an equity training initiative intended to mitigate the risk of both Title VI
and EEO discrimination lawsuits and complaints. The training will aim to provide RTD
employees and applicable contractors with cultural competency, implicit bias
management, de-escalation tactics and a basic understanding of civil rights
requirements. To save cost, a consultant will develop a training program
incorporating a train the trainer or train the facilitator approach. The Transit Equity
and Civil Rights offices will then collaborate to extend and maintain the training
program without consultant support. Customer facing (security officers, operators,
sales outlets, etc ), senior, and executive level employees are the priority for this

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

October 16, 2019

Subject:

Approval of the 2020 Fiscal Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2018 for
the 2019 fiscal year. Those changes were related to 1) re-write of the Investment Policies section to
state that RTD financial assets are managed in accordance with the RTD Investment Policy Statement
approved annually by the RTD Board, 2) wording clarification, consisting of substitution of the words
“Mid-Term Financial Plan” where necessary, and 3) Debt Policies #5 were updated with the most recent
rating agency credit ratings in effect at that date.
DISCUSSION
For 2020, the following changes are proposed:
1) Re-write of the Revenue Policies section as follows:
a. Delete from Revenue Policy #1 the statements that “Staff will plan fare adjustments every
three years in the mid and long-term budgets to adjust for inflation” and ensuring that a
fare structure “achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan.”
b. Delete from Revenue Policy #1 the bullet point “is equitable” and replace with “addresses
equity including social and geographical.”
c. Add as Revenue Policy #2 “Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to
achieve financial levels equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in
the Mid-Term Financial Plan.” Re-number remaining Revenue Policies.
2) Add to Expenditure Policy #3 “See Asset Management Policy RTD-AMD-PLY-0001.”

Packet Pg. 41

1.B.2

3) Wording clarification consisting of substitution of the words “Mid-Term Financial Plan” for Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) where necessary. Addition of the words
“Long Range” to references to the 30-year Financial Plan.
4) Update of Debt Policies #5 with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement changes as requested may have a financial impact on the 2020
Recommended Budget, the details of which are to be determined.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2020.
2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a
fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitableaddresses equity including social and geographical
 achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan
2. Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to achieve financial levels
equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in the Mid-Term
Financial Plan.
2.3.
Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent
patrons.
3.4.
RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services.
One-time revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4.5.
RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance
the budget.
5.6.
When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help
ensure the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The
Board will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of
state financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation
that would limit or diminish revenue.
6.7.
On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and
equipment, and will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and
equipment to enhance cash flow.

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 1629, 20189

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 1629, 20189

The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.

7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2019 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2020 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.1 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.1 million is made beginning in 2020, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1 million in 2032.
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1
million in 2020 and beyond, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2040. This also assumes
an annual rate of return of 7% per year.

1.B.3

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $6.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2020 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2020 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 3 through
November 17, 2019.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2020 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2020 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD). Following is a summary of the changes for the
2020 plan year.
Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the medical premiums and
RTD/ employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the less
expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna. In year
three, 2020, premiums for participants on the CIGNA HDHP and PPO plans, will be calculated as
follows:


Cigna participants will pay 70% of the difference in premium between the Cigna plan and a like
Kaiser plan. This is an increase of 15% over the employee premium calculation for 2019.

Medical
 Kaiser HDHP
o No plan changes – 2.46% increase in premium
 Kaiser DHMO
o No plan changes – 2.38% increase in premium
 Cigna HDHP
o No plan changes – 14.61% increase in premium
 Cigna PPO
o No plan changes – 14.67 % increase in premium

Packet Pg. 62

1.B.4

Dental
 Increase to the annual maximum on the Preferred Provider Plus (PPO) plan to $2,500. The annual
premium increased by 3.3%.
 No change to the Exclusive Panel Option (EPO) Dental Plan and no change in rate.
Life & Disability
 Unum is under a rate guarantee – no changes in premium or plan design
Vision/Business Travel Accident
 Superior Vision is under a rate guarantee – no changes in rate or plan design


Business Travel Insurance is budgeted/paid on a three year basis, 2020 is year two of the most
recent contract. The 2019-2021 rate is $1900.00 total for three years, this premium is actually
approximately $100.00 less than the premium for 2016-2018.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be 1.8% above the 2019 projected
benefit costs.
The low percent of increase in the cost to RTD is directly related to the following:
 Minimal increase in premium on the KAISER plans
 Increased percent of employee paid premium for the CIGNA plans.
 Rate guarantee for Vision plan
 Rate guarantee for Unum (Life/LTD)
 Rate guarantee for the Delta EPO plan
The 2020 estimate of the Salaried Employee Health and Welfare Benefits is $11,879,972.30. This is an
increase of $213,935.13.
For 2020, the benefit costs will be budgeted in the 2020 annual budget.

1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the 2020 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General
Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2020. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay the
employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the organization being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the
contract authority amount with Cambridge Systematics. (Contract Number 15DJ005) from the current
level of $763,728.00 by $300,000 to new total contract amount of $1,063,728.00
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD selected Cambridge Systematics to develop RTD’s new Trip Planner using an Open Source Trip
planner. This trip planner replaced RTD’s existing Transtar and Google trip planners. The new trip planner
was launched in December 2016. This project under Contract Number 15DJ005 was completed in May
2017. During the lifecycle of the original project, several enhancements were requested which the
project team agreed would be reviewed after launch. In March 2018, a Sole source agreement was
awarded to Cambridge Systematics to work on these additional enhancements as Phase 2 – Open Trip
Planner Support and Maintenance. This project concluded in December 2018. RTD now has the ability to
have customers and customer care department on the same trip planner so we can service our
customers with the same information. The trip planner provides fixed route services integrated with
walking, biking and driving options.
The update to the trip planner will give us the ability to combine fixed route services with flex route
services and give the ability for customer and customer care agents to plan trips combining fixed route
and flex route services.
DISCUSSION
RTD is proposing a new Phase 3 for this project. The objective of Phase 3 is to enable Open Trip Planner
to identify itineraries that include Flex Ride services, often in combination with fixed route segments.
Flex Ride is not currently offered as an option in Trip Planner. Adding Flex Ride to Open Trip Planner will
enhance the rider’s experience by displaying more options for trip planning all in one application.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract authority increase is to provide additional functionality to Open Trip Planner by including
Flex Ride services. Funding is available in the Finance and Administration’s operations and maintenance
funds.

$1,063,728.00.
2. Continue with the existing functionality offered in Open Trip Planner and do not add Flex Ride
services.
3. Proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over a year to procure and
deploy the project.

Resolution Authorizing Refunding of Series
2010A Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of sales tax
revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado) to refund certain
outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds and the security therefor;
and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued its Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2010A to partially
finance the West Line, Eagle Project, and termination of interest rate swap agreements. The 2010A
bonds were originally issued in the amount of $79,140,000 and there is currently $76,885,000
remaining outstanding. The Bonds are callable at par on November 1, 2020, the final payment is
scheduled to occur in 2038 and the bonds have a 5.0% coupon.
The approaching call dates and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the remaining 2010A bonds to realize a reduction in interest expense.
DISCUSSION
RTD has the potential to refund the remaining outstanding Series 2010A bonds to realize, subject to
market conditions, a net present value savings of approximately $15.9 million (20.0% of principal of
refunded) between 2020 and 2038. RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of 3%
savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date
the new interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to the
interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the new
financing and the November 1, 2020 call date of the 2010A bonds (negative arbitrage). Absent a
change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in

Packet Pg. 67

1.B.6

time proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2010A bonds. Despite the
cost associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2010A bonds
exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing
team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to
reduce its interest expense.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Sales Tax
Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series 2010A with the issuance of tax-exempt bonds through a
forward delivery agreement where the securities would be priced in 2019 but not delivered to the
investors until 2020.
Drafts of documents including the Preliminary Official Statement, Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow
Agreement, and Forward Delivery Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors and Butler Snow LLP
as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The bonds will be sold through an underwriting
syndicate consisting of RBC, Harveston Securities, and Stifel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds from the sale of the bonds. These costs include financial advisory, attorney, rating agency and
miscellaneous costs. The final payment year of the new bonds will not exceed 2038, the final payment
year of the existing Series 2010A bonds that are being refinanced.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance
of sales tax revenue bonds (FasTracks Project) of the Regional Transportation District (Colorado)
to refund certain outstanding FasTrack Bonds; providing for other matters related to such Bonds
and the security therefor; and approving the execution and delivery of certain documents in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2019 related to the issuance of the RTD Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project), Series
2020A and related documents in connection with the refinancing of the RTD Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds (Fastracsk Project), Series 2010A. This is not the recommended action as it would not
take advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the district.

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery by
the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in connection with the refinancing of the
2010A Certificates of Participation (COPs).
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued its Series 2010A certificates of participation (COPs) to finance 55 new Siemens
light rail vehicles, 95 access-a-Ride vehicles, 32 Call-n-Ride vehicles, fare boxes and CAD/AVL
equipment. The 2010A COPs also refinanced the 1998A and 2001A COPs for interest expense savings.
The 2010A COPs were originally issued in the amount of $312,900,000 and there is currently
$76,885,000 remaining outstanding. The COPs are callable at par on November 1, 2020 and final
payment is scheduled to occur in 2031 and the interest rate being paid ranges from 5.0% - 5.5%.
The approaching call dates and current low interest rate environment have created an opportunity to
refinance the remaining 2010A COPs to realize a reduction in interest expense.
DISSCUSSION
RTD has the potential to refund the remaining outstanding Series 2010A COPs to realize, subject to
market conditions, a present value savings of approximately $14.8 million (19.3% of principal of
refunded COPs) between 2020 and 2031. RTD Board Policy and the Resolution require a minimum of
3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the
date the new interest rate is locked.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new financing at a return equal to the
interest expense of the new financing, and (b) the length of time between the execution of the new
financing and the June 1, 2020 call date of the 2010A COPs (negative arbitrage). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time
proceeds of the new financing must be invested prior to redeeming the 2010A COPs. Despite the cost

Packet Pg. 85

1.B.7

associated with the negative arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2010A COPs
exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing
team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to
reduce its interest expense.
RTD historically used COPs to finance vehicles and other capital projects when the budget cannot
accommodate the use of cash to fund the necessary vehicles and projects, as was the case in 2010.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the refinancing of the Series 2010A
COPs with the issuance of tax-exempt COPs through a forward delivery agreement where the securities
would be priced in 2019 but not delivered to the investors until 2020.
Drafts of documents including the Preliminary Official Statement, Lease Purchase Agreement, Escrow
Agreement, Forward Delivery Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors and Butler Snow LLP
as Bond Counsel, in regard to the transaction. The COP’s will be sold through an underwriting syndicate
consisting of JP Morgan, Harveston Securities and Jefferies.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds from the sale of the COPs. These costs include financial advisory, attorney, rating agency and
miscellaneous costs. The final payment year of the new COPs will not exceed 2031, the final payment
year of the existing Series 2010A COPs that are being refinanced.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the
execution and delivery by the RTD of a lease purchase agreement and related documents in
connection with the refinancing of the 2010A Certificates of Participation (COPs).
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2019 related to the refinancing of the Series 2010A RTD Certificates of Participation and related
documents in connection with the refinancing of the 2010A certificates of participation. This is
not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest expense savings
currently available to the district.

District herein authorized shall be conclusive evidence of the approval by the District of such
instrument in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease, the Second Amendment to Lease, the 2010 Indenture or the 2020 Certificates shall be
construed as creating or constituting a general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal
year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory
provision, nor a mandatory charge or requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year
beyond the then current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment
with respect to the 2020 Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals
(as defined in the Lease) and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be
terminated by the District in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor
the 2020 Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any
ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple
fiscal year direct or indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision
of the Lease or the 2020 Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful
delegation of governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District
within the meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the
Lease nor the 2020 Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any
payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, as amended by the Second Amendment to
Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair
rental value of the 2010 Leased Property and do not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place
the District under an economic compulsion to renew the Lease or to exercise its option to
purchase the 2010 Leased Property pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the period during which the District has an option to purchase the 2010 Leased
Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the 2010
Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee for 2010A Certificates. In
the event that the General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the
refunding of all or a portion of the 2010A Certificates and executes a Sale Certificate in
accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the Board hereby elects and hereby declares its
intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of the District its option to redeem all or a
portion of the 2010A Certificates as set forth in the Sale Certificate (the “Refunded 2010A
Certificates”), on the date or dates and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate.
Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the refunding of the 2010A Certificates, the
District hereby irrevocably instructs UMB Bank, n.a., as trustee for the 2010A Certificates to

accordance with the provisions of the Sale Certificate, the 2010 Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement related to the 2020 Refunding Project entered into between the District and the
Trustee. In accordance with the provisions of the 2010 Indenture, the District further instructs
the Trustee to recalculate the schedule of Base Rentals set forth in Exhibit B to the Lease to
reflect the principal amount and debt service requirements of the 2010 Certificates and the 2020
Certificates outstanding after implementing the 2020 Refunding Project.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2020 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2020 Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 11.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2010 Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2010 Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

2020 Budget Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 22, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made available
for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by October 15 th of
each year. RTD’s initial 2020 Requested Budget was presented at the Financial Administration and
Audit Committee (FA&A) on September 17, 2019. Public notice was given in the October 12-13, 2019
weekend editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the preliminary 2020
budget were made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information that
has become available since the presentation of the first draft 2020 Requested Budget at the FA&A
Committee. The 2020 Recommended Budget (final budget) is scheduled to be presented at the
November 12th FA&A Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for
adoption on November 19th.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes revised assumptions incorporated into the 2020
budget and resulting changes from the first draft of the 2020 Requested Budget previously presented at
the FA&A Committee. Major revisions and areas of focus include:


Sales/use taxes are revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented to
the Board on September 17th. The first draft budget incorporated the CU-Leeds School
March sales/use tax forecast, while this budget update incorporates the September
forecast as will the final Recommended Budget. In the CU-Leeds School September
forecast, 2020 sales/use tax is revised downward to increase 2.0% over the 2019
projection, which is also revised downward to increase 2.7% over 2018. The most
current sales/use tax forecast is lower by $25.2 million in 2020 compared to the Mid-Term
Financial Plan (MTFP).



Revised estimates for fare revenue have been made based on year-to-date actual data
through August and a forecast for North Metro based on a May 2020 opening. Fare
revenue is now estimated to be lower by $17.1 million in 2020 compared to the MTFP.



The total of 2020 fare revenue and sales/use tax revenue shortfalls from the MTFP is
$42.3 million.



Staff has made targeted reductions in operating expenses from the first draft Requested
Budget previously presented at FA&A Committee. The budget that is available in the
Board Office for public review includes all of the reductions identified to date. Further
operating expense reductions will be made by all departments to meet the operating

Packet Pg. 123

1.C.2

expense target established in the MTFP and to make up for the estimated shortfalls from
the MTFP in sales/use tax revenue and fare revenue. The goal is a balanced 2020
Recommended Budget to be presented to the Board on November 12th.


Base System reductions planned to balance the final budget are as follows:

*subject to change


An executed diesel fuel lock for 2020 will have positive benefit. Diesel fuel is budgeted at
a locked price of $2.00/gallon for 2020, down from the budgeted price of $2.30/gallon.
The favorable impact from the 2020 price lock is $3.0 million.



Gasoline remains budgeted at $2.90/gallon, same as the 2019 budgeted price.



The total capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time
but will be included in the final Recommended Budget.



The FasTracks budget is able to withstand its share of the revenue shortfall to MTFP and
maintain a balanced budget in 2020.



In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital
Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Fund are established at 3 months of operating
expenses.



The Base System Unrestricted Fund balance is targeted at $2.0 million, which is the
projected fund balance in the MTFP. This target remains a viable goal after adjusting for
the above-noted revenue items and expense reductions. The Base System will not meet

Packet Pg. 124

1.C.2

the goal of 3 months of operating expenses in fund balances in 2020 but is estimated to
have approximately 1 month of operating expenses in fund balances in 2020.

Subject:

2020 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 22, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they should integrate with the Board’s priorities for the coming
year.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2020 are
brought to the Board of Directors for review and discussion at this time because the measures are
used in development of the 2020 Budget. The final 2020 performance measures will be presented to
the Board at the November 12th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request
to forward to the Board for adoption on November 19th.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2019 to 2020 are listed below:


Goal 6.2 Increase in ridership
o It is recommended that the ridership increase for 2020 be established at 0.8% based on
estimates for ridership for 2019 and 2020. Overall system ridership is projected to be
flat for the Base System with any ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. Full-year
G Line and SERE numbers are factored in as well as mid-year opening of the N line. The
measure includes all passenger boardings not limited to revenue ridership; ridership
estimates for the Mall Shuttle and Free MetroRide are included. The measure is based
on preliminary estimates and may change with the final 2020 budget.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2020 be established at 2.5%.
This is the percentage increase in estimated fare revenue over the 2019 projection. It is
based on ridership estimates and assumes full-year ridership for the G Line and SERE
and half-year ridership for the N Line. The measure is based on preliminary estimates
and may change with the final 2020 budget.
o It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2020 be established at
2.3%. This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the preliminary
2020 budget over the 2019 projection. The measure is based on preliminary estimates
and may change with the final 2020 budget.

Packet Pg. 137

1.C.3



Goal 6.5 Maintain bus/light rail operator headcount and bus mechanic headcount within
authorization.
o A change is proposed to add the measurement of Light Rail operator vacancies at ≤
5.0% and light rail operators over headcount at ≤ 4.0%. This mirrors the same
measure for bus operators. It is deemed relevant due to system growth and the need to
monitor operator hiring in current labor markets.

With the addition of the measurement for light rail operator vacancies/headcount, there will be 42
proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM which is one higher than for 2019.
Also, it should be noted that the footnote to Goal 1.4 Reduce the number of light rail accidents includes
a new statement as follows: We will report the actual number of preventable accidents at each
reporting period.
The 2020 performance measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2020 budget.

Subject:

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 22, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors, which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in June 2019. Per Board policy, we continue to report periodically on the status of the Task
Force recommendations below. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded comments
are provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds each March and September.
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate new FasTracks lines opened since 2016 and further service modifications may come
forward with the opening of new lines or to meet budget restrictions. Certain service revisions are made
with each runboard period in response to public feedback, internal ridership and utilization data. The
Reimagine RTD Project will review service optimization as part of the project scope.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses among applicable funds for both the Base System and FasTracks Operations. While
FasTracks has met this objective, the Base System has not and is not expected to fully meet this goal
within the six-year term of the Mid-term Financial Plan.

1.C.5

Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,
exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in 2014.
Technology and Energy Innovation
In response to the Task Force recommendation, RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating
facilities and installed equipment and lighting upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy
upgrades throughout the District in each annual budget. We will continue to address energy efficiency
in building systems as on-going projects are completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the University of Colorado A Line and creating
an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer BRT line. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate
sponsorship contracts will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, partnering
with the City & County of Denver on Route 15L improvements, partnering with the City & County of
Denver on the 16th Street Mall to receive a grant and share in the O&M costs, as well as TOD activities.
RTD continues to look for partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons who park longer than
24 hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature prohibited the charging of daily
parking fees to in-District patrons at District facilities. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking
management briefing at a study session that focused on a consultant-led pay-for-parking study. In late
2016, the Board approved the Parking Guiding Principles, which clarify how future changes to parking
policy will be evaluated.

Packet Pg. 160

1.C.5

Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As noted earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items
taxed.

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 16, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 22, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will transition to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

1.C.6

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of October 13thth, 2,107 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 1,154 have been
approved, 611 have been denied and the remaining 342 are pending. Of the 661 denied, 410 of them
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 144 were denied because their address was out of District, 7 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 2 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 3 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 45 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold.
