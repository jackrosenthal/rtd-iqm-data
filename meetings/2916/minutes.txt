B. Recommended Actions

• Adoption of the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the October 29, 2019

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Motion to
Amend:

Director Cook made the motion to amend the
2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan by removing
“The fare revenue through the six-year period is
sourced from assumptions in the fare change
proposal and a fare rate increase in 2022 and
2055” and replacing it with the following
language, “The Mid-Term Financial Plan assumes
additional revenue from increasing fares in 2022
and 2025. This revenue could come from other
revenue sources that will be explored before the
Board considers a fare increase or cost savings
that would reduce the need for a fare increase”.
