GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

IX.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

North Metro Corridor – Release of Final Environmental Impact Statement
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to release the North Metro Corridor Final
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for public and agency review. This is a
critical step in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and provides
the public and interested agencies with an opportunity to review the document
and provide comments.

B.

Authorization to Execute Agreements for Property Acquisition, Relocation and
Construction and Joint Corridor Operations with the BNSF Railway Company
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into the following agreements
with the BNSF Railway Company:


a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) for Acquisition of property interests
from DUS to approximately 71St Street in Westminster along BNSF’s
Front Range Subdivision (the DUS Corridor), along the BNSF Golden
Subdivision from approximately Sheridan to the end (the Gold Corridor).





a Relocation and Construction Agreement (Construction Agreement) for
relocation and construction of BNSF facilities required to make the
acquired property interests available to RTD for its use on the Eagle P-3
and other commuter rail projects
a Joint Corridor Use Agreement (JCUA) with the BNSF Railway Company
(BNSF) governing ongoing operations between the two entities in the
shared corridors.

It is recommended that the General Manager is authorized to acquire property
interests described in the PSA in the amount of $102,674,484; that he is
authorized to pay as contracted lump sum payments to BNSF $24.13 million for
relocation and construction of BNSF improvements between Denver Union
Station (DUS) and Pecos Streets, $7.68 million for relocation and construction of
improvements on the Gold Line between approximately Sheridan and Ward Road,
and $5.1 million for relocation and construction between Pecos and
approximately 71st streets. It is further recommended that (1) the amount of
$200,000 for title insurance, closing costs, escrow fees and other costs
incidental to execution of the PSA and (2) $4,000,000 for direct reimbursement
costs to BNSF for additional construction and relocation expenses incidental to
both BNSF relocation and RTD construction, plus a contingency for delays, minor
changes including changes in the square footage of real estate, or other non-fixed
expenses, be budgeted authorized and appropriated, and that the General
Manager is authorized to make reasonable and necessary expenditures for all
such items within the amounts authorized. This would bring the total cost of the
agreements with BNSF to $143,784,484.
Funding for the BNSF agreement is included in the 2010 Adopted Budget for
FasTracks, and in the FasTracks financial plan approved by the Board of Directors
in February 2010.
It is further recommended that the Board authorize the following budget transfers
to fund the PSA, costs incidental to the execution of the PSA, direct
reimbursement costs, and the portion of the relocation payments due in 2010.
This action will accelerate a portion of the funding previously budgeted in 2011
into 2010 to match the terms of the final agreement, and will allocate the
budgeted funds to the following FasTracks projects.
Northwest Rail
Gold Line
System Improvements
FasTracks Contingency Reserve
It is further recommended that the Board pass the attached resolution authorizing
execution of the Agreements, and agreeing to waive governmental immunity,
acquire insurance for and indemnify the BNSF for all claims for injuries and
damages to persons or property, including environmental liability, for which BNSF
would not incur liability but for their authorization of RTD’s use of the right of
way they currently own. A total of $125,874,484 is appropriated through the

current action. An additional $13,710,000 will be appropriated in the 2010
Amended Budget to fully fund this transaction as required by the Agreements.
C.

Smart Media Technology Contract Award-revised
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract for the Smart Media Technology (SMT)
project to ACS Transport Solutions, Inc. of Columbia, Maryland in an amount notto-exceed $15,350,000.

D.

Modifications to Investment Policy
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors approve modifications to the District’s Investment Policy to effectuate
the utilization of the 3-month U.S. T- Bill Index as published by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch as the performance benchmark for the liquidity tier of its
unrestricted portfolio.
It is further recommended that the Board of Directors approve shortening the
target duration of the non-cash/cash equivalents portion of the portfolio from
approximately 1.6 years to 1 year to accommodate cash flow demands imposed
by current and upcoming capital projects while retaining the currently defined
benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index) for
this portfolio tier.

E.

Legacy UniVerse Developer Consulting
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to extend the contract with 5280
Solutions, for the amount not to exceed of $249,600, for UniVerse Developer
services. The current three year contract with 5280 Solutions expires on April
30, 2010. The contract is being brought to the Board because it is a Personal
Services contract per RTD Resolution No.27, Series of 1985.

F.

Revised Fiscal Policy Statements 2010
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors modify and update the Fiscal Policy Statements as attached.

G.

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee to approve the
transfer of $374,050 HOP vehicle replacement funds from the capital budget to
the expense budget to accommodate the local share payment to Special Transit.

H.

FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments
It is recommended by the Nominating Committee for the FasTracks Citizens
