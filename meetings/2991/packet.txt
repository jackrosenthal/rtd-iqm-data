BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Board of Directors

Date: April 8, 2020

From:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager

GM

Date:

April 8, 2020

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2020

Subject:

Revisions to Code of Conduct

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board adopt the attached revised Code of Conduct as amended and
authorize the GM/CEO to revise the code of conduct in the future but only in the event of a declared
state or national emergency. Any changes made by the GM/CEO must be ratified by the Board within 14
days.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership
Task Goal #4 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The Code of Conduct was adopted in 2016 for the purpose of regulating behavior on RTD vehicles,
facilities and property. The Code allows RTD to regulate conduct through civil action by suspending
individuals from using transit services or removing individuals from RTD facilities or property.
DISCUSSION
The Code of Conduct needs to be revised to reflect changes in how RTD manages its transit services
and facilities. The following is a summary of the proposed changes:


Clarifies ambiguous language;



Prohibits obstruction of accessible features such as ramps and high blocks:
o



Paragraph 23: Obstructing disabled passengers from accessing features necessary to
enable disabled passengers to use transit services such as ramps, lifts and high blocks.

Prohibits individuals from remaining at a transit facility after being asked to leave:
o

Paragraph 35: Remaining at a facility after being asked to leave, for violation of this Code
or other applicable rules. RTD may, in its sole discretion, regulate the movement of
individuals to enable the provision of transit services. Facilities are to be used only for
travel-related purposes, except when a permit is otherwise granted, so that passengers
can utilize the transit system in a safe and efficient manner without inconvenience or
delay.

Outside of the Code of Conduct, RTD’s General Manager already has the authority to issue reasonable
rules and policies to manage RTD property.

“Enforcement”). Prohibited conduct is subject to reasonable modification under the Americans with
Disabilities Act (see Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”).

programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services, when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
• Create undue financial and administrative burdens

proper fare has been paid may be treated in accordance with Colorado Traffic Code 42-4-1416.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, illegal activity may result in citation under any
applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation or ordinance, including Colorado State Statutes 18-9114 - Hindering Transportation (Class 2 Misdemeanor), and CRS 18-9-115 - Endangering Public
Transportation and Utility Transmission (Class 3 Felony).
This Code of Conduct does not seek to limit, replace, or conflict with any federal, state, or
local law, regulation or ordinance, and does not limit or prevent any law enforcement

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.33% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in March 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (March) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:





March 2020 – 756.05 hours
March 2019 – 1226.11 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 943.92 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 1731.57 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in March were unplanned bus bridges, special
events, a few snowstorms, and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.33% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 2,457 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 19,656 hours of service being provided
by a “6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 1,955 shifts, or approximately 16,114 hours of service, with operators working a
“6th day”.

•

Douglas Howey – At November APAC meeting, I recommended APAC discuss RTD denying
eligibility for those in wheelchairs. In the last 2 years 360 people who are confined to wheelchairs
have been denied access to Access-a-Ride. I received a letter from RTD in January stating the legal
justification for these denials was based on an FTA Circular which is not a legal document. I have
also had multiple discussions with RTD staff, and the denials continue. I recommend APAC take
up this issue; APAC discuss RTD’s denying wheelchair bound people access to paratransit.
o NOTE: Clarifications following the meeting: The RTD letter Mr. Howey referenced was
from the former RTD General Manager, David Genova. That document, and RTDs
conversations with Mr. Howey have pointed out that:
▪ The FTA/Federal Circular (which is a guidance document to recipients of FTA
funding) provides guidance to carry out the provisions of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the US DOT regulations pertaining to the ADA in
49 CFR parts 27, 37, 38 and 39. The circular and our triennial review by the FTA
indicate that we are in full compliance;
▪ Those Access-a-Ride customers using wheelchairs who were denied

unconditional access, instead received conditional access based on their
Functional Assessment.
II.

Update on ACPD’s January meeting from APAC Liaison (William Gross)
•

•

•

ADA hero awards – 4 people, including 2 bus operators (1 Access-a-Ride operator and one who
helped with a wheelchair dead battery).
Denver ADA coordinator – met new Denver coordinator Bill Flowers
Highblock discussion (raised platform to access vehicles above ground level) – on-going
discussion. The problem is mostly with people with strollers and stroller type things crowding the
high-blocks. There have been discussions with other transit agencies, checking Federal
Regulations, and looking at signage on/near high-blocks.
Snow removal (around bus stops) – This is a difficult issue as bus stops are city/town property,
not RTDs, but lack of removal or piled snow near/on bus stops create danger and sometimes
inability to access the bus at stops. Questions of who is responsible were raised, without clarity.

ACPD Chair, Jamie Lewis, sent a letter last week to mayors about the importance of snow
removal at/around bus stops for paratransit riders. No responses yet.
o Question: Can APAC get data on how many accidents have occurred at/around bus stops
due to snow?
Answer: Yes, but data may not be thorough, the RTD complaint line may not have
captured incidents since bus stops are city property.
Met Erin Vallejos, RTD Manger of Contracted Services.
Paulette Tonilas, RTD Assistant General Manager, Communications, discussed the driver shortage
and possible fixed-routes to be eliminated.
FYI - APAC Membership – replacements and vacancies (Jody Erikson, Facilitator)

FYI – Clarification on statement in 1/14/20 meeting summary:
In the 1/4/20 meeting summary: “The problem is when a driver cannot find the apartment, and once the
first trip is a “no show” all other trips are canceled.”

Updates

1. RTD covid-19 Response and Prevention
• Policy shift – Restrict all reservations to 1-day in advance only. This includes ceasing subscription
trips (automatic reservations), these must be made the day before each time. Subscriptions were
removed for RTD to be able to act more quickly in responding to ever changing restrictions and
needs with the fewest impacts on passengers - if all reservation are made the day before,
changes can be made quickly and set passengers expectations.
o When physical distancing and other virus restrictions are removed subscription
reservations will be automatically reinstated, passengers will not need to resubmit the
subscription.
• Level of Service – Level of service for Access-a-Ride is not being reduced by RTD, although service
is down from a typical 2700-2800 riders a day to about 300 riders – people are taking virus
restriction seriously.
• Prevention: 1. Increase physical distancing by trying to have only 1 passenger on-board a vehicle
(with their aides) with the operator; and 2. Wiping down/disinfecting vehicles daily, sometimes
operators are doing it or non-driving operators (due to low demand for service), this includes
contractors policing break rooms to ensure no large groupings, and wiping down centers.
• Eligibility: the following is a summary was emailed following the meeting (some was verbalized)
o New applicants: will be provided with temporary presumptive eligibility of 120 days
o Recertification applicants:
▪ Automatic: Where there are no changes in their status-these will be processed as
quickly as possible
▪ Need of assessment: A change in mobility or device has occurred-these will be
extended 120 days and they can schedule the assessment when convenient for
them within that time frame, (this has now been set as an “open” time-frame,
and customers are being given temporary eligibility until we are able to resume
functional assessments)
o Appeals: (until hearing can be scheduled)
▪ Seeking unrestricted service - granted temporary unrestricted service
▪ Seeking service after denial - given presumptive eligibility
o Customers will be responsible for scheduling their assessments before the expiration of
the date on their letters. As of 3/30/2020 customers will be contacted as soon as we are
able to resume functional assessments and given an appointment as soon as practicable.
o Once certification calendar opens up, we will be reaching out first to those who have
most recently applied
Discussion/Questions
• Question: What can passengers do to ensure the safety of drivers and themselves?
SUGGESTION: Post a list of things passengers can do to ensure safety of co-passengers and
drivers, things like – keep yourself clean, wash hands before getting on a vehicle, etc.
2. Fixed Route Driver Shortage Impact on Access-a-Ride riders (current and/or future)
Larry Buter confirmed the RTD Board made it clear that any possible service changes would not change
Access-a-Ride service. Currently (before virus impacts) Access-a-Ride did not have a driver shortage; 6
months ago, there was a 10% shortage, but now it is at nearly full employment.

3. Technical updates - Mobile App and real-time technology
Brandon Fowler, Intelligent Transportation System Administrator at RTD, gave an update on the customer
portal/mobile application development. It is almost ready for testing. This portal is intended to be
accessible by computer or smart phone and provide:
• Reservation - ability to book and cancel future trips, and review future trip details. The future
trip request section includes: date, time, address and ability to cancel trip 2+ hours in
advance. Once a trip is booked the system, the system will assess trip availability and give a
confirmation number (success) or tell you why the trip is not able to be reserved (fail).
• Near real time trip status - traffic based pick up/drop off ETAs and map (with additional stops
in between shown).
Testing for accessibility of the system was/is being reviewed by: 1. RTD internally; 2. a third party WCAD
contractor; and 3. APAC members. Currently, the plan scheduled is to provide APAC members an
opportunity to review the system around August 2020. All testing will be done prior to release to the
public.
Discussion/Questions
• Excited, we’ve waited a long time for this, APAC has been talking about it for years.
• Good news.
• Question: Will APAC members be able to test it out before public release?
Answer: Yes in/about August.
• SUGGESTION: Do the testing in-person with people.
• Question: Will the application connect to Route Match reservation system directly or will
there need to be an interim step?
Answer: It will connect directly to Route Match, driver tablet updates, etc. This means drivers
need to be more diligent with tablet check-ins to ensure accurate ETAs and map.
• SUGGESTION: Develop a podcast/video introduction of the system and teach people how to
use it.

Next Steps
• May 12, 2020 Next APAC
• Remaining 2020 APAC Meetings: July 14; September 8; & November 10

Tonight, the RTD Board is planning to decide on May 2020 service changes due to driver shortage. The
Board is likely to also consider the covid-19 implications. The message from the Board has been that
changes will not impact Access-a-Ride.

DENVER (March 30, 2020) – Starting today, home grocery delivery service is available to
all of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)’s Access-a-Ride customers.

“We are well aware that during a state of emergency, one of the first things people can
lose access to is food,” said Paul Hamilton, senior manager of paratransit services. “When
the public is being told to reduce their exposure to others, the last thing we want to do is
ask them to leave their homes if they don’t have to. We are pleased to help our
customers where they are, and we appreciate the grocers and food banks that are
working with us to provide people with this crucial service.”
Grocery pickup is now available from King Soopers, Safeway, Community Ministry
Southwest food bank, Senior Hub Senior Solutions and Adams County Food Bank. As
additional food bank and grocery store locations are made available, that information will
be shared on RTD’s website. Vendors interested in participating in this service should
contact RTD at 303-299-6000.
Access-a-Ride customers can continue to book trips for essential purposes, including to
purchase groceries. More details are on the Access-a-Ride webpage.
Customers interested in using grocery pickup service should note the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

They must call or go online themselves to set up an order and pickup time.
Once an order has been made and a scheduled pickup time has been established
from a participating grocer or food bank, call Access-a-Ride reservations at 303292-6560 and book a trip to have the groceries picked up at that time.
Reservations staff must have the address of the grocer or food bank, as well as
the scheduled date and pickup time.
Drivers cannot step inside homes. If a front door is not visible from the curb,
please provide a contact phone number so you can be notified when the driver
has arrived.
Please do not order frozen food, as orders may be onboard a vehicle for over an
hour.
Please note the time provided when your grocery delivery is scheduled. Groceries
cannot be left at an unattended address.

On March 23rd, the Access-a-Ride program engaged the Region 8 office of the FTA for
permission to extend food delivery to our Access-a-Ride customers without requiring them
to ride the bus. This was done to allow those customers access to food, while increasing
their safety by reducing their need to travel and risk increased exposure to the COVID-19
virus. On March 24th, a formal written request was made via the FTA emergency relief
docket I.D. FTA-2020-0001-0001.
Input from the FTA relevant to allowing this service are from their FAQ page and include:
Q: How can FTA funding support transit agency response measures?
A: FTA grantees may use their Urbanized Area Formula Grants (Section
5307) and Formula Grants for Rural Areas (Section 5311) funds to take protective
measures to protect health and safety, such as cleaning of rolling stock, which is
considered preventive maintenance (a capital expense) and is eligible for an 80percent federal match. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and other measures are
eligible as either a maintenance or operating expense, whichever is appropriate.
In an earlier FAQ prior to the passing of the CARES bill, FTA additionally indicated that it:
Will permit Urbanized Area Formula Program or Formula Grants for Rural Areas
Program funding to be used for COVID-19-related public transportation capital or
operating expenses at an 80 percent federal share, regardless of whether operating
expenses generally are an eligible expense for a recipient.
Collectively armed with an understanding that such a valuable service met with FTA
allowable service and realizing the need to provide our customers with a safe food delivery
alternative without public exposure, our Access-a-Ride staff began reaching out to Food
Banks and Grocers in the Denver urbanized area.
• Three food banks initially indicated their desire to allow for the pickup of shelfstable food; that number has now grown to six.
• King Soopers and Safeway were also identified as having a grocery pickup
service for customers which did not require POS payment.
• Service began on April 3rd. While initially slow, service demand has grown
each day with between 6-10 deliveries, (replacing 10 customer roundtrips).
This equates to 7% of our current trip demand.
• Outreach to our customers includes:
o Direct callouts to customers having recently booking trips to a grocer
using AaR.
o Flyers on the bus advising our customers of the service.
o Website language promoting and describing the service.
o Media outreach by communications with local news outlets via press
release.
o Hold messaging for customers waiting to book trips.

Scripting by our agents to let them know about this free alternative to
direct purchase of their groceries.

As we have a week of experience under our belt, we’ve continued to better understand both
marketing opportunities, and service limitations. These include:
•

•
•
•

•

Use of the grocery delivery option requires both access to, and knowledge of, internet
or smart phone app use to order, pay for, and set-up delivery of groceries. Our
customer base identified themselves, as recently as the summer of 2019, as having
no more than 40% who fit into this category.
Currently, only 10% of our riders have been shown to use Access-a-Ride for trips to
the grocery store.
Continued advertising and outreach may increase our reach as more AaR customers
need an alternative to travel during the COVID-19 outbreak and response.
We are continuing to refine our delivery process as we learn more from our drivers
about their understanding of this service. We’ve learned that our demographic were
not previously adopters of grocery pick-up and delivery. Education is required of our
reservations staff and drivers, as well as our customers to assure a smooth delivery
process.
Our scheduling software is not easily adaptable to tracking non-customers. We are
working with our software vendor, Routematch, and in-house to develop workaround
reporting mechanisms.

None of these concerns are viewed as limiting the outreach of the program going forward.
There are training and marketing opportunities as we continue to reach out to our customer
base and additional food banks and grocers.

BOARD INITIATED ACTION ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Date: April 9, 2020

From:

Barbara G McManus,
Board Office

Date:

April 9, 2020

Subject:

Addition of Information Section to Committee
Agendas

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board adopt a ministerial change to the format
of committee meeting agendas to include a section for informational items not intended for discussion
during meetings unless expressly requested by one or more Directors.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 – Strong and Ethical Leadership
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
Meeting agendas reflect the established order of business. For Board and Committee Meetings, the order
of business is described in the Board Bylaws, specifically Art. V, §4 and Art. VI, §1(f), respectively.
For a typical committee meeting, the agenda includes the following standard items: A) Call to Order; B)
Recommended Actions; C) Updates; D) Other Matters; E) Next Meeting Date; F) Adjourn.
Directors have expressed on several occasions an interest in truncating the duration of committee
meetings. At the same time, the Board has indicated its desire to continue to receive ample information
to inform the decision-making process.
DISCUSSION
For a given agenda, this ministerial change would allow staff to include a section, between Updates and
Other Matters, specifically intended for items of recurring, non-actionable, and informational nature.
These items are not intended to be presented or discussed by staff; should questions arise or
clarification be needed for any Director while reviewing the agenda, the Director would contact staff in
advance of the meeting as needed. Should the Director feel further discussion is warranted during the
meeting, the Director would then submit a request, both to the chair of the appropriate committee and
to the Executive Manager of the Board Office, as far in advance as practicable, asking that the item be
opened for questions or discussion as necessary. Advance notice of such request ensures that the
appropriate staff resources can be available during the meeting to present information and respond to
questions and comments as necessary.

Packet Pg. 40

2.B.1

This action is an attempt to strike a balance between the timely and transparent dissemination of
information to the Board and the desire to employ additional time management practices during
committee meetings. Should this action be adopted by the Board, Directors are encouraged to continue
to make inquiries of appropriate staff prior to meetings to the greatest extent possible, as contemplated
in the Board Operating Guidelines, adopted February 2019
Following this change, the typical order of business for committee agendas would be as follows: A) Call
to Order; B) Recommended Actions; C) Updates; D) Information; E) Other Matters; F) Next Meeting
Date; G) Adjourn.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No additional expenditure is necessary as a result of the adoption of this item. Rather, increased meeting
efficiency would result in moderate cost savings as a result of reduced need for support staff and facility
resources.

The thought would be that after review if there were any questions on the
information items that they would be sent to the Board office to have staff address
them. We could either send the questions and responses directly to the full Board for
review or address only those question and answers briefly in committee.

2.C.3.a

Parameters of PFPP from November 2019 Board Action
• Goal is to test relationship between fares and ridership
• All fares for the N-line from Union Station to 124th will be the local fare
for the opening 6 months of revenue operation
• Fares for 112th Station and 124th Station will revert back to regional fare
after 6 months
• At the end of 12 months, RTD staff will conduct an analysis of ridership
and revenue impacts to present to the Board
• Based on the documented results of the PPFP the Board may choose to
apply this same 6-month pilot approach to other corridors

Recap of February Board Update.
• Staff relayed to the Board FTA's feedback on
Program:
• There is flexibility to include more than one corridor in the
initial 6-month promotional fare pilot
• Rolling 6-month pilot programs could also be allowed, but
that approach may necessitate fare equity analyses prior to
initiating each subsequent pilot

Equity Considerations for Promotions
• Title VI requires a fare equity analysis for all fare changes regardless
of the amount of increase or decrease to determine if the change has
a discriminatory impact based on race, color or national origin.
• Exceptions for mitigating measures and promotions up to 6 months.
• To make a fare reduction permanent, an equity analysis must
establish the change has no discriminatory impact.
• Expanding the Local Zone means that riders from areas already
within the Local Zone along the N Line do not receive the benefit of
the promotion.
• Always a potential that individuals file a Title VI complaint with FTA.

Staff Recommendation
• Recommend continuing forward with Option 1: N-Line Only
(as approved by the Board in November 2019)
• Reasons:

• COVID 19 situation provides uncertainty for RTD financially, so focusing on the
least costly option is important
• Least complicated to implement and communicate and work to implement is
already underway
• Larger fare changes (such as Option 2A and 2B) should be implemented with a
public process and more detailed analysis on impacts
• Option 1 will provide RTD with valuable insights to inform future fare
considerations

Next Steps
• April 2020 FA&A Committee - Board to provide staff feedback
• May 2020 FA&A Committee (if necessary)
• if Board desires to modify current PFPP, staff brings back as
an Action Item a new preferred option to ensure
implementation by planned N-Line opening date
• if Board desires to retain current structure and direction
for PFPP along the N-Line, no further action necessary

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

April 8, 2020

Subject:

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 8, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 14, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.

DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 93

2.C.5

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of April 5, 2020, 8,404 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 5,262 have been approved,
2,067 have been denied and the remaining 1,075 are pending. Of the 2,067 denied, 1,403 were denied
because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better discount.
449 were denied because their address was out of District, 44 were denied because it was a duplicate
application, 30 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 7 were denied because they
did not respond to requests for additional information, and 134 were denied because they did not meet
the income threshold. Of the 1,075 pending applications, 896 lack an uploaded photo and 179 are
pending for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for
LiVE.
We have seen a significant drop in applications since the social distancing measures related to the
COVID-19 pandemic went into effect. The number of approved applications per week decreased by 59%
from an average of 231 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 95 in the following
three weeks. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation, we have seen a higher percentage of applicants
who apply for LiVE at the same time as they apply for other benefit programs, or shortly thereafter.

In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:



LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the

MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application outreach worker helping interested individuals apply
at rotating locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. RTD and
Denver Human Services have agreed to pursue this option.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,

Packet Pg. 95

starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone until the offices re-open.

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
RTD outreach staff are pursuing alternative channels of communication since in-person
outreach is not currently an option.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is meeting with homeless services providers to discuss ideas that would eliminate or
shorten the wait time between the LiVE application and the client’s ability to use the
discounted tickets.

Complete and execute the amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City
and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach worker.
Work with the Governor’s Office of Information Technology to determine the detailed
requirements for the planned PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE application and
application processing.
Develop questions for the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the
LiVE program.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.

The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers, partner
organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program. This will include
re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.
