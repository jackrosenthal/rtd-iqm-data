L.

Rapid Transit Station Addition Policy
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt this policy, which updates the District’s current established
procedures and guidelines for evaluating proposed new stations on RTD’s existing
and planned light rail and commuter rail lines. Since each potential station and
station area is unique, no one set of guidelines should determine whether a
station is appropriate for a specific site. The criteria described below are meant to
serve as a policy framework for issues that should be considered when planning
for and approving new stations. RTD staff will evaluate each of the criteria, and
provide the results for the RTD Board’s information when considering the
approval of a new station. Final determination regarding whether new stations
will be added to light rail and commuter rail lines, and who will provide associated
funding of new stations, will be a Board decision on a case by case basis.

M.

Authorization to Execute Memorandum of Understanding for Property Acquisition
with the BNSF Railway
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of

Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a

regarding the acquisition of property interests from Denver Union Station to
approximately 72nd Street for the Northwest and Gold Rail Lines along BNSF’s
Front Range Subdivision, and for the Gold Line on BNSF’s Golden Subdivision.
The Memorandum of Understanding will set forth price for the segments but
actual contracts for the purchase and sale of interests and for construction and
use of the property interests will be entered into according to the parameters
described in the MOU.
