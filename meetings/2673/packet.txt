Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for August 1:
1. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) Transportation Advisory Committee – The MMC
Transportation Advisory Committee met on July 17. The mayors on the committee
remain committed to a 2018 statewide initiated measure and recognize how critical it is to
invest in the statewide system. Last year, the mayors talked about pursuing parallel
tracks (statewide and regional) but quickly became focused on a statewide solution when
the coalition found traction with the legislature. Given the failure of the legislature to act,
the MM is discussing a parallel track concept (e.g. pursuing a single large (50+ member)
RTA, multiple sub-regional RTAs, and/or new enabling legislation for a MTD. All
would be exceptionally difficult. The next full caucus meeting is August 2 from 7:30-10
A.M. Meetings are held at the Metro Denver Chamber, 1445 Market St.
2. Local Elections – CRL continues to monitor candidate filings for local municipal
elections this coming November. Municipalities within RTD’s service area holding
elections include: Arvada, Aurora, Boulder, Brighton, Broomfield, Centennial,
Commerce City, Edgewater, Englewood, Golden, Greenwood Village, Lafayette,
Lakewood, Littleton, Longmont, Louisville, Northglenn, Sheridan, Thornton,
Westminster, and Wheat Ridge. Candidates must file petitions for nomination by August
28. We will provide a complete “snapshot” of candidates as soon as ballots are certified.
3. Denver GO Bond – Mayor Hancock Mayor submitted his project recommendations to
the City Council on July 12. The revised list included many additional projects added to
the Executive Committee’s recommendations (e.g. seven transportation and mobility
projects). The list represents a $937 million investment package - $887 million in projects
and $50 million in contingency. Council will be meeting to deliberate and refer a final list
to the November ballot. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found at:

Re:

August Board Update

On June 29th the Department of Revenue alerted RTD’s attorneys to a drafting error in SB 267 that
impacted the ability of the Regional Transportation District, Scientific Cultural and Facilities District, and
certain other special districts to continue to collect the 2.9 percent state sales tax on retail marijuana
sales. The impact of the state marijuana sales tax exemption created in the bill was presumed to be
made whole by an increase in the rate of special sales tax collected on retail marijuana. This agreement
to make all parties whole was the understanding of the bill sponsors, the Governor’s Office, Legislative
Council and all parties that worked on the legislation. Since the notification RTD, SCFD, OSPB, AG’s
office and BBMK have been working to address the issue and we are in agreement the issue will be
corrected.
The Joint Budget Committee (JBC) met in mid-June to discuss the economic and budget forecasts from
Legislative Council and the Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB). The June forecast is typically
the least influential, as it is the furthest away from the timeframe (March) that the legislature actually
creates a budget. This is the first forecast that included the impacts of SB17-267 which made the
Hospital Provider Fee an enterprise fund.
Highlights include the following:
Both forecasts agree that Colorado’s economy overall is very strong, though not all areas of the state are
seeing the same growth. However, the economy may be operating at its peak level with such a tight
labor market that there is increased pressure on wages and corporate profits in some industries.
According to the report by the OSPB, this is the eighth straight year of economic expansion, making it
the third longest expansion in US history.
Both forecasts show a shortfall for the current 16/17 budget of approximately $130 million. Both
assume that this shortfall will be covered by the statutory reserve.
Assuming that the 16/17 shortfall is covered by the reserve, the estimate of additional revenue available
to spend for 18/19 (the budget that the legislature will set in the 2018 session) is between $222 million
and $531 million. Rep. Hamner pointed out that to keep K-12 funding steady for inflation and
enrollment in 18/19 will cost approximately $200 million.
SB17-267 absolutely improved the overall budget picture for the State. However, Colorado remains in a
tight budget climate with limited resources to spend on new programs. Attached is the Colorado
Department of Transportation’s overview of the transportation funding provided to the state by SB267.

with TLRC staff to schedule an update from the District.
During the interim BBMK will be scheduling meetings with legislators and board members to continue
proactive outreach on behalf of the District. These meetings will be important to continue to foster

SB 267 - What's Next

SB 17-267 authorizes the execution of lease-purchase agreements on state facilities
totaling $2 billion; equal amounts over four years, beginning FY ’18-’19 (which begins
July 1, 2018 but could occur as late as June 30, 2019).
CDOT receives $1.8 billion of those proceeds, with the remainder dedicated to
controlled maintenance and capital projects on state buildings. At least 10% of CDOT’s
proceeds will be dedicated to transit projects.
Proceeds to CDOT may be used for projects that are in the Tier 1 funding in the TenYear Development Plan.
The bill further requires at least 25% of the funds to be expended for projects in
counties with populations of 50,000 or fewer as of July, 2015.
The state General Fund covers the initial payments for SB267 capital construction
projects ($9 M/yr).
CDOT is responsible for the next $50 million annual lease payment related to state
highway projects.
The remainder being paid by the General Fund “or any other legally available source.”
After four years of lease-purchase agreements are executed, the repayment is expected
to reach approximately $150 million per year.
Each lease-purchase agreement would have a term of twenty years.
Additionally, SB 228 transfers for FY ’18 ($79 million) are unaffected, but transfers in FY
’19 and ’20, each $160 million, are eliminated.
While CDOT must be prepared to respond with a list of projects should a petition effort
begin, there is no longer the urgent legislative requirement that a project list be
produced and provided to legislative staff in June, 2017.

Refining the Scope, Schedule, and Costs for the Development Plan
SB 267 projects will come from the Tier 1 portion of the 10-Year Development Plan.
Packet Pg. 8

Attachment: SB267 What%27s Next (2) (3221 : State Update - Brandeberry McKenna)

Scope of Transportation Impacts:

1.C.2.b

The Tier 1 projects on the Development Plan include 74 highway projects previously
totaling about $3.1 billion
 Includes $2.5 billion in unmet needs and $600 million in potential matches from
toll revenue, local partners, and other CDOT programs.

Some of the refinements needed in using the Development Plan as a construction list
include:
 Design Only Projects on Tier 1 list: Some projects included in the Development
Plan are for “design only”.
 Scope Uncertainty: Some corridors do not yet have defined projects, or have not
started the NEPA process. The costs associated with some of those projects were
simply educated guesses made when no funding was available.
 Cost Estimating and Scheduling: Local and state planners created 10 year plan
over a year ago and included cost estimates with various levels of refinement.
Additionally, the time delay in constructing a project was not factored into the
costs (a project built three years from now will cost more than if it were built
today).
These steps will result in the $3.1 billion Tier 1 list growing significantly.
SB 267 timeline means there is additional time work with locals to refine the project
list.
There is no legislative deadline to provide a list related to the lease-purchase proceeds,
and no immediate deadline for selecting projects.
Important to continue the public and Legislature’s trust to be clear on what projects will
be funded.
Next Steps
In June, the Transportation Commission and STAC will see a refined Development Plan
with updated cost estimates, and seek guidance on the timing and process for selecting
projects from the Development Plan to receive lease-purchase proceeds.
CDOT will continue to work with all stakeholders and planning partners as the
department moves towards finalizing a SB267 project list.
CDOT reports to General Assembly on current and future projects annually.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: AUGUST 1, 2017
Congress Advances Transportation Appropriations Bills for FY 2018
House Appropriations

For US DOT, the bill includes $17.8 billion in discretionary appropriations and $76.7 billion in total
Department resources, which is $700 million below FY 2017 enacted levels. This funding reduction is
primarily derived from cuts to the Capital Investment Grant program (New Starts/Small Starts) and the
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, which collectively lose
$1.15 billion when compared to FY 2017. The New Starts program would be funded at $1.75 billion –
significantly less than the $2.30 billion authorized for this program in the FAST Act – but the bill does
include the full $63.26 million requested for RTD’s Eagle P3 full funding grant agreement (FFGA).
Senate Appropriations
The Senate Appropriations Committee’s THUD Subcommittee marked up its FY 2018 transportation
spending bill on July 25. The bill includes $550 million for the TIGER grant program ($50 million above the
FY 2017 level), and $2.133 billion for the New Starts program – sufficient to fund existing FFGAs and new
projects for which project sponsors are prepared to sign FFGAs in FY 2018. While the Senate THUD
appropriations bill has not been released, we expect that it will fully fund RTD’s Eagle P3 project at $63.26
million. The full Senate Appropriations Committee will mark up the THUD appropriations bill on July 27.
Timeline for Further Action on Appropriations Bills
At this time, there is no schedule for consideration of the transportation appropriations bills by the full
chambers of the Senate or House. The current fiscal year ends on September 30, and Congress must act by
passing full-year appropriations bills or even a short-term continuing resolution by that time to keep the
agencies and programs of the Federal Government operating as of October 1. The House begins its August
Recess on July 28, with the Senate following a week thereafter. This means Congress will have one month
after returning to Washington DC in early September (after August recess) to enact such spending legislation.
FTA Announces Grant Opportunities under Buses and Bus Facilities Program
On July 12, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) released its FY 2017 notice of funding opportunity for
the Buses and Bus Facilities competitive grant program. FTA has made available $226.5 million for buses,
bus facilities, and bus equipment. Eligible projects include those that replace, rehabilitate, lease and purchase
buses and related equipment as well as projects to purchase, rehabilitate, construct or lease bus-related
facilities, such as buildings for bus storage and maintenance. Grant applications are due by August 25.
President Trump Establishes Infrastructure Council
On July 19, President Trump issued an executive order to establish an infrastructure advisory council in the
Department of Commerce composed of fifteen members appointed by the President. The members will
represent interests from the following sectors: real estate, finance, construction, communications and
technology, transportation and logistics, labor, environmental policy, regional and local development, and
other sectors. To date, President Trump has not made any appointments to the new Infrastructure Council.
The Council will study the scope and effectiveness of, and make findings and recommendations to the
President regarding: Federal funding, support, and delivery of infrastructure projects. Particularly, the
Council will consider the following: prioritizing the Nation’s infrastructure needs, accelerating preconstruction approval processes, developing funding and financing options, and identifying methods to
increase public-private partnerships. It is our understanding that the Council will not be empowered to
directly make project selections for Federal infrastructure grants and other assistance.

The House Committee on Appropriations has marked up and favorably reported out its FY 2018
Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) appropriations bill on July 17. The House
THUD bill makes some reductions to US Department of Transportation (US DOT) funding levels compared
to FY 2017, and all Democratic amendments to increase funding for programs they support, including
TIGER and New Starts, were defeated in party-line votes.

Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

General

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB
Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.
BACKGROUND
In May of 2017, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base system capital programs and state of good repair
projects for RTD. This contract will award work and authorize budget based on a work order system.
On 6/27/17 RTD received one proposal from the HNTB Corporation.
RTD put together a team with representation from Purchasing, Civil Rights, Quality Assurance, Systems
Engineering and Program Management to evaluate the proposal submitted by HNTB according to the
following evaluation criteria:
Proposals were evaluated according to the following criteria, listed in descending order of
importance:

The evaluation team rated and scored the HNTB proposal and found them to be fully compliant with all
of the evaluation criteria. Based on the proven performance by HNTB in the proposal on RTD and similar
transit systems nationwide, the evaluation team recommended that RTD move forward with award of
the contract to HNTB for Systems Engineering Consulting services.
DISCUSSION
RTD has used a single Systems Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base systems for consistency
and standardization of design. This approach has saved RTD cost and has facilitated the operation and
maintenance of the system. The incumbent Systems Engineering Consultant six-year contract has been
extended once and will have been in place for 12 years by December of 2017. For this reason, RTD
reexamined our needs and advertised for these services in order to secure a Systems Engineering
consultant to complete the FasTracks capital construction program and continue to support RTD’s Base
systems operations and maintenance.

Packet Pg. 12

2.B.1

The selected Systems Engineering Consultant will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing
the Southeast Rail Line Extension, the North Metro Rail Line, and projects on the RTD’s Base System.
The proposed Scope of Work to be performed under this Contract Award Authorization is as follows:


RTD Base System
˗ Prepare PE stamped construction drawings and specifications
˗ Provide project management and administration
˗ Provide coordination and project control, cost estimating, cost control assistance
˗ Prepare construction drawings and specifications for State of Good repair projects that are in
the SBP such as power switch upgrades, traction power studies, traction power PLC
upgrades, OCS wire replacements, signal improvement projects and stray current
measurement.
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering.
˗ Incorporate design changes as requested by the RTD
˗ Provide CADD and Quality Assurance services as required by RTD



North Metro Rail Line
˗ Review systems submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to

System Engineering
˗ Assist RTD in reviewing the Southeast Rail Extension schedule
˗ Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes including
operations and maintenance
˗ Perform field inspections
˗ Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program

The contract award will be for a five-year period of performance with an option for a one-year extension.
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 5%. HNTB has committed to meet the 5% DBE goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where HNTB support would be utilized. Funding for
future year’s scope for the FasTracks projects are identified in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation and
the SBP. Projects requiring additional support identified in the 2016 SBP include: power switching on
emergency crossovers, SE corridor state of good repair, traction power substation PLC upgrade, Welton
St intersections warning signs replacement, stray current measurement and reporting and DUS signage.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for
a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for
Systems Engineering consulting work.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach to project
management and design. This is not recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized
staff to meet the System Engineering needs of the FasTracks Program and Base System. Selection of
alternative two could delay implementation of the FasTracks Program and state of good repair on the
Base system.

INTRODUCTION
This document reports FasTracks
progress through 2015.

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created in
1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to develop, operate,
and maintain a mass transportation system for the beneﬁt of
2.88 million people in RTD's service area which includes all or
part of eight counties in the Metro Denver region. RTD is
governed by a 15 member elected Board of Directors. In
2015, RTD provided over 103 million transit rides.

FasTracks
FasTracks is RTD’s 2004 voter-approved rapid transit
expansion transforming transportation throughout the Metro
Denver region. Upon completion, FasTracks will add 122 miles
of new light rail and commuter rail, 18 miles of Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) and 57 new transit stations to the RTD system.

In 2013, RTD opened the W Line in the West Corridor,
adding 12.1 miles of rapid transit facilities to the existing
34.8-mile rapid transit system. Investment resulted in:
7,600 new transit riders each weekday in the West Corridor
(12,800 weekday transit trips on the W Line).
30,000 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) were removed from
roadways each weekday (9 million VMT removed annually).

In 2014, RTD and their partners completed the construction
and renovations at Denver Union Station, creating one of the
most vibrant spaces in downtown Denver:
Transportation is at the heart of Denver. Again. Union Station
creates a space for locals, tourists, and business travelers to
explore RTD’s network.

85 fewer gas tanks were ﬁlled every weekday (400,000 fewer
gallons of fuel were consumed annually).

Development has been booming near Union Station. Between
2010 and 2015, 2,770 multi-family units, 130 hotel rooms,
900,500 square feet of ofﬁce, and 77,600 square feet of retail
were constructed.

Based on regional crashes/VMT, 23 vehicular crashes could be
prevented every year.

Property value per square foot in the neighborhood surrounding
Union Station increased 56% from $185 in 2010 to $290 in 2015.

At this rate, a life could be saved every 12 years and a severe
injury could be prevented every two years.

Between 2010-2015, 11 B-Cycle stations were added within a
half-mile of Union Station.

In 2014, RTD opened the Free MetroRide, providing a
frequent and reliable connection between Denver Union
Station and Civic Center Station for downtown commuters.
